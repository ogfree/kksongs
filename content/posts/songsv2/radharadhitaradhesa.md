**TRANSLATION**

1) O Lord krsna, O Master of Srimati Radharani, Radha intently worships You and cherishes You, considering You more dear to her than her own life-breath. O Enjoyer of Srimati Radharani, You become conquered by the exalted pure love of Radha. I offer respectful obeisances unto You.

2) O Lord Krsna, the gopis observed a woman's footprints next to Yours, and surmised that Srimati Radharani have given up everything to follow You. (When Your footprints suddenly stopped), the gopis surmised that You had disappeared to cause Radha to repent her own false pride.

3) O Lord Krsna, when the gopis found Srimati Radharani, she described the amazing pastime that had happened. Radha and the other gopis then continually searched for You. O Lord, please protect me.
