**TRANSLATION**

Refrain: Beautiful one, look! As the day comes to an end the eternally playful Lord who wears a garland of forest flowers comes before us.

1) The nectar of His smile extinguishes the burning anguish of the young gopis' eyes. His splendid peacock feather crown moves in the gentle breeze. He is playful and generous.

2) His garland of blossomed lotuses is flooded with dust raised by the cows. His complexion is splendid as a host of suddenly blossomed blue lotuses.

3) He delights you with the sweet muse of His flute. His sidelong glances are waves. His eternal form is handsome. He is charming. He stays with His friends.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

Srila Jiva Gosvami explains that this song describes Lord Krsna return to Vraja from the forest at the end of the day.
