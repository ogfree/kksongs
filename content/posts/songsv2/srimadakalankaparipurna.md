**TRANSLATION**

1) O Lord Nrsimha, O Lord Nrsimha, You are the husband of Sri, the goddess of fortune. You are the death of the greatest demon, Hiranyakasipu. I am sinking into the ocean of birth and death, O Krpalaya, the treasure house of mercy, please protect me.

  
2) O Lord Nrsimha, You are the forest fire of sins of the sinful people who bow down to Your lotus feet. You are known as Garuda -dvaja, whose chariot flag is adorned by Garuda. O Lord Nrsimha, You are the cause of creation and the best shelter. Please protect me and bestow Your mercy upon me which alone can remove the distress of birth and death.

  
3) O Lord Nrsimha, Your raised nails have ripped apart the great demon, Hiranyakasipu. The blood that squirted out made Your chest wet and made it look like that fresh kumkum was applied on You. O Lord Nrsimha, You are the shelter of the best persons including Kamala, the goddess of fortune. You always dwell in Your abode which resembles a lotus flower. I offer my obeisances unto You.

4) O Lord Nrsimha, O Lord Nrsimha, please keep Your illuminating lotus feet on my head which are placed as ornaments on the helmets of the demigods, in the hearts of the yogis and on the nigamas, the Vedic scriptures.

5) O Lord Nrsimha, O Lord Nrsimha, O lotus eyed one, please give me Your audience along with Rama, Your consort riding on the back of Garuda, the king of birds, when all my senses will be suffering in distress and I will be in my last difficulty at the time of giving up my body.

  
6) O Lord Nrsimha, O Lord Nrsimha, Your transcendental body, which is the ultimate shelter of everything, is decorated with a beautiful golden crown, a forest garland, shark like earrings, various excellent jewels and an out projecting wide tongue. Let this form illuminate my mind.

  
7) O Lord Nrsimha, O beautiful One, let my mind always be engaged in enjoying Your form. The sun, the moon and the fire are Your eyes and Your strong arm is beautified by a huge wheel. O Lord Nrsimha, You are the only shelter of goddess Rama (Laksmi ) and You are honored even by Lord Indra.

  
8) O Lord Nrsimha, O Mukunda, Madhusudana, Murari, Vamana, You are the shelter of the surrendered souls. O Lord of the demigods, cause of all causes please do not neglect me. Kindly fulfill my desire of passing my whole life chanting Your holy names.

  
9) O Lord Nrsimha, one who reads these eight prayers daily becomes free from all the fear of sinful reactions. All his desires become fulfilled, kills all his enemies and destroys all kinds of diseases. He will attain the abode of Lord Nrsimha, the Lord reclining on Sesa.
