**TRANSLATION**

1-2) On the banks of the celestial Ganges River I will dwell in a cottage at Surabhi-kunj in Godruma-dhama. This land of Godruma is very conductive for performing devotional worship of the Supreme Lord and is non-different from the sacred place called Nandagram, located in the holy district of Mathura.

3-4) I will put on the garb that is dear to the devotees of Lord Gaurasundara and wear the twelve Vaisnava tilaka markings on my body and beautiful beads of tulasi wood around my neck. Then, by planting flowering trees like Campaka, Bakula, Kadamba, and Tamala, I will make an extensive grove by my cottage.

(5-8) I will put madhavi and malati creepers on the trees and in this way make a shady bower. I will sow a variety of flowering forests and different kinds of jasmine like yuthi, jati and malli. All these will be present there, arrayed in a charming fashion. I will install the empress tulasi on an elevated throne on the terrace, then procure all necessary paraphernalia for having kirtana, such as mrdanga drums, karatalas (hand cymbals), and gongs, and place them there.
