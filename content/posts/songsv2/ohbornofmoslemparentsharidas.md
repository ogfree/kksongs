**LYRICS:**

(1)

Oh born of Moslem parents Haridas!  
And trained in youth in Moslem creed  
Thy noble heart to Vaisnava truth did pass  
Thy holy acts thy candor plead!

(2)

Is there a soul that cannot learn from thee  
That man must give up sect for God  
That thoughts of race and sect can ne'er agree  
With what they call Religion broad

(3)  
Thy love of God and brother soul alone  
Bereft thyself of early friends  
Thy softer feelings oft to kindness prone  
Led on thyself for higher ends!

(4)  
I weep to read that Kazis and their men  
Oft persecuted thee, alas!  
But thou didst nobly pray for th' wicked then!  
For thou wert Vaisnava Haridas!

(5)  
And God is boundless grace to thee, Oh man!  
United thee to one who came  
To save the fallen souls from Evil's plan  
Of taking human souls to shame

(6)  
And He it was who led you all that came  
For life eternal, holy, pure!  
And gave you rest in Heaven's endearing Name  
And sacred blessings ever sure!

(7)  
Thy body rests upon the sacred sands  
Of Svargardvar near the sea,  
Oh, hundreds come to thee from distant lands  
T' enjoy a holy, thrilling glee!

(8)  
The waters roar and storming winds assail  
Thy ears in vain, ah, Vaisnava soul!  
The charms of Vrndavan thy heart regale,  
Unknown the wheel of time doth roll!

(9)

He reasons ill who tells that Vaisnavas die  
When thou art living still in sound  
The Vaisnavas die to live and living try  
To spread the holy name around!

(10)  
Now let the candid man that seeks to live  
Follow thy way on shores of time,  
Then posterity sure to him will give  
Like one song in simple rhyme!
