**LYRICS:**

(Refrain)

suna gopī hari kau sandesa

(1)

sari samādhi antaragati citavau

prabhu kau yaha upadesa

(2)

ve avigata avināsī pūrana

ghaṭa ghaṭa rahe samāya

(3)

tihi niscaya kai dhyāvahu

aise sucita kamala mana lāy

(4)

yaha upāya kari biraha tajaugi

milai brahma tava āya

(5)

tattva jñāna bina mukti na hoī

nigama sunāvata gāya

(6)

sunata sandesa dusaha mādhava ke

gopījana bilakhānī

(7)

sūra biraha kī kauna chalāvai

naina ḍharata ati pane

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) Listen, gopis, to Hari’s message!

1) Meditate on Him, as He rests in all places: this is the eternal lesson of the Lord.

2) He is unknowable, eternal, all\-pervading and dwells in each person.

3) Fix your mind on Him resolutely and bring the lotus feet of Krsna into your heart.

4) By this means, you will lose your lovesickness and find devotion and union to the Supreme Lord.

5) There is no salvation without true spiritual knowledge, as the scriptures have declared this.

6) Hearing Madhava’s unbearable message, the gopis were greatly distressed.

7) Sura Dasa says, “Who can speak of their lovesick pangs of separation as tears flow freely from their eyes?”

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is rendered in Raga Madhuvanti.
