**TRANSLATION**

1) O Krsna, as the spring gradually changed to summer, You played with Your cowherd friends. Your hair clustered like crow feathers, You played hide and seek and pretending-to-be-the-king with them.

2) O Krsna, (accompanied by Your friends) You imitated the movements of the deer and other animals, played on a swing, and in a boat. In this way You played many extraordinary games in many different places.

3) O Krsna, performing pastimes, You appear as the ornament of Bhandiravana forest. Understanding that Pralambasura had arrived, disguised as a cowherd boy, You proposed that the cowherd boys play a game in pairs.

4) O Krsna, in the pastimes where one cowherd boy carried another, You carried Sridama. O Lord, You are very affectionate to Lord Balarama, who caused the terrible demon Pralamba to fall. O Lord, all glories unto You
