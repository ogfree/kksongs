(1)

bātula kahaye “sethā saba nirākāra”

nirviśeṣa tini yena śunyera prakāra”

(2)

rasera bhāṇḍārī tini – “raso vai saḥ”

rasika bhāvuka seve hai tāńra vaśa

(3)

śānta, dāsya, sakhya, vātsalya, rasa ār

sarva rasa śreṣṭha mādhurya rasa sār

(4)

cid-jagate rasa saba hoy upādeya

māyāte tār chāyā mātra kintu saba heya

**TRANSLATION**

1) The madman says, “beyond the material planet, everything is formless. He is no qualities, and there is a limitless of void.”

2) The Lord is a treasure house of rasa. “He is rasa” The devotees who relish the rasa serve him, subserviently.

3) Either by peace, service, friendship, or parenting, they serve Him. However, the essence of all rasa and the topmost rasa is the conjugal love.

4) In the spiritual world, it is very tasteful. In the material world, however, it is just a reflection and it is despicable.
