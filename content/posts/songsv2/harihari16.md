**LYRICS:**

(Refrain)

hari hari ki sela rahila mora buke

ki lagi rasika\-raja  kande sankirtana-majha

na bujhiya manu mano-dukha

(1)

rupa-koti-kama jini  bidagadha-siromani

goloke bihare kutuhale

braja-raja-nandana  gopikara prana-dhana

ki lagi lotaya bhumi\-tale

(2)

sange bilasita yara  radha candrabali ara

kata sata baraja-kisori

ebe pahum buka buka  na dekhena nari-mukha

ki lagi sannyasi danda-dhari

(3)

chadi nagarali-besa bhrame pahum desa desa

patita cahiya ghare ghare

cintamani nija-gune      uddharila jagaj-jane

balarama dasa bahu-dure

(Refrain) Alas! Alas! A javelin is plunged in my chest! Why does the king of the rasikas now weep in the midst of the holy chanting in sankirtana? I do not understand. My heart is filled with pain.

1) Why does He whose handsomeness defeats millions of Kamadevas, who is the crest jewel of the wise and playful, who enjoys blissful pastimes in Goloka, who is Nanda’s son, and who is the gopis’ life-treasure now roll about on the ground?

2) Formerly He enjoyed many pastimes with Radharani, Candravali, and how many hundreds of teenage vraja-gopis? Now the Lord will not even look at a woman’s face. Why did He become a sannyasi holding a danda?

3) Rejecting His garments of a playful lover, the Lord now wanders from place to place. Going from house to house, He visits the fallen people. With the cintamani jewels of His glorious virtues He delivers the people of the world. Only Balarama dasa is left behind.
