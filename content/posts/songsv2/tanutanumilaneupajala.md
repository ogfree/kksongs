tanu tanu milane upajala prema

marakata yaichana beḍhala hema

(2)

kanaka-latāya janu taruṇa tamāla

naba-jaladhare janu bijurī rasāla

kamale madhupa jena pā-ola sańga

duhuḿ tanu pulakita prema-tarańga

(4)

mukha adharāmṛta duhu karu pāna

gobinda-dāsa duhuka guṇa gāna

**TRANSLATION**

1) Their two separate bodies of Divine Couple meet. Ecstatic spiritual love takes birth within Them. They become like a sapphire encircled by gold.

2) They become like a youthful tamala tree and a golden vine. They become like a new rain cloud and nectar lightning.

3) They become like a black bee meeting a lotus. The hairs on Their bodies stand erect. They are splashed by waves of ecstatic spiritual love.

4) They taste the nectar of each other's lips. Govinda dasa sings the divine couple's glories.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is in Raga Bhatiyara.
