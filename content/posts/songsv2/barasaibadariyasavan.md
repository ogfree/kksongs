**LYRICS**

(1)

barasai badariyā sāvan kī,  
sāvan kī man bhāvan kī

(2)

sāvan meń umagyo mero manavā,  
bhanak sunī hari āvan kī

(3)

umaḍ ghumaḍ chahuń disase āyo  
dāmaṇa damake jhar lāvan kī  
  

(4)

nānhīń nānhīń būńdan mehā barasai  
sītal pavan sohāvan kī

(5)

mīrā ke prabhu giradhar nāgar  
ānanda mańgal gāvan kī

**TRANSLATION**

1) It is raining in the month of Savan; I like the rain coming down.  
  

2) In Savan, my heart starts to pine; I hear the sound of Hari coming.  
  

3) The clouds have rolled in from all sides; lightening occurs and it pours.  
  

4) Tiny drops come from the clouds and I enjoy the cool breeze.  
  

5) O lord of Mira, called Giradhar Nagar, The cloudy season is for singing joyfully.

**Remarks/ Extra Information****:**

This can be sung in either Raga Megha or Raga Malhara in Tintal. The content of the song along with the proper raga can allow this song to be a bandish for this raga.
