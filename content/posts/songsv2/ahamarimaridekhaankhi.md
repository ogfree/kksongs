**LYRICS:**

(1)

aha mari mari  dekha ankhi bhari

bhubana-mohana rupa

adwaita ananda-kanda   nityananda

caitanya rasera bhupa

(2)

jini bidhu-ghata      badanera chata

madana garaba hare

lahu lahu hasi      sudha rasi rasi

barare rasera bhare

(3)

kare jhalamala tilaka ujwala

lalita locana bhuru

kiba bahu sobha   muni-mano-lobha

bakra parisara caru

(4)

gale sobhe bhala   nana phula-mala

su-besa basana saje

aruna carana bilasaye ghana-

syamera hrdaya majhe

**TRANSLATION**

1) O! O! O! Fill your eyes with this sight! Look at these glorious forms that charm all the worlds! Look at Lord Advaita, at Lord Nityananda, the root of all bliss, and at Lord Caitanya, the king of the nectar of spiritual love!

2) The glories of Their faces eclipse the glistening moon. They take away Kamadeva's pride. Their gentle gentle smiles bring a flood of nectar, a monsoon rain of nectar.

3) They are effulgent. Their tilaka markings are glorious. Their eyes and eyebrows are graceful. Their glorious graceful arms rest at the side of Their chests, chests that attract the sages’ hearts.

4) On Their necks rests garlands of many different flowers. Their garments are glorious. The reddish soles of their feet gloriously stand in Ghanasyama's heart.
