**TRANSLATION**

1) May Mathura, which is more famous than Vaikuntha, which is a mine of the jewels of the pastimes of Lord Krsna, the crest jewel of all the worlds, which has within it two potencies of eternal and blissful transcendental knowledge: taraka, which brings liberation, and paraka, which brings pure devotion for Lord Govinda, bring great auspiciousness to you all.

2) May Mathura, which is more splendid than millions of moons, which cannot be attacked by the powerful armies of material suffering, where material illusion is afraid to stay, which charms the sages' hearts, which glorifies the Lord's transcendental pastimes, whose doors Brahma, Siva, and all the demigods aspire to guard, and whose glories are sung by the Supreme Lord Himself, give the great treasure of pure devotional service to you all.

3) May Mathura Puri, (where two transcendental potencies, taraka, which is the seed of the tree of liberation and the savior from a host of sufferings, and paraka, which satisfies the thirst for the nectar of pure love of Krsna, arise among the residents,, crush all your sins and give you the treasure of pure love for Lord Krsna.

4) Avanti, hold this betelnut dish in your hand! Gaya, slowly move the fan! Kanci, hold this parasol! Varanasi, carry these two sandals! Ayodhya, don't be afraid! Dvaraka, don't recite these prayers! Mathura-devi has already placed her glance of mercy upon you all.
