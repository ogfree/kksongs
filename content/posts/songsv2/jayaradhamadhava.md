**WORD FOR WORD TRANSLATION: [Jaya Radha Madhava](http://kksongs.org/synonym/j/jayaradhamadhava.html)**

**TRANSLATION**

1) Krsna is the lover of Radha. He displays many amorous pastimes in the groves of Vrndavana, He is the lover of the cowherd maidens of Vraja, and the holder of the great hill named Govardhana.

2) He is the beloved son of mother Yasoda, the delighter of the inhabitants of Vraja, and He wanders in the forests along the banks of the River Yamuna!      

**Remarks/ Extra Information****:**

Srila Prabhupada was very fond of this sort and sang it just before his lectures. In Allahabad and Gorakhpur, Srila Prabhupada fell into a trance after singing the first two lines, and after some time he came back into external consciousness and said, "Now just chant Hare Krsna." Srila Prabhupada said that this song is "a picture of Vrndavana. Everything is there--Srimati Radharani, Vrndavana, Govardhana, Yasoda, and all the cowherd boys."

This song is heard in Raga Kafi, Raga Misra Pilu, and Raga Darbari Kanhada.
