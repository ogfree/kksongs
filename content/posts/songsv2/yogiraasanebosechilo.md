**LYRICS:**

(1)

yogīra āsane bosechilo visvāmitra

janma dilo śakuntalā sundarī pavitra

(2)

ei bhāe yoga bhraṣṭa jñānīra ki kothā

karmī saba mūḍha jana vyathita sarbathā

(3)

kṛṣṇa jāre kṛpā kori upadeśa dena

tini to’ arjuna sama bhāgyavān hana

(4)

āpanāra sukha lāgi yebā yuddha kore

duryodhanera mata se sa-vaḿśete mare

**TRANSLATION**

1) Visvamitra sat on the yogic asana, but he desired Menaka to give birth to the beautiful and pure Sakuntala.

2) In this way the yogis fall down, what to speak of the jnanis, and the karmis are all just asses, suffering in all respects.

3) The one to whom Krsna is merciful and gives His instruction, becomes equally as fortunate as Arjuna.

4) But one who fights for his own happiness' sake, he, like Duryodhana, dies along with his family.
