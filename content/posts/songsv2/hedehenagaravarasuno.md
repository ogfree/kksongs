**LYRICS:**

(1)

hede he nāgara-vara     śuno he muralīdhara

nivedana kari tuyā pāya

caraṇa nakhara maṇi     jeno cāńdera gāńthani

bhāla śobhe āmāra galāya

(2)

śrīdāma sudāma sańge     jakhana vane jāo rańge

takhana āmi duyāre dāńḍāye

mane kari sańge yāi     guru-janāra bhaya pāi

āńkhi rahe tuyā pāne ceye

(3)

cāi navīna megha pāne     tuyā bandhu paḍe mane

elāile keśa nāhi bāńdhi

randhana śālāte jāi     tuyā bandhu guṇa gāi

dhūńyāra chalanā kari kāńdi

(4)

maṇi nao māṇika nao     āńcale bāndhile rao

phula nao je keśe kari veśe

nāri nā karite vidhi     tuyā hena guṇanidhi

laiyā phiritāma deśe deśe

(5)

aguru candana haitāma     tuyā ańge māthā ra-itāma

ghāmiyā paḍitāma rāńgā pāya

ki mora manera sādha     vāmana haye cāńda hāta

vidhi ki sādha pūrābe āmāya

(6)

narottama dāsa kaya     śuno ohe dayāmaya

tumi āmāya nā chāḍiha dayā

ye dina tomāra bhāve     āmāra parāṇa yābe

sei dina dio pada-chāyā

**TRANSLATION**

1) O my dear Hero! O Lord, the flute player! Please hear my request to You. Your jewel-like toenails resemble the rows of moons that I wear like a necklace around my neck.

2) When You go to the forest with Sridama and Sudama, at that time I stand at the doorstep thinking of going with You. But I am afraid of the elders and the respectable people. Therefore, my eyes simply gaze after You.

3) Whenever I see the new clouds, O my friend, I immediately remember You and I let loose my hair. When I cook in the kitchen, I simply sing Your glories and cry on the pretext of smoke.

4) O beloved Lord! You are neither a jewel nor a diamond that I can keep You tied to the end of my cloth. You are not a flower that I can decorate my hair with. If I were not a woman, I could have taken You, the ocean of divine qualities, all over the country.

5) If I were a guru or sandalwood, then I would be smeared on Your limbs, and when You would perspire, I would have fallen at Your reddish lotus feet. What desires I have! Although I am a dwarf, still I want to touch the moon. Will the creator ever fulfill my desire?

6) Narottama dasa says, “Please hear, O most merciful Lord! Please do not neglect me. The day I give up my body being fully absorbed in Your thoughts, please give me shelter at Your lotus feet.
