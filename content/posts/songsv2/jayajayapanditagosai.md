**LYRICS:**

(1)

jaya jaya pandita gosai, jara krpabale se caitanya guna gai

hena se gauracandre jahara piriti

(2)

gadadhara  prananatha jahe lage khyati, gauragata prana prema ke bujhite pare

khetra vasa Krsna seva jara lagi chare

(3)

gadaira gauranga gaurangera gadadhara, sri rama janaki jena eka kalebara

jena eka prana radha vrndavana candra

(4)

tena gaura gadadhara prema taranga, kahe sivananda pahu jara anurage

syama tanu gauranga haiya prema mage

**TRANSLATION**

1) All glories, all glories to Gadadhara Pandit by Whose mercy we can sing Sri Caitanya's glories.

2) His love is such that Gauranga is celebrated as \`Gadadhara's prananatha' (the Lord of Gadadhara). Aho! As Gadadhara's life is Gauranga, His prema is unfathomable -for He renounced his ksetra sannyasa and Gopinatha's seva simply for Gaura.

3-4) Thus Gauranga belongs to Him, and He belongs to Gaura -as Rama and Sita are one body. And just as Radha and Vrndavana candra are one life - so do the waves of prema capsize from Gaura and Gadadhara's lila. Thus Sivananda says: \`Krsna eagerly discards his syama body and becomes Gauranga simply to beg for Radharani's prema!"
