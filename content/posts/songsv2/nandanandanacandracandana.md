**TRANSLATION**

1) The fragrance of Krsna's limbs eclipses the fragrance of sandal paste and camphor. Lord Krsna is more glorious than the monsoon clouds. His neck is more graceful than the conchshell. He is more handsome than an ocean of handsomeness.

2) Gokula's cowherd people all love Him. The saintly beautiful gopis dearly love Him. He is decorated with many flowers. He is graceful and charming. He stays in a forest cottage.

3) Earrings adorn the circles of His cheeks. He wears a peacock-feather crown. He playfully dances. He is expert in a host of graceful rhythms. His arms are great maces.

4) His eyes are lotus flowers. He frees the devotees from a host of sins. His words delight the ear. Govinda dasa takes shelter of His soft and splendid flower-bud feet.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is sung in Raga Tilaka Kamod.
