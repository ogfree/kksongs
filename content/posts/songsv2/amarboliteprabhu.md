**TRANSLATION**

1) Nothing remains “mine”. Father, friend, brother — You are even these to me.

2) Those whom I called friends, wife, sons, and daughters are all Your servants and maidservants. Whatever care I take for them is only as it relates to You.

3) If I continue to maintain my wealth, family members, home, and wife, it is because they are Yours. I am a mere servant.

4) For Your service I will earn money and bear the expense of Your household.

5)  I know neither good nor bad. I merely serve. I am but a watchman who guards the properties in Your household.

6) The exercising of my senses — hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, touching — is done according to Your desire.

7) I no longer do anything for my own pleasure. Bhaktivinoda says, “Your happiness is the essence of everything”.
