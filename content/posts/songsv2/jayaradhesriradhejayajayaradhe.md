**LYRICS**

(Refrain)

jaya rādhe śrī rādhe jaya jaya

rādhe govinda jaya rādhe

(1)

ṭhākura hāmārā nandakīlālā

ṭhākurānī śrīmati rādhe

eka pālakke duntu jana baiṭhane

duntu mukh sundara sāje

rātun carane maṇimaya nūpura

runu junu runu junu bāje

(2)

śyāma-gale vanamālā virāje

rāi-gale mati sāje

śyāma-śire mayūra mukuṭa

rāi-śire veni vani sāje

(3)

śyāma parechan pita vāsa

rāi nīlamvarī sāje

bhuvana mohana sane bhuvana mohinī

ekāsane virāje

(4)

śrī vṛndāvana me kusuma kānane

bhramarā hariguṇa gāoye

śrī vṛndāvana me nikatā yamunā

murali tāna śunāoye

cāchar cikura mayūra kāṇṭhita

kachita keśa virāje

(5)

sārīśuka gāna kare tamālera jale

tapana tanayā mohana muralī

śuni ujāna vahi cale

(6)

mayūra mayūrī rava kokilera dhvani

dāsa manohara karatāi nivedana

dayā kara śrīmati rādhe

(Refrain): All Glories to Sri Radhe! All Glories to the Divine Couple, Radhe Govinda! All Glories! All Glories to Sri Radhe!

1) Our master is the son of Nanda Maharaja. Our master is Srimati Radharani. He takes care of the world in His hands while His beauty adorning the Vrndavana. Their feet are filled with jewels making wonderful sounds.

2) Lord Syama wears a beautiful garland of flowers around His neck, a peacock feather, a sweet crown on His head, and He plays the flute.

3) In the flowers and forests of Vrndavana, the bees sing the glories of Lord Hari. In Vrndavana, in the bank of the Yamuna, everyone can hear the flute.

4) In the beautiful forests of Vrndavana, the peacock feather is inserted in His beautiful attractive hair.

5\. The male and female parrots are on the Tamal tree singing the glories of Lord Hari. All meditators are enchanted by the flute and by hearing it, become instantly attracted.
