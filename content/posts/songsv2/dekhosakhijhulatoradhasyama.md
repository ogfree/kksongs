**LYRICS**

(1)

dekho sakhi jhulato rādhā-śyāma -

vividha yantra, sumeli susvara,

tāna māna suṭhāma

(2)

āṣāḍha gata puna māha śāńana

sukhada yamunā tīra

cāńda rajani, sukhamaya sukhodaya,

manda malaya samīra

(3)

paripūrṇa sarovara, praphullita taru vara

gagane garaje gabhīra

ghora ghaṭā ghana, dāminī damakata,

bindu barikhata nīra

(4)

tahi kalpadruma, tala chāya suśītala

racita ratanahi ḍora

jhulaye tachu para, gori śyāmara,

jhulāye sakhi dui ora

(5)

taḍita ghana janu, dolaye duhu tanu,

adhare mṛdu mṛdu hāsa

vadana hema nīla, kamala vikaśita

sveda bindu parakāśa

(6)

charama heri koi, vījana vījai

karpūra tāmbūla yogāy

suraṭa megha, mallāra gāota

mohana mṛdańga bājāy

(7)

kusuma caya vara, hāra naṭa koto

bhramara guna guna rol

haḿsa śikhi sārasa, susvara śabadita

dāduri ghana ghana bol

(8)

duhuń bhāle candana, cāńda camakita

tilaka racita kapola

cañcala mukuṭa, sucāru candrika

pīṭha pora veṇī dola

(9)

duhuń śravaṇe kuṇḍala, capala jhalamala,

hṛdaye śaśimaṇi hāra

jhalake ābharaṇa, jhańkṛta jhana jhana

jhukita jhulana vihāra

(10)

koi candana gharṣaṇa, sugandhi chirakata,

śyāma gori ańga heri

sakhi bhāṣa ińgitahi, dāsa uddhava,

koroto kusuma ḍheri

**TRANSLATION**

1) “Look, O sakhi, how Radha-Syama are swinging! Various musical instruments are being played, and songs are sung with beautiful voices and with nice rhythms and tunes.”

2) “The month of Asadha (June-July, when it is very hot) is gone and the Sravana month (July-August) has come on the delightful bank of the Yamuna. The moon is rising in the blissful night sky and a gentle Malayan (southern) breeze is blowing.”

3) “The lakes are full and the trees are blooming (due to profuse rain at that time of the year) and the clouds rumble deeply in the sky. The lightning flashes and drops of rain are showered.”

4) “A swing is hung there on jewelled ropes in the cool shade of a wish-yielding tree. On it Gauri Radha and Syama Krsna are seated and pushed by sakhis who stand on each side.”

5) “Their bodies resemble the lightning (Radha) and the clouds (Krsna) as They oscillate on the swing. Their faces, that resemble golden and blue lotusflowers, show drops of perspiration and are adorned with tenderly smiling lips.”

6) “Some sakhi, seeing that the swinging reaches a climax, starts fanning, others offer betel-leaves, and others sing the surata, megha and mallara ragas while playing fascinating mrdanga.”

7) “Radha and Krsna wear excellent flower-garlands that dance in so many ways \[along with the oscillating swing\] while the bees buzz around them. Swans, peacocks and cranes sing with beautiful voices and the frogs croak loudly.”

8) “Radha and Krsna wear sandalwood-tilaka on Their foreheads that astonishes even the moon. Krsna wears a beautiful wiggling peacock-feather crown and Radha has a braid that dangles on Her back down to Her buttocks.”

9) “Their restlessly dangling earrings shimmer on Their ears and They wear moon-stone necklaces on Their chests. Their ornaments glitter and chime along with the rhythm of the swinging. In this way the Jhulan\-pastimes is ended.”

10) “Some sakhis grind fragrant sandalwood. Looking at the limbs of Syama and Gauri some sakhi gives a verbal hint to Uddhava Dasa to go and pick flowers.”

**Remarks/ Extra Information****:**

This song is to be sung in Raga Malhara in Tivra Tala.
