**LYRICS**

(1)

dekho sakhi jhulata yugala kiśora

nīlamaṇi jaḍāola kāñcana jora

lalitā viśākhā sakhī jhulāyata sukhe

ānande magana heri dońhe dońhā mukhe

(2)

garajata gagane saghane ghana ghora

rańgiṇī sańgiṇī gherata cauttara

vividha kusume sabe raciyā hindolā

dolāya yugala sakhī ānande vibholā

(3)

jhulāota sakhīgaṇa karatāli diyā

suvadanī kohe pāche giraye bandhuyā

vigalita dukula udita sveda bindu

amiyā jharaye yeno duhuń mukha indu

(4)

heri sab sakhīgaṇa dońhākāra śrama

cāmara vījana lei koroye sevana

bhramara kokila sab bosi taru ḍāle

rati jaya rādhā-kṛṣṇa rādhā kṛṣṇa bole

kohe jagannātha kobe hobe śubha dine

sakhī sahe dońhākāre heribo vipine

**TRANSLATION**

1) “Look, O sakhi, at the Yugala Kisora on the swing, resembling a sapphire embraced by gold! Lalita and Visakha blissfully push the swing, while the Divine Pair is absorbed in bliss, admiring Each other’s faces!”

2) “Clouds loudly rumble in the sky as Rangini (playful Radhika) sits on the swing, that is decorated with different flowers, surrounded by Her girlfriends that are ecstatically swinging the Divine Pair.”

3) “The sakhis are pushing the swing with their handpalms (so hard that) Suvadani (fair-faced Radhika) says (to Krsna): “O friend! We will fall backwards!” Their garments loosen and the sweat drops that appear on Their moon-like faces resemble drops of nectar.”

4) “Seeing how the Divine Pair perspires of fatigue, all the sakhis begin to serve Them by fanning Them with yaktail fans. The bumblebees and cuckoos are sitting on the branches of the trees and are singing: “Jaya Radha Krsna! Jaya Radha Krsna!” with great love. Jagannatha dasa says: “When will that blessed day be mine when I can see Them both in the forest with the sakhis?”

**Remarks/ Extra Information****:**
