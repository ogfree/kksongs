**LYRICS:**

(refrain)

mhāro praṇāma bāńke bihārī ko

(1)

mora mukuṭa māthe tilaka birāje

kuṇḍala alakā kārī ko mhāro praṇāma

(2)

adhara madhura kara baḿsī bajāvai  
rījha rījhau rādhāpyārī ko mhāro praṇāma

(3)

yaha chabi dekha magana bhaī mīrā  
mohana giravaradhārī ko mhāro praṇāma

**TRANSLATION**

Refrain: My humble obeisances to Banke Bihari!

2) He wears a peacock-crown. His forehead is decorated with tilaka. To the one who has ear-hoops with tress-locks hanging over, my humble obiesances to You!

2) He plays His flute from His beautiful lips! To the one who enchants His dearest Rādhā in a playful way, my humble obeisances to You!

3) Having seen this image of the Lord has captivated and excited Mira Bai. To the enchanting Mohana, the lifter of Govardhana Hill, my humble obeisances to You!
