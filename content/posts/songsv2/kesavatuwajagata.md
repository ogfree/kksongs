(1)

keśava! tuwā jagata vicitra

karama-vipāke,  bhava-vana bhrama-i,

pekhaluń rańga bahu citra

(2)

tuwā pada-vismṛti,  ā-mara jantranā,

kleśa-dahane dohi’ jāi

kapila, patañjali,  gautama, kanabhojī,

jaimini, bauddha āowe dhāi’

(3)

tab koi nija-mate,  bhukti, mukti yācato,

pāta-i nānā-vidha phāńd

so-sabu—vañcaka,  tuwā bhakti bahir-mukha,

ghaṭāowe viṣama paramād

(4)

vaimukha-vañcane,  bhaṭa so-sabu,

niramilo vividha pasār

danḍavat dūrato,  bhakativinoda bhelo,

bhakata-caraṇa kori’ sār

**TRANSLATION**

1) This material creation of Yours, O Kesava, is most strange. I have roamed throughout the forest of this universe in consequence of my selfish acts, and I have beheld many strange and curious sights.

2) Forgetfulness of Your lotus feet has brought on anguish and grief. As I burn in this fire of misery, my would-be saviors — Kapila, Gautama, Kanada, Jaimini, and Buddha — come running to my aid.

3) Each expounds his particular view, dangling various pleasures and liberation as bait in their philosophical traps. They are all cheaters, averse to Your devotional service and thus fatally dangerous.

4) They are magnates of karma, jnana, and yoga who specialize in opinions and proofs for cheating the materially inclined. Bhaktivinoda, considering refuge at the feet of the Vaisnavas as essential, pays his respects to these cheating philosophers from afar.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

While Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura mentioned Lord Buddha in this song, Lord Buddha is an incarnation of Krsna, as described by the Srimad Bhagavatam. However, the philosophy of voidism by Lord Buddha was presented to steer the brahmanas away from the Vedas, as unauthorized animal sacrifices were being performed under the name of the Vedas. For this circumstantial purpose, Vaisnava worship Lord Buddha, but do not follow the teachings as presented by that incarnation.
