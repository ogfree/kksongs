**TRANSLATION**

1) "To become free from debt I bow down before all-powerful Lord Nrsimha, who, to rescue the demigods, was born from a pillar in the palace.

2) To become free from debt I bow down before all-powerful Lord Nrsimha, who is embraced by Goddess Laksmi at His left and who gives blessings to His devotees.

3) To become free from debt I bow down before all-powerful Lord Nrsimha, who wears a garland of entrails and holds a conch, cakra, lotus, and a host of weapons.

4) To become free from debt I bow down before all-powerful Lord Nrsimha. The remembrance of Him destroys all sins and counteracts the poison of snakes.

5) To become free from debt I bow down before all-powerful Lord Nrsimha, whose great lion-roar calms the fears of the elephants who guard the directions.

6) To become free from debt I bow down before all-powerful Lord Nrsimha, the master of the goddess of fortune. He blessed Prahlada and ripped apart the demons' king.

7) To become free from debt I bow down before all-powerful Lord Nrsimha, who gives fearlessness to His devotees when they are troubled by cruel planets.

8) To become free from debt I bow down before all-powerful Lord Nrsimha, who is the master of yajnas, Vedas, Vedanta. Brahma, Siva, and all the demigods bow down before him.

9) This prayer is called Rna-mocana (Prayer to Lord Nrsimha for Release From Worldly Debts). One who regularly reads this prayer is at once freed from debt."
