**TRANSLATION**

1) O Krsna, when You were three or four months old, Your mother performed a great festival to celebrate the auspicious occasion of Your being able to attempt to rise and turn around. She ceremoniously bathed You at that ceremony, but when she saw that Your eyes had all the symptoms of sleepiness, she let You fall asleep in a small bed placed under a large cart.

2) O Krsna, Whose eyes are anointed with black cosmetic, after a time a smile sprouted (upon Your face), Your playful eyes began to restlessly look about, and You placed Your toe in Your mouth.

3) O Krsna, because Your mother was absorbed in the festive activities, she did not hear when you cried for her breast milk. O Lord, You then lifted Your lotus-foot and upturned the cart.

4) O Krsna, when You killed that demon who had assumed the form of a cart, all the people of Vraja were not able to understand what had happened or how. for Your protection, the brahmanas performed a ritualistic ceremony to attain good-fortune, Vedic hymns were chanted to purify You, and You were bathed with water.
