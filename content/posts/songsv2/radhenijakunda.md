**TRANSLATION**

1) Radha, now You may enjoy in the waters of Your own lake! Violently splash the defeated Krsna!

2) Look! In fear He has hidden the splendid crown of flower blossoms in His thick, black hair!

3) The mineral-color pictures drawn on His body have dissolved in the water. His garland has withered and the bees have left it.

4) He places His eternal, ferociously splendid Kaustubha jewel against Your cheek, pretending that You are its reflection.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is sung in Raga Dhanasri.
