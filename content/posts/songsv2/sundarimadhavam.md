**TRANSLATION**

Refrain: O beautiful one, please gaze upon Lord Madhava, whose transcendental form and flower garland both move in the jeweled swing pushed by the hands of Your friends.

1) The sweetness of His pastimes fills all His cowherd relatives and friends. His chest is anointed with sandal kunkuma. His form is splendid as a tamala tree.

2) His forehead is splendidly decorated with gorocana tilaka drawn by the doe-eyed girls of Vraja. The young gopis are enchanted by the moonlight of His face and overwhelmed with amorous longings created by His smile.

3) He is expert in joking. He is decorated with many flowers. He is charming. His chest is broad. He destroys the fears of the surrendered devotees. He is the dear, eternal swan that plays in the Manasa Lake that is the hearts of the Vrajavasis.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is to be sung in Raga Basanta.
