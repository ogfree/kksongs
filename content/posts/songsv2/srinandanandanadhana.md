śrī-nandānandana dhana        tadīya ballabhā-gaṇa

boro bhāgyabāna jei      nije ālambana hoi'

āswādaye se rasa-āsaba

**TRANSLATION**

1-2) The delightful Son of Nanda Maharaja considers all His loving consorts, the gopis, to be His most valued treasure. Both He and they are the foundations of the mellow of conjugal love. This mellow flows back and forth between them all in these two ways: 1) when the rati (affection) flows toward the gopis and takes shelter in their hearts as the object, then Krsna becomes the one and only subject of their love, and 2) when the rati flows toward Krsna and takes shelter in His heart as the object, then the gopis become the one and only subject of His love. In this manner affection flows mutually within the sthayi bhava (the permanent ecstasy) because of the combination of both the subject and object, without which there is no possibility of genuine love existing.

3) Thus there is the necessary functioning of this combination of foundation which contain this love for Krsna, and these mellows are the eternal and topmost goal of all existences. Thus within Vraja, Krsna is known as Gopinatha, the Lord of the gopis. And the most highly valued treasure of this Madana-Mohana is all the cowherd maidens of Vraja, the gopis. Krsna is their dearmost lover, their sweet relisher, and the Lord and Master of Srimati Radharani.

4) Lord Madhava thoroughly enjoys Himself in full eternal bliss as He tastes the internal mellows contained within the principles known as sviya (love within marriage) and parakiya (unwedded love). And one who also becomes one of these basic foundations for sharing these loving exchanges is most fortunate, for she also tastes the maddening wine of these supremely transcendental mellows along with Krsna Himself.
