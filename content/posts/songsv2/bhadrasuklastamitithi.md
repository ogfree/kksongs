**LYRICS:**

(1)

bhādra śuklāṣṭamī tithi, viśākhā nakṣatra tithi

śrīmati janama sei-kāle

madhya dina gata ravi, dekhiyā bālikā chabi

jaya jaya dei kutūhale

(2)

vṛṣabhānupure, prati ghare ghare

jaya rādhe śrī rādhe bole

kanyāra cāńdamukha dekhi, rājā hailā mahāsukhī

dāna dei brāhmaṇa sakale

(3)

nānā dravya haste kari, nagarera yata nārī

ā;ilā sabhe kīrtidā mandire

aneka puṇyera phale, daiva hailā anukūle

e hena bālikā mile tore

(4)

modera mane hena laya, eho ta mānuṣa naya

kon chale kebā janamilā

ghanaśyāma dāsa kaya, nā kariha saḿśaya

kṛṣṇapriyā sadaya hailā

**TRANSLATION**

1) On the eighth day of the bright half of Bhadra\-month, on the day of the Visakha\-constellation, Srimati's birth occured. The sun, having traveled to mid-day and seeing the splendor of the baby girl, said "Jaya Jaya" in great delight.

(2)

In the town of Vrsabhanu, in each and every house, "Jaya Radhe, Sri Radhe" was said. Seeing the moon-face of the daughter, the king became most happy and gave in charity to all brahmanas.

(3) He gave different ingredients to the hands of all the ladies of the village, as they assembled at Kirtida's temple. "As the fruit of so much piety, with the godspeed of destiny, such a baby girl has been given to you!

(4) "We are thinking that she is not an ordinary human at all -- who has taken birth in this disguise?" Ghanasyama Das says, "Have no doubt of it, she will always be dear to Krsna!"
