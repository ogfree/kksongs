**LYRICS:**

(Refrain)

sundari taikhane kahala mu toya

bharamahi tā sañe          leha bāḍhāyali

janama gońāyabi roya

(1)

śuna-ite kānu         muralī-raba mādhurī

śrabaṇe nibāranu tora

hera-ite rūpa       nayāna-yuga jhāḿpalu

taba mohe rokhali bhora

(2)

bini guṇa parakhi          paraka rūpa lālase

kāhe soḿpali nija deha

dine dine khoyabi        iha rūpa-lābaṇī

jība-ite bhela sandeha

(3)

yo tuhu hṛdaye        prema-taru ropali

śyāma-jalada-rasa-āśe

so aba nayana       nīra ghana siñcaha

kahatahiḿ gobinda-dāse

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) O beautiful girl, the enchantment of your love for Him grew stronger and stronger. In the end you will pass this lifetime only in weeping.

1) When you heard the sweetness of Krsna's flute-music, I blocked your ears. When you gazed at Krsna's handsome form, I covered your eyes. You were very determined to be enchanted by Him.

2) For no reason you pined to attain Him. What has become of your body? Day after day the beauty of your body wasted away. Now even your life is in doubt.

3) In your heart you planted the tree of love for Him. You expected the dark rain cloud of Krsna would water that tree with its nectar rains. Alas! Now that tree is watered only with the tears from your eyes. This Govinda dasa says.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**
