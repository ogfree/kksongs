**LYRICS:**

(1)

ke go a-i gaura-baraṇa bāńkā bhuru bāńkā nayana

cina cina cina yena kari

e-i nā se nandera gopāla yaśodāra jīvana dulāla

ā-ila kari gopīra mana-curi

(2)

śire chila mohana cūḍā ebe māthā kaila neḍā

kaupina parila dhaḍā chāḍi

gopī-mana mohanera tāre mohana-baḿśī chila kare

ebe se ha-ila daṇḍa-dhārī

(3)

nīpa-taru-mūle giyā adhare muralī laiya

rādhā-nāma karita sādhana

ebe suradhunī-tīre bāhu duṭī ucca ka’re

sadāi karaye sańkīrtana

(4)

nabīna nāgara sāje gopī-saha kuṇja-mājhe

karita ye bibidha bilāsa

ebe pāriṣada sańge nāma yāce dīna-beśe

sei ei kahe kānu-dāsa

**TRANSLATION**

1) Look! Look! Look! Who is this person with a fair complexion, with curved eyebrows and eyes with crooked glances?  He cannot be Nanda’s gopa son! He cannot be Yasoda’s beloved son! He cannot be the boy that robbed the gopis of their hearts!

2) In the past His hair was glorious. Now His head is shaved. Now He wears a kaupina and a sannyasi’s garments. In the past He charmed the gopis’ hearts. In the past He played charming melodies on his flute. Now He carries a sannyasi’s danda.

3) In the past He sat under a kadamba tree, placed the flute to His lips, and played melodies that were actually songs chanting Radha’s name. Now He stands by the Ganga’s banks, raises His arms, and always sings in sankirtana.

4) In the past He was the teenage hero of amorous pastimes. In the past He enjoyed many pastimes with the gopis in the middle of the forest. Now He wears the garments of a sannyasi. Accompanied by His companions, He begs everyone to accept the chanting of Krishna’s holy names. Thus spake Kanu Das.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This is sung in Raga Suhai.
