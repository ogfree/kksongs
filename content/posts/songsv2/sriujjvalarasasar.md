**TRANSLATION**

1) The most brilliant mellow of conjugal love has two natural divisions: vipralambha (separation) and sambhoga (enjoyment together). The pleasure felt in union cannot be properly appreciated without the experience of suffering in separation. That is the function of vipralambha.

2) There are four types of vipralambha, namely 1) purva\-raga (preliminary affection), 2) mana (pouting), 3) pravasa (distant sojourn), 4) prema-vaicittya (feeling separation even in the presence of the lover). The purva\-raga is the infatuated condition that arises prior to union as a result of either seeing or hearing about the lover.

3) Mana arises when one of the attached couple starts pouting and becomes firmly determined to stay aloof from the other, being averse even to looking at the other. This particular state of affection has two sides to it, namely sahetu mana (pouting for a good reason), and nirhetu mana (pouting for no reason at all). These are standard twists which commonly occur during the course of transcendental loving affairs.

4) Sahetu mana can be pacified by: 1) sama (pleasing words of consolation). 2) bheda (witty remarks), 3) kriya (worship), 4) dana (giving presents), 5) nati (falling down at the feet), 6) upeksa (indifference). When a pouting festival is created by nirhetu mana, it can be mitigated very quickly by being in a beautiful place, or by the passing of time, or simply by the sound of flute-music.

5) Prema-vaicitya comes about even in the presence of the lover by an intense fear of impending separation, thus causing an unusual transformation of the heart. This is a natural characteristic of pure prema. The symptom known as pravasa comes about when one's beloved has traveled to another forest, town or country. Thus there are four stages of vipralambha (love-in-separation).
