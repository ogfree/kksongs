**LYRICS:**

(1)  
gaurā pahu nā bhajiyā goinu  
prema-ratana-dhana helāya hārāinu

(2)  
adhane yatana kari dhana teyāginu  
āpana karama-doṣe āpani ḍubinu

(3)  
sat-sańga chāḍi' kainu asate vilāsa  
te-kāraṇe lāgilo ye karma-bandha-phāńsa

(4)  
viṣaya-viṣama-viṣa satata khāinu  
gaura-kīrtana-rase magana nā hainu

(5)  
keno vā āchaye prāṇa ki sukha pāiyā  
narottam dās keno nā gelo mariyā

**TRANSLATION**

1) I did not worship Lord Gauranga Prabhu and thus I became full of suffering.  I refused to accept the treasure of pure love of Krsna, and thus I became lost.

2) I reject the treasure of love of Krsna and deliberately struggled to become poor.  I dived into a host of sinful deeds.

3) I rejected the association of the saintly devotees, and instead tried to enjoy among the impious non-devotees.  In this way I became caught in the noose of karma.

4) I continually drank the virulent poison of sense-gratification.  I refused to swim in the nectar of Lord Caitanya's sankirtana movement.

5) Why do I stay alive?  What happiness do I have?  Why did Narottama dasa not die long ago?
