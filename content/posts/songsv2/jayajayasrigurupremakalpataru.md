**LYRICS**

(1)

jaya jaya śrī guru, prema kalapa taru

adbhuta yāko prakāśa

(2)

hiyā ageyāna, timira vara jñāna

sucandra kiraṇe koru nāśa

(3)

iha locana ānanda dhāma

ayācita eheno patita heri yo pahuń

yāci deyalo harināma

(4)

duragati agati, asata mati yo jana,

nāhi sukṛti lava leśa

(5)

śrī vṛndāvana, yugala bhajana dhana,

mohe korolo upadeśa

(6)

niramala gaura, prema rasa siñcane,

pūralo saba mana āśa

(7)

so caraṇāmbuje, rati nāhi hoyalo

royata vaiṣṇava dāsa

**TRANSLATION**

1) “All glories to Sri Guru, the wish-yielding tree of Love of God, whose manifestation is so astonishing.”

2) “With the nice moonbeams of his knowledge he destroyed the deep darkness of ignorance in my heart.”

3) “He is the abode of bliss for the eyes. Seeing this fallen soul, he gave me Harinama, which is coveted by everyone, although I did not even ask for it.”

4) “This person is hell bound and helpless, and my intelligence is totally corrupt. I do not even have a drop of pious merit.”

5) “He instructed me in the treasure of the worship of the Divine Couple Sri-Sri Radha-Krsna in Sri Vrndavana.”

6)  “By showering me with the spotless prema rasa which is given by Lord Gauranga, he fulfilled all my desires.”

7) “Vaisnava Dasa weeps: I did not attain loving attachment to the lotus feet of my Gurudeva.”
