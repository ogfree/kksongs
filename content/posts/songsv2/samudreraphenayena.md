**LYRICS:**

(1)

samudrera phenā yena kṣaṇe sṛṣṭi loy

māyār saḿsāre khelā sei bhāve hoy

(2)

keho nahe pitā mātā ātmīya svajana

sabāi phenāra mata thāke alpa-kṣaṇa

(3)

samudrera phenā yemona samudre miśāya

pañca bhūtera deha tathā haye jāy laya

(4)

koto deha ei bhāve dharaye śarīrī

anitya śarīre mātra ātmīyā tāhāri

**TRANSLATION**

1) Just as foam arises in the ocean and dissolves in a moment, the play of illusion in the material is just like that.

2) There is no mother, father, relateive, or family. Everyone, like the foam in an ocean, only remains for a brief moment.

3) Just as foam in the ocean mixes with the ocean, likewise, the five elements of the body merges again after it dies.

4) In this manner, how many bodies has the spirit soul entered? Their relatives are temporarily related to the body.
