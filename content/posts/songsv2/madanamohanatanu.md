**LYRICS:**

(1)

madana-mohana tanu gauranga sundara

lalate tilaka sobho urdhwe manohara

(2)

tri-kaccha basana sobhe kutila-kuntala

prakrta nayana du-i parama cancala

(3)

sukla-yajna-sutra sobhe bediya sarire

suksma-rupe ananta ye hena kalebara

(4)

adhare tambula hase adhara capiya

yaga brndabana dasa se-rupa nichiya

**TRANSLATION**

1) Graceful Lord Gauranga is more enchanting than Kamadeva. Glistening Vaisnava tilaka adorns His forheead.

2) He wears glorious trikaccha garments. His hair is curly. His two eyes are naturally restless.

3) Manifesting a very slender form, Lord Ananta has become His white sacred-thread.

4) On His lips rest betel nuts and a smile. Vrndavana dasa worships Him.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

The song is based on Raga Suhai.
