**LYRICS:**

(Refrain)

sundari hari-abhisarika lāgi

naba anurāge        gorī bheli śaḿari

kuhu-yāminī-bhaya bhāgi

(1)

nīlima mṛgamade       tanu anurañja-i

nīlima hara ujora

nīla-balayā-gaṇa         bhuja-yuga-maṇḍita

pahirali nīla nicola

(2)

nīla alakākula        alike hilolata

nīla timire calu go-i

nīla nalina yaiche       śāmaru sāyare

lakha-i nā pāra-i ko-i

(3)

nīla-bhramara-gaṇa         parimale dhāba-i

caudike karata jhańkāra

gobinda-dāsa        ata\-e anumāna-i

rā-i calali abhisāra

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) The beautiful girl goes to Her meeting with Krsna. Overcome with new found love, the fair girl has become black. The black night is fearsome.

1) Black is the musk that anoints Her. Black is Her glistening necklace. Black are the bracelets that adorn Her wrists. Black is Her bodice.

2) Black are the curly locks of hair that toss like waves on Her forehead. In the black darkness She stealthily walks. Black now are the lotus flowers. Blackness was brought by the sunset. No one can see anything.

3) Black are the bumblebees chasing the sweet fragrance. Their buzzing fills the four directions. Govinda dasa says: I can only guess that Sri Radha is now running to meet with Krsna.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is sung in Raga Tilaka Kamod.
