**LYRICS:**

(1)

palya-dāsī kori lalitā sundarī

amare loiyā kabe

śrī-rādhikā-pade kale milaibe

ajña-sebā samarpibe

(2)

śrī rūpa mañjarī sańge jabo kabe

rasa-seba-śikṣa-tare

tad-anugā hoye rādhā-kuṇḍa tate

rohibo harṣitāntare

(3)

śrī viśākhā-pade sańgīta śikhibo

kṛṣṇa-līlā rasamaya

śrī rati mañjarī śrī rasa mañjarī

hoibe sabe sadaya

(4)

parama ānande sakale miliya

rādhikā caraṇe rabo

ei parākāṣṭhā siddhi kabe habe

pabo rādhā-pada saba

**TRANSLATION**

1) When will Lalita Sundari foster me as her own aspirant novice maidservant? Then later she will offer me up unto the lotus feet of Srimati Radharani, and will place me entirely at Her disposal for rendering various services according to Her own merciful orders.

2) When will Sri Rupa Manjari take me along with herself to the banks of Sri Radha-kunda to give me lessons in the performance of services to the transcendental mellows? She will take me there and make me practice by following her instructions and movements. Thus I will pass my time feeling great delight within my heart.

3) At the lotus feet of Sri Visakha I will learn music and songs which are all abounding in the transcendental mellows of Krsna's pastimes. All of the other sakhis in our group, including Sri Rati Manjari and Sri Rasa Manjari, will also share their most kind and affectionate dealings with me.

4) All of us will meet together, feeling the greatest supreme bliss, and we will remain by the lotus feet of Sri Radhika. When, oh when will there be this highest excellence of the culmination of spiritual perfection, whereby I will receive the intoxicating honey flowing from the lotus feet of Srimati Radharani?
