**LYRICS:**

(1)

gahana birahaka lāgi

rajanī pohāya-i jāgi

(2)

karatahi tohari dheyāna

to bine ākula kāna

(3)

śītala pīta nicola

tohari bharame karu kora

(4)

so rasa paraśa nā pā-i

mūrachita dharaṇī loṭā-i

(5)

manamahā madana-tarāńga

ghana ghana moḍa-i ańga

(6)

kahatahi gada gada bhāṣa

nā bujhala gobinda-dāsa

**TRANSLATION**

1) Overcome with feelings of separation, He stays awake the whole night.

2) He meditates on You. Without You, Krsna is very unhappy.

3) Bewildered, He embraces His yellow cloth. He thinks the cloth is You.

4) He cannot taste any sweetness. Fainting, He falls to the ground.

5) His heart is tossed to and fro by Kamadeva's waves. His limbs are bent.

6) He speaks broken words in a choked voice. Govinda dasa does not understand what has happened to Him.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is sung in Raga Suhai.
