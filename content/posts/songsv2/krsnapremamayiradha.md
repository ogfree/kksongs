**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song can be rendered in Raga Sindhu Bhairavi in Kaherva Tala.

The author and part of the song lyric is disputed. Many sources identify this song as “Krsnastakam” by Sri Vallabhacarya, while other sources identify this song as “Yugalastakam” by Srila Jiva Goswami.

The third line in each verse differs between the variations. Other sources say “jīvane nidhane”, which translates to “in life and in death.”
