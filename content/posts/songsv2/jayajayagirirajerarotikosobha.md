**LYRICS**

(1)

jaya jaya girirajer aratika sobha  
sri-braja-mandala majhe jaga mana lobha

(2)

pramoda-madana-lila sri-radha-ramana  
yatha nitya-lila kare laye sakhi-gana

malati-madhavi-kunja kandare kandare  
nigudha nikunja-lila hari manohare

(4)

syama-kunda radha-kunda kusuma sarovara  
manasa ganga dana-ghati yara abhyantara

(5)

sevya o sevaka-rupe nitya parakasa  
sanande arati dekhe e adhama dasa

5) With Sri Govinda Kunda, these holy places of divine Pastimes are without limit. Day and night the devotees are performing circumambulation in worship.

  
6) Here there is the supremely beautiful Sridhar Swami Sevasram where devotees of Sri Chaitanya Saraswat Math are performing their eternal service.

7) Sriman Mahaprabhu gave Sri Sri Giriraj-jiu to Sri Raghunath Goswami so that Sri Das Goswami could worship His Lordship knowing Him to be non-different from Krishna.

8) The devotees of Sri Chaitanya Saraswat Math worship Sri Sri Giriraj-jiu in a deep mood of devotion in remembrance of Sri Raghunath Dasa Goswami.
