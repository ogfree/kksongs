**LYRICS:**

(Refrain)

dekhalu gaurāńgacandra bibhora

kali-yuga kaluṣa-timira-ghora-nāśaka

nabadwīpa cānda ujora

śohata gati ati manda

dīna jane nija bīja  saba de-i tārala

bañcita dāsa gobinda

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) I saw Lord Gaurangacandra. Now I am overcome. Lord Gaura is a splendid moon rising in Navadvipa, a moon that destroys the horrible darkness of Kali-yuga's sins.

1) His complexion is fair. His form is splendid, enchanting, handsome, sweet, and graceful. His garments defeat the peerless rising sun. His face is handsome and graceful.

2) His eyes are restless with ecstatic spiritual love. He frees everyone from the bonds of repeated birth and death. His graceful form is overcome with newer and newer ecstatic spiritual love. He stays amongst the devotees.

3) He gently smiles. He speaks sweet words. His slow movements are graceful. Giving them the seed of ecstatic spiritual love, He delivers the poor fallen people. Only Govinda dasa He did not deliver. Only Govinda dasa was cheated.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is sung in Raga Tilak Kamod.
