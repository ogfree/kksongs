**LYRICS:**

(1)

“nir-dvandva vaiṣṇava śudhu japa kore mālā”

boloye ei rūpa yā’rā khāy mana kola

(2)

vaiṣṇava nirīha, akṛta droha, hoy to svabhāve

kintu nahe hīna vīrya yathā loka bhāve

(3)

bhāratera dui yuddhe dui mahāśaya

vaiṣṇaver agraṇī tārā korilo vijaya

(4)

nijendriya tṛpti vāñchāya yuddhi nāhi kore

vaiṣṇava boliyā tāi vidita saḿsāre

**TRANSLATION**

1) “The Vaisnava, freed from duality, simply chants japa on his beads.” Those who say that are eating the mind's bananas.

2) The Vaisnava is without desire, and amicable by nature, but he is not a forceless weakling as people foolishly think.

3) In two great Indian wars (Mahabharata and Ramayana), two great personalities (Arjuna and Hanuman) were leaders amongst the Vaisnavas, and were victorious.

4) Because of desire for the satisfaction of his own senses he would not fight. But he is one who is known by everyone as a Vaisnava.
