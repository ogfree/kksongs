**TRANSLATION**

Refrain: Now that Syama has left Braja, who else will play the flute?

1) Since Syama has left Braja, the beautiful lotus-like Radharani is so unhappy that She is constantly weeping.

2) While decorating a forest bower with wildflowers, Radharani exclaims, “My dear friend, all night I lie awake weeping and trembling, because Syama will not be coming. He is no longer in Braja!”

3) Due to separation of Syama both male and female parrots are weeping, along with the cowherd girls of Braja. Syama is no longer playing the flute and the cows no longer go out to the pasture. “My dear friend, our life and soul, Krsna, has left Braja!”

**Remarks/ Extra Information**:

This song was found in a Bengali Krsna bhajans album. This song was also popularized by Vaiyasaki Das through his 1996 album, Divya Lila. Both sung this bhajan in Raga Misra Kafi and Pilu and Bhajani and Dadra Tala, respectively.

There are some variations from the above version.

Some renditions of this song may begin with “ke ār bājābe bāḿśi.”

Verse 2: Third line: “koto niśi kāńde rase” (“For many nights, I cry endlessly.”)

Verse 3: The first and second lines may be reversed. For the last line: “cheḍe geche brajapurī, brajera kanāi.” (“Vraja’s own Kanai \[Krsna\], has left the village of Vraja.”)

This is the sister song to “**[Ke Abar Bajaye Bamsi](http://kksongs.org/songs/k/keabarbajayebamsi.html)**.”
