**TRANSLATION**  
1) At the end of the night of Sri Sri Vrsabhanunandini, She suddenly took him to her entourage, withdrawing him from the company of throngs of grief-stricken souls. A great cry of lamentation arose, their bodies were bathed by their tears. When he was thus stolen away, this world was plunged into the deep darkness of one whose eyes have been stolen away (hrta - stolen away; nayana-mani - jewel of the eye - the internal name of Saraswati Thakura is 'Nayana-mani'). (Bereft of the vision of my Divine Master,) O my sorrowful eyes (dina-nayana), (or, O savior of the fallen \[Dina-nayana\],) wherever that great soul may be, please quickly take this servitor there! (Although he is my Master named 'Nayana,' or 'one who brings us near,' in his mercy he shows the miserliness of not taking me unto his company.)

  
2) From his lotus feet, the nectarine river of divine love flows throughout the universe; his servitors, like bees, maintain their lives drinking the honey that falls from his lotus feet; and the pure devotees in the shelter of the confidential mellows of Vraja revel in the bliss of singing the glories of his lotus feet: O Dina-nayana, wherever that great soul may be, please quickly take this servitor there.

  
3) Parental affection, so highly esteemed in the world, is a colossal hoax (as an obstacle to Hari-bhakti); socially recognized pure matrimonial love is nothing but dacoitry (in that it plunders away both the husband's and the wife's eagerness for the chance to acquire the treasure of love unadulterated by the superficiality of familial prejudice); and common friendship is merely deception: I have gleaned these thoughts from the rays of light that emanate from the toenails of the holy feet of that great personality, the embodiment of supramundane affection. O Dina-nayana, wherever that great soul may be, please quickly take this servitor there.

  
4) The divine message sung by Sri Krsna Caitanyacandra had its continuous play in the ears of the people. From the ear, did he, just to fulfill the purport of the name 'Nayana-mani,' reveal his form to the eye, making his advent in the mansion (temple) favored by the glance of Sri Nilacalacandra (at the time of the Rathayatra festival)? O Dina-nayana, wherever that great soul (Mahapurusa) may be, please swiftly take this servitor there.

  
5) Drawing up the pure golden waters of the Jambu River mentioned in Srimad-Bhagavatam, has this golden cloud arisen on the mountain where the golden moon (Sri Gauracandra) descended (set), just to shower down torrents of rain upon the whole countryside that was scorched by the forest fire (of threefold sufferings), then suddenly conceal himself in the dust of the land of the Advent of Sri Gauranga? O Dina-nayana, wherever that Great Master may be now, please quickly take this servitor to that place.

6) He is of the same hue as Sri Gaura, and although he, who sings the tidings of Sri Gaura, is the (natural) Guru of the whole universe, he accepted discipleship to a great devotee called Sri Gaura Kisora ('adolescent Gaura'). In the whole Gaura-mandala he is the repository of the glory of those who grant entrance into the fold of the pure Gaudiya Vaisnavas. He proudly ascended the lofty throne of preaching the glories of the gift of the Golden Lord Sri Gaura (the service of Sri Radha-Govinda in Vraja) to the Vaisnavas of Dravida (the devotees in South India, who are generally worshippers of Laksmi-Narayana). The glory of his dignity shines even in the group of Sri Gandharva, and he holds a pre-eminent position in the intimate circle of Sri Giridhari, that is, he is the most beloved of Lord Mukunda. O Dina-nayana, where that great soul is now, please swiftly take this servitor there.

  
7) He inundated the whole universe of countless living beings - whether brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya, sudra, less than sudra, and even mleccha - with the oceanic nectar of the holy name of Sri Radha-Krsna. Although unapproachable by the liberationists and yogic perfectionists, he is known as the friend of the fallen, the mercy potency of Sri Gauranga. O Dina-nayana, wherever that great soul may be, please swiftly take this servitor there.

  
8) Do I have a hope to ever see that beautiful golden personality who makes everything auspicious for the world? Do I have a hope to ever behold that tall figure once again, his blue lotus eyes, his nose that excels the charm of the Tila flower, his forehead that shames the half-moon, his graceful lotus face, his gleaming pearl-white teeth, his long arms extending to his knees? O Dina-nayana, wherever that great soul has gone, please swiftly take this servitor there.

9) In the year of our Lord Gauranga 450, in the month of Pausa, on the fourth day of the dark fortnight of the moon in the star of Magha, at the closing of the night of Brhaspativara (5.30 a.m., 1st January, 1937), that most beloved attendant of Srimati Vrsabhanunandini entered into the eternal pastimes. O Dina-nayana, wherever that great soul may be, quickly take this servitor there to him.

  
10) The entire earth and skies were filled with the cries of anguish of the people, and of the disciples devoted to the service of Sri Gurudeva's lotus feet. Where has that Great Master gone? Alas! today the whole universe seems empty, in the separation of Prabhupada. The servitor of Gurudeva cannot endure even a moment of his separation. O Dina-nayana, wherever, wherever that great soul may be, please quickly take this servitor there to him.
