**LYRICS**

(1)

Adore, adore ye all The happy day

Blessed than heaven Sweeter than May.

When he appeared at Puri The holy place,

My Lord and Master His Divine Grace.

(2)

Oh! my Master The evangelic angel.

Give us Thy light Light up Thy candle.

Struggle for existence A human race.

The only hope His Divine Grace.

(3)

Misled we are All going astray,

Save us Lord Our fervent pray.

Wonder thy ways To turn our face

Adore Thy feet Your Divine Grace.

(4)

Forgotten Krsna We fallen souls,

Paying most heavy The illusion's toll.

Darkness around All untrace.

The only hope His Divine Grace.              

(5)

Message of service Thou hast brought,

A healthful life As Caitanya wrought.

Unknown to all It's full of brace.

That's your gift Your Divine Grace.

(6)

Absolute is sentient Thou hast proved

Impersonal calamity Thou hast moved.

This gives us a life Anew and fresh.

Worship Thy feet Your Divine Grace.

(7)

Had you not come Who had told

The message of Krsna Forceful and bold.

That's your right You have the mace

Save me a fallen Your Divine Grace.

(8)

The line of service As drawn by you

Is pleasing and healthy Like morning dew.

The oldest of all But in new dress

Miracle done Your Divine Grace.
