**LYRICS:**

(1)

rāma jinakā nāma hai, ayodhyā jinakā dhāma hai,

aise śrī raghunātha ko, bārambāra praṇāma hai

(2)

kauśalyā jinakī mātā hai, daśaratha jinake bābā hai,

aise kṛpā-nidhāna ko, bārambāra praṇāma hai

(3)

viśvāmitra yajña rakhavāre, gautama nāri ahalyā tāre,

aise karuṇā dhāma ko, bārambāra praṇāma hai

(4)

rājā janaka ke tāpa miṭāye, sītā byāhi ayodhyā lāye,

aise sītānātha ko, bārambāra praṇāma hai

(5)

pitā vacana se vipina sidhāre, sańga jānakī lakṣmaṇa pyāre,

śabarī ke priya rāma ko, bārambāra praṇāma hai

(6)

dhanuśa bāṇa ke dhāraṇa-hāre, rākṣasa māri kaṣṭa saba tāre,

hanumān ke prāṇa ko, bārambāra praṇāma hai

**TRANSLATION**

1) He whose name is Rama, and whose abode is Ayodhya – unto such the Lord of the Raghu Dynasty, I offer my most humble obeisances, again and again.

2) He whose mother is Kausalya, and whose father is Dasaratha – unto such an abode of mercy, I offer my most humble obeisances, again and again.

3) Lord Ramacandra protected Sage Visvamitra’s fire sacrifices from demons Subahu and Marica, He redeemed Ahilya, Sage Gautama’s wife, from his curse. Unto such a merciful Lord, I offer my most humble obeisances, again and again.

4) Lord Ramacandra relieved King Janaka from his humiliation and miseries by marrying his daughter, Sita. He accepted Sita as His wife and came back to Ayodhya. Unto the Lord of Sita Devi, I offer my most humble obeisances, again and again.

5) To honor the promise of his father to live in the forest for fourteen years and abdicate the throne, Lord Ramacandra went with His wife, Sita (Janaki), and His dear brother, Laksmana. Unto the dear Lord of Sabari, Lord Ramacandra, I offer my most humble obeisances, again and again.

6) He is Lord Hari, Himself, adorned with a bow and arrows. He killed the demoniac class of men (raksasas), thus redeeming them, and relieved suffering in the word. To the life and soul of Hanuman, I offer my most humble obeisances, again and again.
