(1)

viṣaya-vimūḍha ār māyāvādī jan

bhakti-śūnya duńhe prāna dhare akāraṇ

(2)

ei dui-sańga nātha! nā hoy āmār

prārthanā koriye āmi caraṇe tomār

se duwera madhye viṣayī tabu bhālo

**TRANSLATION**

1) Both the monist philosophers and those bewildered by worldly affairs live in vain, for both are devoid of devotion to You.

2) I pray at Your lotus feet, O Lord, that I may be spared the company of them both.

3) Yet of the two the worldly man is better. I ask never to have the company of mayavadi.

4) When the worldly man enters into the company of saintly persons within his heart he becomes inspired by pure devotion through the mercy of those devotees.

5) But woe to him who has known the offensive presence of impersonalist philosophy. Such sophistry makes the heart hard as a thunderbolt.

6) The mayavada philosopher declares that the true form of bhakti, its object (Sri Krishna), and its possessor (the devotee) are all transitory and thus illusory.

7) Fie on his pretense of service to Krishna, of hearing and chanting His glories! His so-called prayers strike the body of Krishna with blows more cruel that a thunderbolt.

8) There is no philosophy as antagonistic to devotional service as mayavada philosophy. Therefore I do not desire the association of the mayavadi.

9) Bhaktivinoda drives away the philosophy of illusionism and sits safely in the society of Vaisnavas under the shelter of the holy name.
