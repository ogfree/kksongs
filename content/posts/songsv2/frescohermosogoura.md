**LYRICS:**

(1)

Fresco hermoso Goura, flechas de flores carga

Nuevas emociones, nueva danza baila

Fresca sonrisa, de oro Su bella forma

Adoro a Saci Suta, al hermoso Goura

(2)

Como oro nuevo, suave cual mantequilla

De ropas nuevas, prueba el rasa con Krsna

Su prema brilla en nueve amorosas formas

Adoro a Saci Suta, al hermoso Goura

(3)

Supremo en Hari bhakti, cuida el Harinama

Cientos de lágrimas Sus ojos derraman

Sus manos por japa, el canto lo emociona

Adoro a Saci Suta, al hermoso Goura

(4)

El dolor de los hombres por siempre acaba

De toda meta la más elevada

Borra el dolor del mundo, en abejorro transforma

Adoro a Saci Suta, al hermoso Goura

(5)

Su bhakti enseña, a Sus amados atrae

A Krsna lleva con Su hermoso baile

La mente baila encantada en Su gloria

Adoro a Saci Suta, al hermoso Goura

(6)

Junto con kartals melodioso canta

Lo sigue la vina que dulce entona

Así inspira un baile que en bhakti se encanta

Adoro a Saci Suta, al hermoso Goura

(7)

Da el yuga dharma, es el hijo de Nanda

Medita en Su forma, Su dham Lo acompaña

De este mundo salva a quien Lo adora

Adoro a Saci Suta, al hermoso Goura

(8)

Tiembla Su voz que Sus nombres repite

Despierta a la vida todo cuanto existe

Sus ojos, Sus pies, Su ropa, cual auroras

Adoro a Saci Suta, al hermoso Goura

**TRANSLATION**

1) His complexion is the hue of fresh cream tinged with kunkum. He is the ever-fresh Cupid who shoots arrows of newly blossoming flowers. He bears newer and newer moods of emotional ecstasies. He is fond of performing novel dances. He makes ever-new jokes that cause much laughter. His brilliant luster is like freshly cast gold.—I bow down to Gaura, the beautiful son of Mother Saci.

2) He is endowed with ever-fresh love of Godhead. His radiant luster is like the color of fresh butter. His fresh attire is arranged in ever-new fashions. He relishes ever-new mellows of love for Krsna. He shines in nine-fold new ways while executing the nine-fold processes of devotion. He is permeated with a most auspicious loving nature.—I bow down to Gaura, the beautiful son of Mother Saci.

3) He is absorbed in devotion to Sri Hari. He maintains the chanting of the names of Hari. While chanting He counts the holy names on the fingers of His hands. He is addicted to the name of Hari. He always has tears of love welling in His eyes.—I bow down to Gaura, the beautiful son of Mother Saci.

4) He is always removing the suffering of material existence for mankind. He is the goal of life for persons who are dedicated to their supreme interest. He inspires men to become like honeybees (eager for the honey of Krsna-prema). He removes the burning fever of the material world.—I bow down to Gaura, the beautiful son of Mother Saci.

5) He motivates pure devotion unto Himself. He is most attractive to His beloved servitors. By His dramatic dancing He exhibits the characteristics of the King of paramours. He causes the minds of beautiful young village women to dance.—I bow down to Gaura, the beautiful son of Mother Saci.

6) He plays karatals as His throat emits sweet melodious sounds and the vibrant notes of the vina are softly played. He thus inspires the devotees to perform dramatic dancing that is infused with aspects of His own devotional service.—I bow down to Gaura, the beautiful son of Mother Saci.

7) He is accompanied by the sankirtana movement, which is the religious practice for the age of Kali. He is the son of Nanda Maharaja come again. He is the extraordinarily brilliant ornament of the earth. His preaching mood is suitably adapted to the cycle of birth and death. His consciousness is fixed in meditation on His own form of Krsna. He is always accompanied by His transcendental abode.—I bow to Gaura, the beautiful son of Mother Saci.

8) His eyes, the soles of His feet, and His clothing are reddish like the color that heralds the rising sun. As He utters His own names, His voice falters. He awakens a sweet flavor to life throughout the universe.—I bow down to Gaura, the beautiful son of Mother Saci.
