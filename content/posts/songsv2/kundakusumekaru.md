**LYRICS:**

(1)

kunda-kusume karu kabaraki bhāra

hṛdaye birājita motima hāra

(2)

candane caracita rucira kapūra

ańgahi ańga anańga bhari pūra

(3)

cāndanī rajanī ujorali gorī

hari abhisāra rabhasa-rase bhori

(4)

dhabala bibhūṣaṇa ambara dhara-i

dhabalima kaumudī mili tanu cala-i

(5)

hera-ite parijana locana bhula

rańga-putalī yena rasa māhā bula

(6)

pūrita manoratha gati anibāra

guru-kula-kaṇṭaka ki karaye pāra

(7)

mūrati śińgāra pirītimaya bhāṣa

milali nikuñje kahe gobinda-dāsa

**TRANSLATION**

1) Jasmine flowers are twined in her braids. A pearl necklace glistens on her chest.

2) Her limbs are gloriously anointed with camphor and sandal paste. Her limbs are flooded with amorous desires.

3) Her fair complexion is glorious in the moonlit night. Sipping the nectar of yearning to meet Krsna, she is overcome.

4) Her garments and ornaments are white. As she walks, her graceful form meets the white moonlight.

5) She blunders. She glances at her kinsmen's eyes. As a puppet dances on a stage, she dances the dance of tasting nectar pastimes.

6) Without stopping, she goes to fulfill her desire. How did she cross over the shore less ocean of thorns that were her elders?

  
7) Her words are filled with love for a person who is like Kamadeva personified. In the forest she meets Krsna. So says Govinda dasa.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is sung in Raga Dhanasri.
