**LYRICS:**

(1)

abanika majhe dekha dona bha-i

aparupa rupa goracanda nita-i

(2)

hena padma jini duhum mukha chata

tahe parakasala prema-ghata

(3)

ghana candane duhum anga bhari

bhuja-yuga tuli dohe bala hari

(4)

nama sankirtana karala prakasa

guna ga-oye brndabana dasa

**TRANSLATION**

1) Look at Lord Gauracandra and Lord Nitai, the two brothers who have descended to this earth, two brothers whose forms are wonderful and glorious!

2) The glory of Their faces defeats the lotus flowers. They are effulgent with the glory of ecstatic spiritual love.

3) Their limbs are anointed with sandal paste. Raising Their arms, They chant, "Hari!"

4) In this way They manifest the nama-sankirtana movement, the movement of chanting the holy names. Vrndavana dasa thus sings Their glories.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This is a song based on Raga Bhatiyara.
