**LYRICS:**

(1)

hari he

tomāra gambhīra mana  nāhi bujhe anya jana

sei mana anusāri saba

jagata-udbhāba-sthiti   pralaya-soḿsāra-gati

mukti ādi śaktira baibhaba

(2)

e saba baidika līlā  icchā-mātra prokāśilā

jībera bāsanā anusāre

tomāte bimukha ho'ye   mājila abidyā lo'ye

sei jība karma-pārābāre

(3)

punaḥ jadi bhakti kori'   bhaje bhakta-sańga dhori'

tabe pāya tomāra caraṇa

antarańga-līlā-rase      bhase māyā nā paraśe

bhaktibinodera phire mana

**TRANSLATION**

1) Oh, my Lord Hari! Your mind is extremely grave, and Your deep intentions cannot be understood by any other person, although all living beings are unconsciously following Your mind. The opulences of Your magnificent potencies produce the creation, maintenance and ultimate destruction of the material worlds, as well as provide for liberation from these temporary abodes.

2) These pastimes of creation, maintenance and destruction are all described in the Vedic scripture. And You have manifested it all according to Your own sweet will, in order to fulfill the materialistic desires of certain souls. When they become averse to You, they then become drowned in the darkest ignorance within the ocean of fruitive actions and reactions.

3) However, if one again revives his devotional service to You, and worships You in the association of Your devotees, then he can attain Your lotus feet. Thus Bhaktivinoda's mind has been changed back onto the path towards You by floating in the mellows of Your confidential pastimes, which maya is not able to touch.
