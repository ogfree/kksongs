**LYRICS:**

(1)

Glory to Sri Govindadeva whose feet

Are like two lotus flowers and whose waist

Is like a pond by lotus flowers embraced,

And whose navel is like a lotus flower sweet

(2)

With fragrance and whose dark broad glorious chest

Is like a lotus forest great and whose arms

Are like lotus stems and whose graceful neck is like charms

Made of lotus flowers and in whose fingers rest

(3)

A host of lotus petals and whose smile

Is the fragrance of lotus flowers and whose face

Is a million petal lotus flower with grace

And glory and divine sweet nectar while

(4)

His glistening restless playful smiling eyes

Are of blue lotus flowers the graceful prize.
