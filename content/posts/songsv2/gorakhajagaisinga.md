**LYRICS:**

(1)

go-rakha jāgāi śińgā-dhvani śuna-ite

jaṭilā bhikha āni dela

maunī yogeśvara mātha hilāyata

bujhala bhikha nāhi nela

(2)

jaṭilā kahata taba kāhā tuhu māgata

yogī kahata bujhāi

tere vadhū hāta bhikha hāma leyaba

turitahi deha pāṭhā

(3)

parivaratā vinu bhikha leu yaba

yogī barata hoye nāśa

tākara vacana śunite tanu pulakita

dhāi kahe vadhū-pāśa

(4)

dvāre yogī-vara parama manohara

jñānī bujhala anumāne

bahuta yatana kari ratana-thālī bhari

bhikha deha tachu ṭhāme

tuyā mukha-vacana eka cāi

nanda-nandana para yo abhimāna so

māpha karaha yāi

(8)

śuni dhanī rai cīre mukha jhāmpala

bhekha-dhārī naṭa-rāja

govinda-dāsa kaha naṭa-bara-śekhara

sādhi calata mana kāja

**TRANSLATION**

1) Hearing the sound of a buffalo-horn, the cowherd people awakened. Bringing some alms, Jatila, the mother of Abhimanyu, Radharani’s so-called husband, offered them to the beggar. Disguised as a beggar-yogi, Lord Krishna, the master of all yoga, was silent. He tilted His head. He would not accept the alms.

2) Jatila said: “What do You want, then?” The yogi said, “Your daughter-in-law should offer the alms with Her own hand. Only then will I accept them. Send for Her at once.”

3) “If I accept alms from you \[and not from Srimati Radharani\], then My yogi’s vow will perish.” Hearing these words, and the hairs of her body now standing erect, Jatila ran to the side of her daughter-in-law.

4) Jatila thought the supremely charming yogi at her door must be a great sage. With great effort she gathered up some offerings.

5) Hearing the commotion, beautiful Radha came. “I will go to the yogi,” she said. Jatila affirmed, “This yogi is not an ordinary man. Simply by seeing Him, one attains a great spiritual treasure.”

6) On the tray was an offering of whole-wheat flour and a golden cup with some ghee in it. Taking the tray in Her hands, sighing with love and Her life’s breath trembling, Radha brought the offering to the yogi Krishna.

7) The yogi Krishna said, “I will not accept this offering yet. First I wish to hear a single word from Your mouth. I am Nanda’s arrogant son. Say that You forgive Me, and then I will depart.”

8) Hearing these words, beautiful Radha covered Her face with Her cloth. Then Krishna, the king of dancers, took the alms. Govinda Das says: His heart’s mission accomplished, Lord Krishna, the crown jewel of all dancers, took His leave.
