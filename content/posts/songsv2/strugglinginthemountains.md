**LYRICS:**

(1)

Struggling in the mountains of worldly desires

Falling in the caves of lost consciousness

Stumbling through the darkness of pain and illusion

Burning through the desert of our own selfishness

(2)

Deep in the jungle of anger of envy

Coming through of swaps of casualness

Devoured by the fire of lust that surrounds us

Here is the mist devoid of happiness

(Refrain)

On and on and on and on,

We are trying to reach you, Lord.

Seeking a taste of your ocean of happiness

Reaching to the light that is breaking through the darkness

Trying to escape from the world of birth and death

(3)

Drowned by desires for profit and exclusion

Crowned by with thorns of adoration’s quest

Haunted by the ghost of merging in the oneness

Swallowed by the serpent of sleep and ignorance

(4)

Cooling the fires with rainfalls of mercy

Prabhupada has come to lead us back home

Dancing on the path of Nectar of Devotion

Seeds for love of Krsna in our hearts are sown
