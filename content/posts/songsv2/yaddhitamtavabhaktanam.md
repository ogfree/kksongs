3) One who has extended ears and a wide-open mouth, making enemies flee in fear, who does not possess any faults - Lord Narasimha, please destroy all enemies.

4) One who has pointed teeth, who has an effulgent chest like fire, who possesses ferocious nails, who has a shining tongue, Lord Narasimha - kill my enemies.
