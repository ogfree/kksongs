śrībāsera prati          caitanya-prasāda

dekhiyā sakala jana

jaya śrī-caitanya        jaya nityānanda

boli' nāce ghana ghana

**TRANSLATION**

1) Seeing Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu shows such favorable grace to Srivasa Pandita, all the devotees present there began to dance ecstatically, and they repeatedly shouted, "Jaya Sri Caitanya! Jaya Nityananda!" with resounding voices.

2) It is simply not possible to describe the ecstatic mood that arose in Srivasa's house at that time, indeed, it was just like a great war of transcendental emotions was taking place within the battlefield of tears of joy, all arising due to ecstatic love for Krsna.

3) Then the four brothers of the dead boy came over and fell down at Lord Caitanya's lotus feet and began weeping and wailing with piteous voices choked with ecstatic love. Then they began rolling on the ground, overflowing with pure love while humbly petitioning the Lord as follows.

4) They said, "Oh Lord of our lives! If calamities like this would happen every day, then that would only increase our deep loving attachment to Your lotus feet!"

5) "This calamity of losing our brother today is actually our great fortune, for on this day we are remembering Your Lordship. If, on some other day, we are bereft of Your remembrance, then that day is actually the real calamity for us, oh Lord."

6) Falling down at the feet of Srivasa Pandita's entire family, Bhaktivinoda thus narrates how their Lord Gaurasundara is bestowing His causeless mercy upon all distressed souls.
