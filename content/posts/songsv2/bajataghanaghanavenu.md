**LYRICS**

(Refrain)

bājata ghana ghana beṇu

hai hai rāba        hāmbā raba garajana

ānande magana carata saba dhenu

(1)

go-dhana sańge        rańge yadu-nandana

bihara-i yamunā-tīra

dāma śrīdāma        sudāma mahā-bala

gopa goyāla sańge bala-bīra

(2)

sama-baya-beśa        keśa parimaṇḍita

cūḍe śikhaṇḍaka kusuma ujora

maṇimaya hāra       guñjā naba mañjula

hera-ite jaga-jana-mana karu bhora

(3)

balaya nisāna         kanaka kaṭi kińkiṇī

nūpura ruṇu jhunu bāja

gobinda-dāsa pahu        niti niti aichana

bihara-i naba ghana bipina samāja

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) Again and again He plays the flute. Hai! Hai!", the boys call. "Hamba", the cows moo. Plunged in bliss, the cows walk and graze.

1) Surrounded by His cows, Lord Krsna enjoys pastimes on the Yamuna's banks. The powerful boy-hero Krsna is surrounded by Dama, Sridama, Sudama, and the boys and cows.

2) His friends are like Him in age and garments. His hair is decorated with flowers and a peacock-feather. He wears a jewel necklace and a graceful string of gunja. Gazing at Him, the people of the world feel their hearts overcome with bliss.

3) His bracelets, anklets, and golden belt jangle. Again and again Govinda dasa's master enjoys pastimes in this way with His friends in the newly-blossoming forest.

**Remarks/ Extra Information****:**

This song is to be sung in Raga Saranga.
