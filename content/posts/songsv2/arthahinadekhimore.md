(1)

artha hīna dekhi more cheḍeche sabaī

kuṭumba ātmīya ār bandhu-jana-bhāī

(2)

duḥkha hoy, hāsi pāya, ekā basi' hāsi

māyāra saḿsāra ei kāke bhālobāsi

kothā gela mātā pitā ār snehamoy

kothā gela jyeṣṭha yāńrā svajanādi hoy

(4)

tādera khabar kebā debe more bol

nāma mātra tā'der saḿsāra raye gela

**TRANSLATION**

1) Upon seeing me without material assets, everyone, including my family, near-ones, and brothers have left me!

2) Upon bearing such suffering, I get amused. Alone, I sit down and laugh. Who are my loved ones in the material world?

3) Where have my mother, father, and my beloved ones gone? Where did my elders and relatives go?

4) Who will give me news on them? Please tell me. Only thing remaining from them in this planet is their names.
