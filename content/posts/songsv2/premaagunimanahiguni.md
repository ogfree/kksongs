**LYRICS:**

(1)

prema āguni      mānahi guṇi guṇi

e dina-yāminī jāgi

madana-kuñjara      kuñje roya-i

tohari rasika lāgi

(2)

ki phala mānini       māna mānasi

kānu jānasi tori

tuhu se jaladhara        ańge śobhata

yaichana dāminī gorī

(3)

na-ola kiśalaya       balaya malayaja

pańka pańkaja-pāta

śayane chaṭaphaṭa        luṭha-i mahī\-tale

to bine daha-i gāta

(4)

jānaha puna puna      so piyā parīkhana

so-i pūje pāñca bāṇa

rāya campati        o rasa gāhaka

dāsa gobinda bāṇa

**TRANSLATION**

1) He burns in the flames of love. Thinking and thinking of Your proud jealous anger, He stays awake all day and all night. Although He is like Kamadeva's wild elephant, now He sits in the forest, thinks of You, and weeps.

2) O angry gopi, what fruit do You think will come from Your proud jealous anger? You know Krsna very well. His body is glorious like a dark monsoon cloud, and You are like a glistening lightning flash at His side.

3) He wears bracelets of new flower-buds. He is anointed with sandal-paste. He is adorned with lotuses. Now He is restless and cannot sleep. He rolls about on the ground. Without You, He feels His body is licked by fire.

4) Again and again You have tested Him and seen that He loves You dearly. To attain You, He now worships Kamadeva with offerings of campaka flowers. Govinda dasa sings this song of Lord Krsna's nectar pastimes.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is in Raga Bihaga.
