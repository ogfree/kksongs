**LYRICS:**

(1)

gaurāńga rasera nadī premera tarańga

uthaliyā yāiche dhārā kabhu nahe bhańga

(2)

abhirāma sārańga tāya taṭa dui-khāni

acyutānanda tāhe premera ghuraṇi

(3)

srota bahi yāya tāhe śrī-adwaita-candra

ḍubāri kāṇḍāri tāhe prabhu nityānanda

(4)

prema jalacara śrīvāsādi sahacara

swarūpa śrī-rūpa bhela premera makara

(5)

ṭhākuka ḍubibāra kāja paraśa nā pāiyā

duḥkhiyā śekhara kānde phukāra kariyā

**TRANSLATION**

1) From Lord Gauranga does a great river of nectar flow. The waves of that river are waves of ecstatic prema. That flooding river never stops flowing.

2) Abhiram Thakur and Saranga Thakur are that river’s two banks. Acyutananda is its whirlpool of ecstatic prema.

3) Sri Advaitachandra is that river’s current. Prabhu Nityananda is both the diver that swims in that river and the captain of the boat that plies its waters.

4) Srivas Thakur and his associates are the fish that swim in those waters of prema. Svarupa Goswami and Rupa Goswami are the sharks that swim in that river.

5) Alas, unable to swim in that river, the miserable Shekhar Das stays on the bank and loudly weeps.
