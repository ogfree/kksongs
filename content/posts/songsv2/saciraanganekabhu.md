(1)

bhāi-re!

śacīr ańgane kabhu,  mādhavendra-purī prabhu,

prasādānna korena bhojan

khāite khāite tā’ra,  āilo prema sudurbār,

bole, śuno sannyāsīra gaṇ

(2)

mocā-ghanṭa phula-baḍi,  dāli-dālnā-caccaḍi,

śacī-mātā korilo randhan

tā’ra śuddhā bhakti heri’,  bhojana korilo hari,

sudhā-sama e anna-byañjan

(3)

yoge yogī pāy jāhā,  bhoge āj ha’be tāhā,

\`hari’ boli’ khāo sabe bhāi

kṛṣṇaera prasād-anna,  tri-jagat kore dhanya,

tripurāri nāce jāhā pāi’

**TRANSLATION**

1) O brothers! Madhavendra Puri Prabhu sometimes honored prasad in the courtyard of Mother Saci. While eating and eating he would become overwhelmed by symptoms of ecstatic love of God. Once he addressed the renunciates who were accompanying him, "O assembled sannyasis! Just listen to this:

2) "Mother Saci has cooked many varieties of prasad, such as semi-solid delicacies made with banana flower, a special dahl preparation, baskets of fruits, small square cakes made of lentils and cooked-down milk, among others. Seeing her pure devotion, Lord Krsna personally ate all these preparations, which are just like nectar.

3) "O brothers! All the results that the mystic yogis obtain by the diligent practice of yoga will be obtained today by taking these remnants of the Lord. Everyone come and eat the prasad of Lord Hari and shout His holy name! The three worlds are made glorious by the presence of the food-grains left by Lord Krsna. Even Lord Tripurari (Lord Siva) dances in great joy on obtaining that prasad.”

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

Prasad at Mother Saci's is confirmed in the **[Caitanya-caritamrta, Madhya Lila Chapter 9 Verses 295 through 298](https://prabhupadabooks.com/cc/madhya/9?page=3&d=1)**.
