(Refrain)

hera-ite śyāmara-canda

kore āgori gorī-mukha mochata

basana ḍhulāyata manda

kahatahi gobinda-dāsa

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) I gazed at Him. He was like a dark moon. The doorway of His chest and the great bolts of His arms charm the most beautiful fair girls. His garments gently sway to and fro.

1) The dark circle of His face glistened in the sunlight. In drops of perspiration His tilaka marking ran. When He walked with delicate soft feet on the hot sandy pathway, I felt that I myself had burst into flames.

2) Betelnuts and camphor are on His lips. With sandal paste His limbs are anointed. Any graceful girl that touches His dark limbs will find herseelf tossed to and fro by waves of prema.

3) In a forest cottage He rests on a charming bed. Learned in all the scriptures, the buzzing bees chant His glories. Fair Radha and dark Krsna enjoy many blissful pastimes. So says Govinda dasa.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This is sung in Raga Todi.
