**TRANSLATION**

1) I offer my respectful obeisances to the prince of the gopas, who is more handsome than millions of Kamadevas, who is more splendid than a blossoming blue lotus, and whose pastimes enchant the entire world.

2) Let me offer my respectful obeisances to Lord Krsna, who wears a gunja necklace, who is splendid as a sapphire, and who is a regal elephant on the Yamuna's shore.

3) I offer my respectful obeisances to Balarama's younger brother, who is the reservoir of all transcendental bliss, who wears a garland of kadamba flowers, and who is attained by pure love.

4) O Lord whose shoulders are splendid with earrings, O Lord who gracefully places the flute to Your mouth, O swan who swims in the Manasa Lake of Radha's thoughts, O flower-crown of Vraja, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.

5) O Lord who wears a peacock-feather crown, O Lord whose hand is decorated with a staff, O Lord who wears flower earrings, O lotus-eyed Lord, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.

6) I offer my respectful obeisances to Lord Govinda, whose heart is pleased by the sweetness of the madhvika nectar of Radha's love, and who is more handsome than a host of Kamadevas. 

7) I offer my respectful obeisances to Lord Hari, who is decorated with the nectar of transcendental amorous pastimes, who wears karnikara earrings, and whose splendid luster makes one mistake Him for a host of new monsoon clouds.

8) I offer my respectful obeisances to the Lord, whose flute openly stole the jewels of the gopis' chastity, who wears a kahlara flower in His hair, and who broke the demon Sankhacuda.

9) I offer my respectful obeisances to the prince of the gopas, who is a bumblebee tasting the honey of the bandhuka flower of Radha's lips, and who is a lion against the elephants of the demons.                        

10) O Lord whose peacock feather is as charming as a rainbow, O Lord who enlivens the world, O dark cloud embraced by the lightning flash of Sri Radha, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.

11) O moon shining on the lotus flowers of the eyes of the gopis blinded by love, O Lord decorated with kunkuma tilaka, O Lord dressed in yellow garments, I offer my respectful obeisances to You.

12) I offer my respectful obeisances to the dear friend of Gokula, who is a cloud that extinguishes the blazing forest fire of Indra's pride, and who made the king of mountains into a toy ball.

13) Weighted down by the heavy boulder of my offenses, I am drowning in the ocean of pain. O merciful Lord Krsna, please be kind to me, a wicked, sinful man.

14) Although I am a mine of offenses, and although I cannot tell right from wrong, I still hope for Your mercy. O Lord Madhava, please be merciful to me.
