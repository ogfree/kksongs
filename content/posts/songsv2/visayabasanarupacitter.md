**LYRICS:**

(1)

visaya-basana rupa citter bikar

amar hrdoye bhoga ka're anibar

(2)

je kota jatana ami korilam hay

na gelo bikar, bujhi sese prana jay

(3)

e ghor bikar more korilo asthira

santi na pailo sthan, antara adhira

(4)

sri rupa goswami more krpa bitariya

uddharibe kabe jukta-bairagya arpiya

(5)

kabe sanatana more chadaye bisoy

nityanande samarpibe haiya sadoy

(6)

sri jiba goswami kabe siddhanta-salile

nivaibe tarkanala, citta jahe jwale

(7)

sri-caitanya-nama sune udibe pulaka

radha-krsnamrta-pane haibo asoka

(8)

kangaler sukangal durjana e jana

baisnaba-caransroy jace akincana

**TRANSLATION**

1) The delusion rooted deep into my heart has taken the shape of desires for sense gratification. Thus in my heart I am constantly trying to enjoy.

2) Alas! How much endeavor have I made for such enjoyment? My delusions have not gone away, and I understand that now in the end my life is departing.

3) This ghastly delusion has made me extremely restless. I have not achieved any peace, and I am most disturbed at heart.

4) When will Srila Rupa Gosvami bestow his mercy upon me? When will he deliver me by bestowing upon me yukta vairagya? (The science of renunciation which dovetails all favorable things in devotional service.)

5) When will Srila Sanatana Gosvami cause me to give up this materialistic sense gratification? Being gracious to me, he will offer me in devotion to Lord Nityananda Prabhu.

6) When will Srila Jiva Gosvami pour the waters of his strong conclusive truths and thereby extinguish the fire of false arguments that burns my heart?

7) My jubilation will arise when I hear the chanting of the holy name of Sri Krsna Caitanya, and by drinking the nectar of Radha-Krsna I will become free from all of my lamentations.

8) This rogue is not only wicked amongst the wicked, but is the most wretched amongst the wretched. Therefore he now begs for the shelter of the lotus feet of all the Vaisnavas.
