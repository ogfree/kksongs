**LYRICS:**

(Refrain)

rādhikā kṛṣṇa rādhikā

rādhikā tava virahe keśava

(1)  
stana-viniḥitam api hāram udāram

sa manute kṛśā-tanur iva bhāram

  
(2)

sarasa-masṛṇam api malayaja-pańkam

paśyāti viṣam iva vapuṣi saśańkam

(3)

śvasita-pavanam anupama-pariṇā;ham

madana-dahanam iva vahati sadāham

(4)

diśi diśi kirati sajala-kaṇa-jālam

nayana-nalinam iva vigalita-nālam

(5)

tyajati na pāni-talena kapolam

bāla-śaśinam iva sāyam alolam

(6)

nayana-viṣayam api kisalaya-talpaḿ

kalayati vihita-hutāśa-vikalpam

(7)

harir iti harir iti japati sakarṇam (hare kṛṣṇa hare kṛṣṇa)

viraha-vihita-maraṇeva nikāmaḿ

(8)

sri-jayadeva-bhaṇitam iti gītam

sukhayatu keśava-padam upanītam

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) Oh Radhika! O Krsna! O Radhika! There is separation without You, O Kesava!

1) Hey Kesava! In Your separation Radha has become very weak at heart, even the fine necklace that She wears feels burdensome.

2) Hey Kesava! In Your separation Radhika considers the candan paste used to cool Her bodily fever to be just like poison.

3) Hey Kesava! In Your separation Radhika has lost all calm nature. She breaths heavily as though Cupid’s arrow was blazing within Her heart.

4)  Hey Kesava! In Your separation Radhika appears as if a lucked lotus flower drenched in water. While crying pathetically She searches after You in every direction.

5)  Hey Kesava! In Your separation Radhika’s soft bed of leaf blossoms appears just like a bed of fire!

6)  Hey Kesava! In Your separation Radhika stares at the ground with Her hand placed over Her cheek. Thus Her pale face looks like the motionless half-moon at sunset.

7)  Hey Kesava! In Your separation Radhika will soon die. So to attain You in Her next life She feelingly cries: O Hari! O Hari! Hare Krsna!

8)  Let Sri Jayadeva’s song of Radhika’s separation for Kesava increase the bliss of those surrendered unto His lotus feet.
