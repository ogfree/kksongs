**LYRICS:**

(refrain)

mohe de daraśana giridhārī

torī sāńvarī surata pe maiń vārī

(1)

yamunā taṭ hari dhenu chaḍāve

madhura madhura svara veṇu bajāve

kāńdhe kamariyā kārī

(2)

mora mukuṭa pītāmbara sohe

dekha rūpa muni-jana mana mohe

kuṇḍala kī chavī nyārī

(3)

vṛndāvana meń rāsa racāve

gopa-gopīkā sańga mil gāve

nūpura kī dhun pyārī

**TRANSLATION**

Refrain: Please allow me to see You, Giridhari! I have given up myself to Your enchanting face!

1) On the banks of the Yamuna River, You tend the cows! You play very sweet melodies on Your flute! You have blanket draped over Your shoulder.

2) He is adorned with a crown with a peacock feather on His head and appears resplendent with His yellow cloth. This form of His attracts the minds of saintly persons. Your ear-rings dazzle in a splendorous way!

3) You sport and relish mellows in Vrndavana. The cowherd boys and girls accompany you and sing to Your loving melodies from Your ankle bells.
