**TRANSLATION**

1) O Rama, Who was constantly remembered by Hanuman, the best among the apemen! O Rama, Who destroyed the obstacles in His way! O Rama, Who is the sustainer of life of Sita! O Rama, Who the evil rogue, Ravana, made false statements about.

2) O Rama, Who was praised by the wise Hanuman! O Rama, Who was presented by Sita as (Her) protector from Jayanta disguised as a crow (the son of Indra)! O Rama, Who was shown the cudamani (hair-piece) of Sita (by Hanuman)! O Rama, Who was comforted by the words of Hanuman, the best Apeman!
