**LYRICS:**

(Refrain)

yata yata avatara sara

ghusite rahila amara gora abatara

(1)

brahmara durlabha krsna prema nama dhana

a-candale diya prabhu bharila bhubana

(2)

mleccha pasanda adi premera banyaya

dubiya sakala loka nace gana gaya

(3)

pasu-paksi-byaghra-maga-jalacara-gane

hase kande nace gaya karaye kirtane

(4)

swarga-martya-patala dubila saba grame

bancita ha-ila eka dasa balarame

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) He is the best of all avataras. This I say of my Lord Gaura-avatara.

1) The treasure of Lord Krsna’s holy name and love for Lord Krsna—a treasure even the demigod Brahma finds difficult to attain—Lord Gaura gives to everyone, even to the candalas. He fills the world with that treasure.

2) He plunges even the mlecchas, blapshemers, and others like them into a flood of the nectar of ecstatic spiritual love. He makes everyone in the world dance and sing.

3) He makes even the birds, beasts, tigers, deer, and fish dance, sing, laugh, and weep in kirtana.

4) He plunges the heavenly, middle, and lower worlds in the nectar of ecstatic love. Only Balarama dasa is not plunged. Only he is cheated.
