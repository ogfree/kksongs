**LYRICS:**

(1)

kāñcana-yūthī kusuma la-i gori

nirama-i mūrati yatana kari tori

(2)

tuyā anubhābe ālińga-i tāya

so tanu tāpe bhasama bha-i yāya

(3)

śuna śuna o bṛṣabhā;nu-kumārī

tuyā birahānale jwalata murāri

(4)

jhamara nīla-utpala-dala ańga

lore nā heraye nayana-tarańga

(5)

bigati muralī phurali rahu dūra

anukhaṇa madana dahana paripūra

(6)

bicharala piñcha mukuṭa paripāṭi

sahacare meli marata jī\-u kāṭi

(7)

jī\-u rahata aba tuyā rasa āśe

tohari caraṇe kahe gobinda-dāse

**TRANSLATION**

1) O beautiful fair girl, taking a golden yuthi flower, He carefully made a Deity of You.

2) Filled with love for You, He embraced that Deity, but the heat of His body turned that Deity into ashes.

3) Listen. Listen, O daughter of King Vrsabhanu. Krsna burns in many flames of separation from You.

4) His body graceful like blue lotus petals is overcome. His eyes now flooded with waves of tears, He cannot see.

5) He threw His flute far away. Moment after moment He drowns in the flames of Kamadeva's fire.

6) He forgets His peacock-feather crown. His friends gather around Him. Soon His life with be cut and He will die.

7) Before Your feet Govinda dasa says: The hope that again He will enjoy nectar pastimes with You is all that keeps Sri Krsna alive.
