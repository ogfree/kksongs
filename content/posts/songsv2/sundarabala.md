**LYRICS:**

(1)

sundara-bālā śacī-dulālā

nācata śrī-hari-kīrtana meń

bhāle candana tilaka manohara

alakā śobhe kapolana meń

(2)

śire cūḍā daraśi bāle

vana-phula-mālā hiyāpara dole

pahirana pīta-paṭāmbara śobhe

nūpura ruṇu-jhunu caraṇo meń

(3)

rādhā-kṛṣṇa eka tanu hai

nidhuvana-mājhe baḿśī bajāy

viśvarūpa ki prabhujī sahi

āota prakaṭahi nadīyā meń

(4)

koi gāyata hai rādhā-kṛṣṇa nām

koi gāyata hai hari-guṇa gān

mańgala-tāna mṛdańga rasāla

bājata hai koi rańgaṇa meń

**TRANSLATION**

1) This gorgeous boy is the darling child of mother Saci, dancing in the kirtana of chanting Lord Hari’s names. His forehead is adorned with drawings of sandalwood paste, and His enchanting locks of hair are shining in a splendorous fashion as they bounce upon His cheeks.

2) His hair is wrapped in a topknot, and a garland of forest flowers sways upon His chest. Wearing brilliant yellow silken garments, He dances with ankle bells tinkling upon His feet.

3) Sri Sri Radha and Krsna have become joined in one body, and together They play a flute within the grove of Nidhuvana. In this mood, the Lord of Visvarupa has come and manifested Himself in the town of Nadiya.

4) Someone in that kirtana sings the names of Radha and Krsna, someone else sings songs of Lord Hari’s transcendental qualities, while others play the auspicious rhythms of the sweet and relishable mrdanga drums. All this takes place in that spectacular performance.

**Remarks/ Extra Information****:**
