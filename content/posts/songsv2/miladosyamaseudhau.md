**LYRICS:**

(refrain)

milā do śyāma se udhau tere guṇa ham bhī gāeńge

(1)

gokula ko choḍa jab se gae vāpas nahīń āye

ḳhatā kyā ho gaī hama se araja apanī manāeńge

(2)

mukuṭa sira mora-pańkha kā, makara kuṇḍala hai kānoń meń

manohara rūpa mohana kā, dekha dil ko rijhāeńge

(3)

sneha lagākara ke bisārā nanda-nandana ne

caraṇa meń śīś dhara kara ke hama unako manāeńge

(4)

phir kabhī āye gokula meń hameń daraśana dilā denā

voh brahmānanda kahe dil se, nahīń unako bhulāeńge

**TRANSLATION**

Refrain: O Udhau, please introduce us to Syama! We will even sing your glories!

1) Ever since you have left Gokula, you have never returned back! What fault did we do? Please accept our humble plea!

2) He is adorned with a crown with a peacock feather on His head and wears earrings shaped like sharks on His ears. Looking at His ever-enchanting form excites our hearts!

3) After giving us love, the son of Nanda Maharaja abandons us! Let’s go and apply our heads to His lotus feet to beg and reason with Him!

4) If You ever plan on coming to Gokula, please appear before us! The poet Brahmananda says from his heart that he can never forget Him!

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This bhajan is popularized by Lokanath Swami in his album “Amrut Dhara.” It was rendered in Raga Kalavati in Kaherva Tala. It can also be rendered in Raga Yaman Kalyana.

There are some variations to this bhajan.

For Verse 1, “hama ko choḍ giradhārī, gae jaba se nahīń āye.” The meaning is “O Giridhari! Ever since You have left us, you have never returned back!”

For Verse 3, “prīta lāgakara” vs. “sneha lagakāra:” The meaning is still the same as the translation above.
