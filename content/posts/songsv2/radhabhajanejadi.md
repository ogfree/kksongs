**LYRICS:**

(1)

rādha-bhajane jadi mati nāhi bhelā

kṛṣṇa-bhajana tava akāraṇa gelā

(2)

ātapa-rohita sūraya nāhi jāni

rādhā-virahita mādhava nāhi māni

(3)

kevala mādhava pūjaye so ajñānī

rādhā anādara koro-i abhimānī

(4)

kabańhi nāhi korobi tāńkor sańga

citte icchasi jadi braja-rasa-rańga

(5)

rādhikā-dāsī jadi hoy abhimān

śīghra-i mila-i taba gokula-kān

(6)

brahmā, śiva, nārada, śruti, nārāyanī

rādhikā-pada-raja pūjaye māni’

(7)

umā, ramā, satyā, śacī, candrā, rukminī

rādha-avatāra sabe,—āmnāya-vānī

(8)

heno rādhā-paricaryā jāńkara dhan

bhakativinoda tā’r māgaye caraṇ

**TRANSLATION**

1) If your desire for the worship of Srimati Radharani does not come about, then your so-called worship of Krsna is completely useless.

2) Just as I never know the sun to be without sunlight, so I do not care to regard Madhava without Radha.

3) One who worships Madhava alone is imperfect in his knowledge, and one who disrespects Radha is simply conceited and proud.

4) You should never associate with such a person if you at all desire within your heart to participate in the eternal sportive pastimes of Vraja.

5) If one considers oneself to be a humble maidservant of Radhika, then such a person very quickly meets the Lord of Gokula.

6) Lord Brahma, Lord Siva, Narada Muni, the personified Vedas, and Laksmi-devi all honor and worship the dust of Radhika's lotus feet.

7) The Vedic scriptures declare that the goddesses Uma, Rama, Satya, Saci, Candra, and Rukmini are all personal expansions of Srimati Radharani.

8) Bhaktivinoda, whose only treasure is the service of such a Radha, humbly begs for Her lotus feet.
