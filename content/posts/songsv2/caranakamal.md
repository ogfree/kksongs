**LYRICS:**

(refrain)

caraṇa kamal bandauń hari rāī

(1)

jākī kṛpā pańgu giri lańghai

andhe koń saba kachu darasāī

(2)

bahiro sunai mūka puni bolai

rańka calai sira chatra dharāī

(3)

sūradāsa swāmī karunāmaya

bāra bāra bandauń tehi pāī

**TRANSLATION**

Refrain: I offer prayer unto the lotus feet of the worshipful Lord Hari.

1-2) By His mercy, a lame person crosses mountains, a blind person sees everything, a deaf person hears, a dumb person again speaks, and even a poor person walks with a servant holding an umbrella over his head.

3) The Lord of Sura Dasa is full of compassion. Therefore, I offer my obeisances unto His lotus feet, again and again.
