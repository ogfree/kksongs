(background)

Pastime Paradise! Pastime Paradise!

(1)

They've been spending most their lives

Living in a pastime paradise

They've been wasting most their time

Glorifying days long gone behind

They've been wasting most their days

In remembrance of ignorance oldest praise

Tell me who of them will come to be

How many of them are you and me

(2)

Dissipation Race Relations

Consolation Segregation

Dispensation Isolation

Exploitation Mutilation

Mutations Miscreation

(3)

Confirmation......to the evils of the world

They've been spending most their lives

Living in a future paradise

They've been looking in their minds

For the days that sorrow's gone from time

They keep telling of the day

When the Savior of love will come to stay

Tell me who of them will come to be

How many of them are you and me

Proclamation of Race Relations Consolations

Integration Verification of Revelations

Acclamation World Salvation

Vibrations Stimulation

(4)

Confirmation......to the peace of the world

They've been spending most their lives

Living in a pastime paradise

They've been spending most their lives

Living in a future paradise

We've been spending too much of our lives

Living in a pastime paradise

Let's start living our lives

Living for the future paradise

Praise to our lives

Living for the future paradise

Shame to anyone lives

Living in a pastime paradise

In “**[Chant and Be Happy](http://www.harekrishna.com/col/books/YM/cbh/)**” where Mukunda Goswami and George Harrison have a conversation about Harinama in Chapter 2, Harrison makes a reference to Stevie Wonder’s “Pastime Paradise” and the chanting of Hare Krsna that takes place. The RKC radio archives from Italy included this song in their song database. This song was recorded and released in 1976.
