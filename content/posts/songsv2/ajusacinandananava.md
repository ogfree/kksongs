**LYRICS:**

(1)

āju śacī-nandana naba abhiṣeka

ānanda-kanda nayana bhari dekha

(2)

nityānanda adwaita mili rańge

gā-ota unamata bhakatahiḿ sańge

(3)

hera-ite nirupama kāñcana-deha

barikhaye sabahu nayana ghana-mehā

(4)

puna puna nirakhite gora-mukha-indu

uchalala prema-sudha-rasa-sindhu

(5)

jaga bhari pūrala prema-tarańge

bañcita gobinda-dāsa parasańge

**TRANSLATION**

1)  Look! Now is the abhiseka ceremony of Saci's son, the root of all bliss.

2) Gathering around Lord Nityananda and Lord Advaita, and now wild with bliss, the devotees sing.

3) Gazing at the Lord's peerless golden form, the devotees shower tears from the rain clouds of their eyes.

4) Again and again gazing at the fair moon of Lord Gaura's face, the devotees are plunged into a flooding ocean of spiritual love.

5) The whole world is now flooded by waves of spiritual love. Only Govinda dasa is not touched by those waves. Only he is cheated of their touch.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is sung in Raga Bhairavi.
