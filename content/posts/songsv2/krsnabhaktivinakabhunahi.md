kṛṣṇa-bhakti vinā kabhu nāhi phalodoy

miche sab dharmādharma jīver upādhimoy

nānā-kāṇḍa-rūpe jīver bandhana-kāraṇa hoy

vinoder vākya dharo, nānā kānḍa tyāg koro,

nirupādhi kṛṣṇa-preme hṛdoye deho āśroy

**TRANSLATION**

1) There is no profit in a life devoid of devotional service to Krsna. Therefore all the so-called religiosity and irreligiosity of a living being who is bewildered by false worldly designations is simply useless.

2) Mysticism, performance of Vedic sacrifices, severe austerities, meditation, renunciation of the world, and cultivating knowledge of the impersonal Brahman-although appearing in the forms of various spiritual paths-are all causes of the soul's further bondage to this world.

3) Please heed this advice of Bhaktivinoda: Give up all these various paths, and just keep pure love of Krsna sheltered within your heart, for this alone is transcendental to all mundane designations.
