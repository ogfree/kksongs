**TRANSLATION**

1) O Krsna, thus imitating the pastimes of a helpless human child, charmingly kicking Your legs performing other pastimes, You were observed by the gopis.

2) O Krsna, pulling the tail of a calf, You would in turn be dragged about by him. The cowherd men and women would then forget all their other activites and become delighted by these childhood pastimes

3) O Krsna, in this way You would greatly perpleø Your mother, who was intent on performing her household duties. O Lord, Your great charm enchants Lord Brahma and the other demigods and the beauty of Your childhood amazes the entire universe. (All glories unto You).
