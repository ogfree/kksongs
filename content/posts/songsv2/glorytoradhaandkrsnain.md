**LYRICS:**

(1)

Glory to Radha and Krsna in Vrndavana

Equally to Govinda Gopinatha and Madana mohana.

Syamakunda Radhakunda hilly Govardhana

Kalindi Jamuna river and forest Mahavana.

(2)

Kesighata Bansibata and dozens of garden

The places of pastimes by Nanda's son

Glory to Nanda Yasoda and cowherdsmen

Sridama and friends who follow amen.

(3)

Glory to Vrisabhanu his wife beautiful

Glory to the full moon and the town of bull.

Glory to Gopisvara at Vrndavana fixed

Glory to the Brahmin who Krsna mixed.

(4)

Glory to Ramaghata and Rohini's son

Glory to all who reside Vrndavana.

Glory to the Brahmin's wife and mermaid

Who in devotional service respects paid.

(5)

Glory to the arena where dance performed

Radha and Syama who bumper stormed.

Glory to the zest of excellent mellow.

Paramorous feeling in-trance of kilo.

(6)

It's Krsnadasa poet who chants

Lotus feet of Jahnava he remembers.
