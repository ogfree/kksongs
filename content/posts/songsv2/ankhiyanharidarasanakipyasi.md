**LYRICS:**

(refrain)

ańkhiyāń hari darasana kī pyāsī

(1)

dekhyo cāhata kamala-nayana ko

nisa dina rahata udāsī

(2)

kesara tilaka motina kī mālā

vṛndāvana ke vāsī

(3)

neha lagāya tyāgi gaye tṛna sama

ḍāra gae gara phāńsi

(4)

kāhu ke mana kī kou kā jāne

logana ke mana hāńsī

(5)

suradāsa prabhu tumhare darasa bina

laihaun karavaṭa kāsī

**TRANSLATION**

Refrain: Our eyes thirst for a vision of Lord Hari.

1) They long to see the Lotus-eyed One, grieving for Him day and night.

2-3) Wearing a saffron tilaka and a garland of pearls and dwelling in the village of Vrndavana, He gave us His love, and then He casts us aside like a blade of grass, throwing a noose around our necks.

4) Nobody knows the pain in another’s breast, there is laughter in people’s hearts.

5) But Oh Lord of Sura Dasa! Without a vision of You, we would give up our very lives.

**Remarks/ Extra Information****:**

At the ISKCON New Jersey temple on Gaura Purnima 2002, an Odissi dancer sang this song. Therefore, I have decided to include this song in this song-book. It was rendered in Raga Kafi in Sitarkhani Tala.
