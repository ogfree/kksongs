**LYRICS:**

(1)

hari he

abibeka rūpa ghana   tāhe dhik ācchādana

hoilo ta'te andhakāra ghora

tāhe duḥkha-bṛṣṭi hoya   dekhi' cāri\-dike bhoya

patha-bhrama hoiyāche mora

(2)

nija abibeka doṣe   poḍi' durdinera roṣe

prāṇa jāya soḿsāra-kāntāre

patha-pradarśaka nāi  e durdaibe mārā jāi

ḍāki tāi acyuta tomāre

(3)

eka-bāra kṛpā-dṛṣṭi  koro āmā prati bṛṣṭi

tabe mora ghucibe durdina

bibeka sabala ha'be   bhaktibinoda tabe

dekhaibe patha samīcīna

**TRANSLATION**

1) Oh my Lord Hari! Ignorance of You is just like a menacing raincloud which hovers overhead and covers all directions, causing the darkness of spiritual blindness to envelop me. From this cloud of ignorance falls the rains of material tribulations which strikes fear throughout the four directions. Thus I have become lost and confused in this darkness, and I am absolutely unable to find the right path back to You, dear Lord

2) By my own fault of whimsical behavior, independent of You, I have become very angry at my fate of falling into the foul weather of this most difficult time of distress. And my life is leaving me while I am thus stranded within this material world, which is just like a dark forest in which one cannot properly find his way. I have no guide to show me the way out of here, and by this misfortune I am dying a slow death. Therefore I now call out to You, Acyuta, oh supremely infallible Lord!

3) If You would just shower the rain of Your kind glance moist with causeless mercy in my direction just once, oh Lord, then that glance would instantly terminate this period of great distress for me. Then my understanding of Your spiritual reality will become fixed-up, and then this Bhaktivinoda will be able to properly see the path which leads back to You.
