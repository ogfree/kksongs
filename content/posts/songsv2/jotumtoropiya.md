**LYRICS:**

(refrain)

jo tum toro piyā maiń nā hī torūṇ re

toso prīta tore kṛṣṇa kauna sańga jorūṇ re

(1)

tum bhae taruvara maiń bhaī pańkhiyā

tum bhae sarovara maiń bhaī machiyā

tum bhae girivara maiń bhaī cārā

tum bhaye candā maiń bhaī cakorā

(2)

tum bhae motī prabhu ham bhaye dhāgā

tum bhae sonā ham bhaye suhāgā

mīrā ke prabhu bṛja ke bāsī

tuma mere ṭhākura maiń terī dāsī

**TRANSLATION**

Refrain: Even though You have broken this bond, I will not break this bond. If I break my bond of love to You, Krsna, who else can I form this bond with?

1) You are the great tree and I am the bird. You are the lake and I am the fish. You are the mountain and I am the stream. You are the moon and I am the cakora bird that stares at the moon.

2) You are the pearl and I am the thread. You are the gold and I am the benefit. Mira’s Lord is a resident of Vraja. You are my Lord and I am Your maidservant.
