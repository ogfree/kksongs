**LYRICS**

(refrain)

jaya jaya rādhājī go! śaraṇa tohāri

aichana āroti jao bolihāri!

(1)

paṭṭa paṭṭāmbara ore nīla sārī

sińthi pore sindūra aruṇa ujori

(2)

beśa banāyala priya sahacari

ratana simhāsane baiṭhali gaurī

(3)

ratana jarita moni mānikya moti

jhalamala ābharaṇa prati ańga jyoti

(4)

cuwa candana gandha dehi braja bālā

vṛṣabhānu rāj nandinī vadana ujālā

(5)

caudike sakhī-gaṇa dehi koratāli

āroti koratahi lalitā piyāri

(6)

nava nava vrajavadhū mańgala gāoe

priya narma sakhī-gaṇa cāmara ḍhulāoe

(7)

rādhā pāda pańkaja bhakatahi āśā

dāsa manohara koroto bharasā

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) All glories to the shelter of the lotus feet of Radha! All glories to such an arati\-ceremony!

1) Radha wears a blue silken sari and veil, and She has splendid red powder on Her part (as worn by married girls in India).

2) Her dear maidservants help Her in arranging Her dress. Gauri (golden-complexioned Radha) sits on a jeweled throne.

3) Each of Her limbs is illuminated by glistening ornaments of jewels and pearls.

4) The gopis of Vraja are anointing Her body with fragrant sandalwood pulp. The face of king Vrsabhanu’s daughter shines splendidly.

5) On all sides Her girlfriends are blissfully clapping their hands. Radha’s dear girlfriend Lalita performs the arati\-ceremony.

6) The young married girls of Vraja are singing auspicious songs. And the best girlfriends of Radha fan Her with whisks.

7) Manohara Das desires the service of Radha’s lotus feet.
