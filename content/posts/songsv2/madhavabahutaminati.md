**LYRICS:**

(1)

mādhava, bahuta minati kari toya

dei tulasī tila, deha samarpinu,

dayā jāni nā chāḍabi moya

(2)

gaṇaite doṣa, guṇaleśa nā pāobi,

yab tuhuñ karabi vicāra

tuhuñ jagannāth, jagate kahāosi

jag-bāhira nahi muñi chāra

(3)

kiye mānuṣa paśu pakhī ye janamiye,

athavā kīṭa patañge

karam vipāke, gatāgati punaḥ punaḥ

mati rahu tuyā parasañge

(4)

bhaṇaye vidyāpati, atiśaya kātara,

taraite iha bhava-sindhu

tuyā pada-pallava, kari avalamban,

tila eka deha dīna-bandhu

**TRANSLATION**

1) O Madhava, with this offering of a tulasi leaf and sesame seeds I beseech You and pledge my body in Your service. I know Your compassion is such that You will not reject me.

2) While considering this appeal, You will only be able to count my faults. You will not find even a trace of good qualities in me. You are known throughout the creation as Jagannatha (master of the universe). Therefore do I, a worthless soul living within this universe, not have the right to accept You as my master?

3) Birth after birth, as a result of my karma, I repeatedly come and go, sometimes as a human, sometimes as an animal and sometimes as a bird, worm or insect. But in whatever birth I take may my mind always remain fixed on Your narrations.

4) With great remorse, the poet Vidyapati humbly prays, “O Madhava, O friend of the fallen, please give this insignificant person shelter at the tender leaf of Your lotus feet. In this way, I may cross over this ocean of material existence.”
