**LYRICS**

(1)

(oḿ) jaya rādhā rāsabihārī śrī rādhā rāsabihārī

kaṣṭa haraṇa mańgalamaya daraśana sukha-kāri

(oḿ) jaya rādhā rāsabihārī

(2)

caraṇa kamala meń jāūń simaraṇ karūń terā

bhakti sudhā barsāwo har lo duḥkha merā

(3)

nāma su pāvana terā mil gāye sāre

nāca nāca tere dvāre sudha budha sab hāre

(4)

rāsa racāwo prema jagāwo mana vṛndāvana meń

nirmala jñāna jagāwo hṛdaya āńgana meń

(5)

kānana kuṇḍala gala vana mālā śīṣa mukuṭa sohe

śyāmala rādhā joḍī bhaktana mana mohe

(6)

niśadin kīrtana gāwe āratī kare terī

rādhā rāsa-bihārī kāṭo bhava pheri

(7)

śrīla prabhupāda kṛpā se tyāgi saḿsāri

śarana paḍe satguru kī caraṇana balīhāri

**TRANSLATION**

1) Glories! All Glories to Sri Sri Radha Rasa-bihari! Oh Destroyer of troubles, and Deliverer of Auspiciousness, those who see You will get happiness!

2) I will always remember Your lotus feet. Please shower me with pure bhakti and destroy all of my distress.

3) By receiving Your holy name, I have received everything. I dance and dance at Your gateway renouncing all attachments.

4) Please awaken my love, and take my mind to Vrndavana where you can perform the rasa lila. Please awaken my heart and fill it with pure knowledge.

5) In the forest with earrings, with a flower garland, with a crown adorned on His head, Radha and Syama, The Divine Couple, makes the devotee’s mind go ecstatic.

6) I will always sing kirtana and perform arati for Your pleasure. All Glories to Sri Sri Radha Rasa-bihari, the destroyer of the ocean of nescience.

7) By the mercy of Srila Prabhupada, I have given up materialism. I offer all and surrender to the Lotus Feet of my true spiritual master, Srila Prabhupada.
