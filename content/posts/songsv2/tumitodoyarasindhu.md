**LYRICS:**

(1)

tumi to dayāra sindhu, adhama janāra bandhu,

mohe prabho! koro avadhāna

poḍinu asat bhole, kāma timińgile gile,

ohe nātha! koro paritrāṇa!

(2)

yāvat janama mora, aparādhe hoinu bhora,

niṣkapaṭe nā bhajinu tomā

tathāpi tumi se gati, nā chāḍiho prāṇapati

āmā sama nāhika adhamā

(3)

patita pāvana nāma, ghoṣaṇā tomāra śyāma,

upekhile nāhi mora gati

yadi hoi aparādhī, tathāpiho tumi gati,

satya satya yeno satī pati

(4)

tumi to parama devā, nāhi more upekhibā,

śuno śuno parāṇera īśvara

yadi kori aparādha, tathāpiho tumi nātha,

sevā diye koro anucara

(5)

kāma mora hoto citta, nāhi māne nija hita,

manera nā ghuce durvāsanā

more nātha ańgīkuru, ohe vāñchā kalpataru

karuṇā dekhuka sarva janā

(6)

mo sama patita nāi, tribhuvane dekho cāi,

narottama pāvana nāma dhara

ghuṣuka saḿsāre nāma, patita pāvana śyāma,

nija dāsa koro giridhara!

(7)

narottama boḍo duḥkhī, nātha! more koro sukhī,

tomāra bhajana sańkīrtane

antarāya nāhi yāy, ei to parama bhaya,

nivedana kori anukṣaṇa

**TRANSLATION**

1) O Lord, You are an ocean of mercy.  You are the friend of the fallen souls. Please notice me.  I have become like a non devotee, swallowed by the timingila fish of lust.  O Lord, please protect me.

2) In every birth I repeatedly offended You.  In every birth I failed to worship You sincerely. No one is as fallen as I.  Nevertheless, You are the only goal of my life.  O Lord of my life, please do not abandon me.

3) O Lord, You are known as Patita-pavana, the deliverer of the fallen, and You are also known as Syamasundara.  Please do not ignore my appeal.  Even if I am an offender, I think that You are the real goal of life.  That is the truth.

4) O Supreme Personality of Godhead, please do not neglect me.  O master of my life, please hear my words.  Even if I have committed offences to You, I always think of You as my master.  Please allow me to serve You as Your associate and follower.

5) Lust has destroyed my mind.  I do not know what is actually beneficial for me.  O Lord, You glance mercifully on all living entities and You are like a desire tree fulfilling the desires of everyone.  Please accept me as Your servant.

6) O Lord, You will not see anyone in these three planetary systems who is as fallen as I.  O Lord, please accept the name "Narottama-pavana" (the deliverer of Narottama), and let that name be broadcast throughout the material world.  O Lord Syamasundara, O lifter of Govardhana Hill, O deliverer of the fallen, please accept me as Your servant.

7) Narottama dasa is very unhappy.  O Lord please engage him in Your sankirtana movement and thus make him happy.  O Lord, I am very afraid that I will not be able to overcome the many obstacles that stop me from advancing in devotional service.  O Lord, at every moment I beg You to remove all those obstacles.
