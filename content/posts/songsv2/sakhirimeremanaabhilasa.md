**LYRICS:**

(refrain)

sakhī rī mere mana abhilāṣā hoya madana mohana ke guṇa gāū

(1)

śiśa pe mora mukuṭa sohe, pagana paijaniyā mana mohe

kamara pitāmbara jhilamila hoya na mukha se varṇana kara pāū

(2)

kānana me kuṇḍala hai ālā, gale me vaijantī mālā

adhara muralī pyārī lāge moya, sunū to mana me sukha pāū

(3)

ye laṭa mukha pe kālī-kālī cāla mohana kī matavālī

yahā jāye se darśana hoya batādo gela kahā jāū

(4)

ye naṭavara rāsa bihārī ke sańga vṛṣabhānu dulārī ke

saphala mero jīvana kaise hoya yugala caraṇana me sira nāū

**TRANSLATION**

Refrain: O sakhi, my heart’s desire is to sing the glories of Madana-mohana

1) The peacock feather in His crown is very beautiful His jingling anklebells are enchanting my mind. His waist is adorned with yellow cloth; the beauty of which I simply cannot describe.

2) Hearing about the earrings in His ears the garland of vaijayanti flowers around His neck and the beloved flute at His lips my heart will obtain great happiness.

3) Locks of black hair dangle upon His face As if intoxicated He moves in an enchanting fashion Tell me friend, where can I go to receive His darsana?

4) That best of dancers is in the company of the daughter of King Vrsabhanu

Bowing my head at the feet of the Divine couple, my life will be completely successful.
