**LYRICS:**

(1)

My dear Lord Krsna You are so kind upon this useless soul

but I do not know why You have brought me here.

Now You can do with me whatever You like.

(2)

But I guess You’ve got some business here

Since You brought me to this terrible place

Most of the people in ignorance and I don’t know

How they’ll understand Your message Divine.

(3)

But I know Your mercy can do anything

You’re the most expert mystic of all

Therefore, I’m praying for Your mercy so that I

Can convince them of Your message sublime.

(Refrain)

O Lord, I’m just a puppet in Your hands

and You brought me here to dance

Make me dance, make me dance, O Lord make me dance.

Make dance me, dance as you like

Dance, dance, dance, dance as you like

(4)

Everyone has fallen into Maya by Your will

So by Your will they can also be free

If You so desire, You may deliver them

And they will understand Your words.

(5)

I am the most fallen, so I am seeking Your Grace

So that I can convince them of Your words

Somehow, You brought me here to speak about You

Help make me a success or failure as You like.

(6)

You are the Lord of all souls, if You like

You can make my speaking suitable

Have no knowledge or any love

But You can fulfill the meaning of my name
