**LYRICS:**

(Refrain)

pirīti mūrati adhidebā

yākara daraśane          saba dukha miṭala

so-i āpane kara sebā

(1)

ādare āgu\-sari         rā-i hṛdaye dhari

jānu upare puna rākhi

nija kara-kamale         nayana-yuga mucha-i

hera-i cira thira āńkhi

(2)

himakara śītala       nīrahi titala

kara\-tale maja-i mukha

sa-jala nalinī\-dale      mṛdu mṛdu bīja-i

pucha-i pantha ki dukha

(3)

ańguli cibuka dhari        badane tāmbula pūri

madhura sambhāṣa-i kāna

gobinda-dāsa bhaṇa       niti naba nūtana

rā-ika amiya sināna

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) He who is the Deity of love, who is love personified, gazes at Her. Now all Her sufferings are ended. He personally serves Her.

1) Respectfully He approaches. He embraces Radha. He holds Her to His chest. With unblinking eyes He gazes at Her for a long time. With His lotus hands He rubs His eyes.

2) Even though She stays in the cooling moonlight, She perspires. With the palms of His hand He wipes Her face. With a moistened lotus-petal He gently gently fans Her. "Was there trouble on the path?", He asks.

3) Holding Her chin with a finger, He places betelnuts in Her mouth. Krsna speaks sweetly. Govinda dasa says: Radha feels She is being bathed in nectar that is eternally newer and newer.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is sung in Raga Tilak Kamoda.
