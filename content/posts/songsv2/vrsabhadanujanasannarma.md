**TRANSLATION**

1) May very fragrant Radha'-kunda, which, prodded by the gopis' many joking words after Vrsabhasura's death, the king of Vrndavana forest happily built and filled with His own hand, be my shelter.

2) May very dear and fragrant Radha-kunda, which, for one who bathes in it immediately creates in the land of the heart a desire tree of pure love rare even among the gopi beloveds of Lord Krsna in Vraja, be my shelter.

3) May very dear and fragrant Radha-kunda, where, yearning to attain the merciful sidelong glance of His queen, Lord Krsna diligently follows Her bathing attendants, be my shelter.

4) May very fragrant Radha'-kunda, which is named after a girl who is a realm of love for He who is the moon of Vraja, a girl who is like the most precious jewel in the crown of the sweet girls of Vraja, be my shelter.

5) The mercy obtained by serving Radha'-kunda makes the celestial vine of pure love for the prince of Vraja, which is famous for bearing the flowers of service to my queen, sprout. May that very fragrant Radha'-kunda be my shelter.

6) May very fragrant Radha-kunda, on the shores of which are many splendid and charming forest groves filled with the sweet sounds of bumblebees and each named after one of Sri Radha's friends, be my shelter.

7) May very fragrant Radha-kunda, on the shore of which, in a pleasant courtyard Queen Radha and Her friends sweetly joke with Lord Krsna, the moon of Vraja, be my shelter.

8) May very fragrant Radha-kunda, where the passionate divine couple daily plays with Their passionate friends in the charming lotus-scented water, be my shelter.

9) To one who is completely dedicated to Queen Radha's service and who happily reads these eight beautiful verses describing Her lake, even in this present body Lord Krsna shows His beloved as he happily embraces Her.
