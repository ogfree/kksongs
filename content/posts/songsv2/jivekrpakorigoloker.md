**LYRICS**

(1)

jibe krpa kori',goloker hari,

braja-bhava prakasilo

se bhava-rasajna,brndabana-jogya,

jada-buddhi na hoilo

(2)

krsna-lila-samudra apar

baikuntha-bihar,samana ihar,

kabhu nahe ja'na sar

(3)

krsna akar nar,sarva-rasadhar,

srngarer bisesatah

baikuntha-sadhaka,sakhye aparaka,

madhure na hoy rata

(4)

braje krsna-dhana,nabina-madana,

aprakrta rasamoy

jiber sahita,nitya-lilocita,

krsna-guna-gana hoy

**TRANSLATION**

1) Showing His causeless mercy to the fallen souls, the Lord of Goloka has revealed the moods and sentiments of Vraja. He who is the knower of the mellows of such loving exchanges of Vraja is fit to enter Vrndavana, as long as he does not maintain materialistic misconceptions.

2) The pastimes of Krsna are like an unfathomable ocean. All of the activities in Vaikuntha can never be compared to the sweet essence of Krsna's pastimes in Goloka.

3) Krsna's pastimes in the form of a two-armed human being are the reservoir of all transcendental mellows -- especially the conjugal mellow. The devotee who is following the rules and regulations of Vaikuntha develops only up to the mellow of fraternity, and is in comparison completely unable to taste any such sweetness as is found in the conjugal relationship.

4) Krsna in Vraja is just like an ever-fresh youthful Cupid, abounding in all transcendental ecstatic mellows. He always performs suitable pastimes with the different jiva souls. Thus some of the multitude of Krsna’s virtuous qualities is mentioned.
