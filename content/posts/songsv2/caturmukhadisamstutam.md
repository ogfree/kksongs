**TRANSLATION**

1) To the One who is worshipped by the four-faced Brahma and other demigods, worshipped by the people of the mode of goodness, Who is accompanied by the Halayudha (the bearer of the plough, Balarama) and others, I offer my obeisances to Lord of Sri Radhika.

2) To the One who killed many demons like Bakasura (the crane demon), the caretaker of the cowherd boys and girls, Who has enchanting black hair, I offer my obeisances to Lord of Sri Radhika.

3) To the One who destroyed the false pride of the king of demigods (Indra), the One who destroyed the illusion of Viranci (Lord Brahma), who pleases the damsels of Vraja, I offer my obeisances to Lord of Sri Radhika.

4) To the One who bears the peacock feather, the One who broke the tusks of an elephant (Kuvalayapida), relieved the suffering of the public by punishing King Kamsa, I offer my obeisances to Lord of Sri Radhika.

5) To the One who returned the child of the brahmana (Sandipani Muni), who removed the poverty that Sudama had, who stole the tree of the demigods, I offer my obeisances to Lord of Sri Radhika.

6) To the One who made Dhananjaya (Arjuna) victorious, the one who brought defeat to the great army, the One who removed the pitiful state of the Grandsire Bhisma, I offer my obeisances to Lord of Sri Radhika.

7) The One who was the cause of the curse by the brahmana (Durvasa Muni) that destroyed the entire Vraja dynasty, thus removing the burden from the Earth, I offer my obeisances to Lord of Sri Radhika.

8) To the One who rested and reclined on the banyan tree, Who liberated the hunter (Jara) who pierced His foot, Who returned back to His mystical abode, I offer my obeisances to Lord of Sri Radhika.

9) Thus, the eight prayers glorifying the Lord of Sri Radhika (Varastakam) is equally beneficial to all, and will deliver happiness to all. It will quickly free one from the material word to the one who chants this.
