**LYRICS:**

(1)

pīriti sac-cid-ānande rūpavatī nārī

dayā-dharma-ādi guna alańkāra sab tāhāri

(2)

jñāna tā’r paṭṭa-śāṭī, yoga-gandha-paripāṭī

e sabe śobhitā satī kore kṛṣṇa-mana curi

(3)

rūpa vinā alańkāre, kibā śobhā e-saḿsāre

pīriti-vihīna gune kṛṣṇae nā tuṣite pāri

(4)

vānarīra alańkāra, śobhā nāhi hoy tā’ra

kṛṣṇa-prem vinā tathā gune nā ādara kori

**TRANSLATION**  
1) Love and affection for the nature of eternity, knowledge, and bliss is like a very beautiful woman whose ornaments are all the good qualities headed by mercifulness and religiosity.

2) The divine wisdom of pure jnana is her silken sari, and the practice of the yoga of devotional service is her excellent bodily fragrance. Adorned by these qualities, that beautiful and chaste woman steals away the mind of Krsna Himself.

3) lf ornaments are worn by one completely devoid of beauty, then is such a person considered to be beautiful in this world? Similarly, one possessing good qualities like mercifulness and religiosity is unable to satisfy Lord Krsna if devoid of love for Him.

4) Just as there is no beauty to an ornament worn on the body of a female monkey, in the same way I do not hold in very high esteem qualities such as mercifulness and religiosity if they are devoid of love for Krsna.
