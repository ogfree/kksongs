**LYRICS:**

(Refrain)

mādhaba dhairaya nā kara gamane

tohāri biraha dhanī      antara jarajara

mānasa milana śamane

(1)

dhūli-dhūsara dhanī        dhairaya nā dhara

dharaṇī śūtala bharame

mukata kabarī-bhāra      hāra teyāgala

tāpita bhūṣita parāṇe

(2)

bigalita ambara       sambara nahe dhanī

sura-sutā srabe nayāne

kamalaja kamale-i        kamalaja jhāmpala

so-i nayana bara bayāne

(3)

mā bola-i dhanī       dharaṇī\-tale mūrachani

prāṇa prabodha nā māne

kaha-i caturā dhanī      āra kiye hoya jāni

gobinda-dāsa paramāṇe

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) O Krsna, You do not go to her and make her peaceful. Separated from You, a beautiful girl feels her heart is now overcome. Now her heart is on the verge of death.

1) Now that girl is covered with dust. She is not peaceful. She lies on the ground. She removes her necklace. She unties her braids. Now her life's breath is decorated with flames.

2) Her garments are in disarray. She has lost all restraint. A Yamuna of tears flows from her eyes. Her beautiful eyes are like lotus whorls in the lotus of her face.

3) She speaks not a word. On the ground she has fallen unconscious. I do not think her life's breath is still awake. An intelligent girl speaks some words to her. What will happen now? Govinda dasa is the witness of all this.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is in Raga Baradi.
