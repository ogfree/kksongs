**LYRICS:**

(1)

pativrata laksmi-devi pati-gata prana

anande sacira seva karaya vidhana

(2)

devatara sajja kare gaha sammarjana

dhupa dipa naibedyadi malya-candana

(3)

saba samskari deya devatara ghare

bahura silpataya saci apana pasara

(4)

e-i-rupe ache saci laksmira sahite

daiba niyojita karma na haya khandite

(5)

gauranga-birahe laksmi katara antara

anurage birahe byakula kalebara

(6)

biraha ha-ila murtimanta sarpakara

dekhiya laksmira mane ha-ila camatkara

(7)

damsileka se-i sarpa laksmira carane

laksmira swaraga prapti e locana bhane

**TRANSLATION**

1) Laksmipriya-devi, who is devoted to her husband, and who has dedicated her life's breath to her husband, happily serves mother Saci.

2) She dresses and decorates the Deity. She cleans the house. She burns incense, lights lamps, cooks for the Deity, prepares sandal paste and flower garlands, and performs many other like services.

3) Saci artistically decorates the Deity room in many ways. Rapt in this service, she forgets herself.

4) As long as they are rapt in the Deity's service, Saci and Laksmipriya are not broken into pieces by grief.

5) Still, in separation from Lord Gauranga, Laksmipriya finds her heart is tormented with grief. In His absence, her love for Him overwhelms her body.

6) Her grief in His absence eventually assumed the form of a snake. Seeing that snake, Laksmipriya felt great wonder in her heart.

7) That snake bit Laksmipriya's foot. Then Laksmipriya returned to the spiritual world. This Locana dasa says.
