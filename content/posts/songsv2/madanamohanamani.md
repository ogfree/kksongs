**LYRICS:**

(1)

madana mohana mani, gauranga badana khani

rupa heri ki na haila more

sonara varana tanu, ei chila kala kanu

nahile ki mana curi kore?

(2)  
rasera parana jara, kule ki koribe tara

nadiya nagara  hena jana

ki chara daruna mati, majila jubati sati

ghare ghare premera kadana

(3)  
nayana kamala nava , aruna parabhava

dhara bahe mukha buka bahiya

aha mari mari sai, marama tomara kai

jiva na go gora na dekhiya

(4)  
hiyaya premera sara, tanu kaila jara jara

probodha na mane more prani

suradhuni tire jaiya, bhasaiba kula krida

bhajiba se gora gunamani

(5)  
purabe suninu jata, sei saba abhimata

eve bhela kalatanu gora

vasudeva ghosera visnuani, rasika nagara jani

nahila ki gopira mana cora

**TRANSLATION**

1) I consider Gauranga's face to be like Madana mohana's; and when viewing His body - I am unable to describe my captivation! Oh, this Golden youth must have been that Black youth Krsna - for how else could He have stolen my mind?

2) But what about the Nadiya damsels who have a rasika heart, will their so-called family tie be able to stop them? How will they resist Him? And what can we say about the intense agony of Nadiya's chaste young girls -for their love-lorn crying can be heard from every home.

3) Hence their soft, lotus-eyes, conquered by the Gauranga\-sun, now pour tears that stream over their breasts. Oh sakhi! I'm going to pass away ... so just hear my confession

4) Without properly knowing never classify Gora as ordinary -for my mind has fathomed the sweetness of His prema — my body is burning in a fever -and my heart cannot be pacified without Him! Just let me go to the Ganga and drown all of my family obligations; then I shall full worship Gora guna mani.

5) Concerning everything that I've heard about dark-complexioned Krsna - the same applies to Gora. Thus Vasudeva Ghosa says, I know

that He is a Rasika nagara - for how else could He have stolen the gopis' minds?"
