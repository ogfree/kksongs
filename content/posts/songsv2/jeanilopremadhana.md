(1)  
je ānilo prema-dhana koruṇā pracur  
heno prabhu kothā gelā ācārya-ṭhākur

eka-kāle kothā gelā gorā naṭa-rāj

gaurāńga guṇera nidhi kothā gele pābo

se-saba sańgīra sańge je koilo bilās  
se-sańga nā pāiyā kānde narottama dās

**WORD FOR WORD TRANSLATION: [Je Anilo Prema Dhana Koruna Pracura](http://kksongs.org/synonym/j/jeanilopremadhana.html)**

**TRANSLATION**

1) He, who brought the treasure of divine love and who was filled with compassion and mercy--where has such a personality as Advaita Acarya gone?

2) Where are my Svarupa Damodara and Rupa Gosvami? Where is Sanatana? Where is Raghunatha Dasa, the savior of the fallen?

3) Where are my Raghunatha Bhatta and Gopala Bhatta, and where is Krsnadasa Kaviraja? Where did Lord Gauranga, the great dancer, suddenly go?

4) I will smash my head against the rock and enter into the fire. Where will I find Lord Gauranga, the reservoir of all wonderful qualities?

5) Being unable to obtain the association of Lord Gauranga accompanied by all of these devotees in whose association He performed His pastimes, Narottama Dasa simply weeps.

**Remarks/ Extra Information****:**

This song is typically sung in honor of a devotee who has passed away.
