**LYRICS:**

(1)

Folding my hands I humbly humbly place

My bowing head before the graceful two

Sacred lotuslike feet of His Divine Grace

Srila Prabhupadadeva who

(2)

Made the sweet sweet nectar monsoon rains

Of Krsna's mercy fall upon the breath

Of thousands of souls who broke the grim cold chains

That bound thousands of souls to this world of birth and death,

(3)

Who placed the nectar of Krsna's holy name

On thousands of tongues who placed in thousands of hearts

The glistening sacred pure and brilliant flame

Of love for Krsna and who with the graceful arts

(4)

Of poetry translated the holy books

From which Lord Krsna at the reader looks.
