**TRANSLATION**

1) May my mind dwell on that enchanting cowherd boy who relishes the rasa of Radha’s sublime love, which extends to the highest limit of ever-new, playful amorous pastimes.

2) May my mind dwell upon His mass of curling locks, which is fully decorated with a crown of the tail-feathers of an intoxicated peacock. O mind, contemplate on Him. On account of hearing the vibration emanating from His mouth and through His bamboo flute, the multitude of young girls whose exquisite beauty is ever-new and infinitely variegated abandon all fear of social chastisement and chase after Him.

3) May my mind dwell on Him as He is situated (in His three curved bending form) at the base of a wish-fulfilling tree \[i.e. Vamsivata\] by the brilliant sandbanks of the Yamuna, which attends to Him with her gently murmuring waters. O mind, contemplate the soft and charming yellow silken dhoti around His waist, which is enhanced by a girdle of tiny bells that ring sweetly.

4) May my mind dwell upon that beautiful youth whose luster steals the glory of the thunderclouds of the rainy season, and whose lips become sweeter and more enchanting as they vibrate upon the murali. O mind! Contemplate that person who, like a cakora bird, is thirsty to drink the rays of the bewildering and lustrous moonlike face of the young daughter of Vrsabhanu Maharaja.

5) May my mind contemplate the beauty of His ankle-bells, bangles and bejewelled makara\-shaped earrings, as well as His necklace of gunja berries. O my mind, dwell upon He who evokes greed within the hearts of the rasika milkmaids of Vraja through His lovely glances and gentle, sweet smiles.

6) May my mind dwell upon He who wears around His neck a swaying garland of forest flowers that charms the intoxicated, humming bees. O mind, contemplate His broad and mighty arms, which are massaged with scented oil and duly become beautifully covered with symptoms of ecstasy.

7) O my mind! Dwell on His nose, which is adorned with a pearl ornament inlaid in gold. Dwell upon His gracefully curling locks and His brilliant bejeweled tilaka. Dear mind, contemplate His charming face, which resembles a blossoming lotus and which is effulgent like millions of autumn moons

8) May my mind dwell upon His captivating, ever-fresh, extremely youthful body, which bends at His neck, waist and feet. O my mind! Contemplate on Him who, although very sober, take delights in the battles of Cupid within the ever newer, sheltered forest-groves of Vrndavana.

9) O mind! Contemplate His lustrous body, which is lavishly anointed with sandalwood pulp mixed with saffron and which is itself the very essence of fragrance. Dwell upon that form from which the waves of cupid issue forth and which is solely constituted of the condensed mellows of the highest bliss.

10) Dear mind, dwell on the effulgence emanating from the jewel-like moons of His toenails, seeing which the assembled multitudes of Cupids become embarrassed. Contemplate this ever-new prince of Vraja who is most adept in enacting astonishing pleasure pastimes.

11) O mind! Dwell upon this nectarean form of Madhava as described by the rasika Prabhodhananda Sarasvati, and which is the essence of all rasa. Those who are wise delight in it within their hearts and become successful in their goal, whereas fools wander in the cycle of repeated birth and death. What exists for them but temporary illusion?
