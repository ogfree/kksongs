**LYRICS:**

(1)

gaura naba-ghana prema-dhara baririla

tarita tapita jiba tirapita bhela

(2)

durmati kathina mati bhakti\-care cura

upajila jiba\-hade premera ankura

(3)

se ankure bhakti-bari nita-i secila

dine dine prema-taru badhiya uthila

(4)

dharila premera phala saba jiba\-tare

ananta bancita bhela nija karma-phere

**TRANSLATION**

1) The new raincloud of Lord Gaura showered a monsoon of ecstatic spiritual love, a monsoon that delighted the thirsty souls suffering from the burning heat.

2) The ploughman of devotional service plowed the hard earth of the sinners’ wicked hearts and broke up its hardness. Then the plowman watered that ground. Then the first sprout of ecstatic spiritual love appeared.

3) Lord Nitai nourished that sprout with the waters of devotional service. Day by day the tree of ecstatic spiritual love grew and grew.

4) Finally that tree bore the fruit of ecstatic spiritual love, a fruit that delivers every soul. Alas! Ananta dasa could not taste that fruit. His own past karma cheated him of that fruit.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

Ragas Mangala or Miyan Malhara are the ideal choices for this song.
