**TRANSLATION**

1) O Krsna, taking breakfast early in the morning, You wandered in Vrndavana, placing the calves in front. It was there that You saw the demon Bakasura, whose gigantic body appeared just like a mountain peak.

2) O Krsna, when You were swallowed by Bakasura with His sharp beak, Your cowherd friends fainted. Staying within the demon's mouth, You playfully burned his palate.

3) O Krsna, expelled form the Baka demon’s mouth, You bifurcated his beak (and killed him). Balarama and the other cowherd boys embraced You, and the demigods praised You and showered flowers upon You. All glories to You.
