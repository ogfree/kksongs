**TRANSLATION**

Refrain: O Lord Krsna, all glories unto You, all glories unto You. Delighting in the pastimes of the rasa\-dance, You enchant the minds of those expert at relishing the devotional mellows and You grant to them pure transcendental love for Your lotus feet.

1) O Lord Krsna, as You entered the kaisora\-age (ten until fifteen years), Your sweetness greatly increased and Your pastimes became very glorious. Very submissive to the wishes of Your dear devotees, You then kept the promise that You had formerly made to the gopis of Vraja.

2) O Lord Krsna, because Your devotees appealed for the flood of Your own pure love, You performed the rasa\-dance, dismissing Your own ability to enjoy unlimitedly without anyone else's hello, and considering Your own scriptural injunctions as insignificant.

3) O Lord Krsna, with the rising of the autumn moon in the evening, You became intent on enjoying pastimes of conjugal love. Expert at the art of attracting others, You enchanted the gopis with the music (of your flute).

4) O Lord Krsna, when the pious gopis (heard the sound of Your flute), they rejected all prohibitions, abandoned their duties and waiting cowherd husbands, and (left to) attain Your association.
