**LYRICS:**

(1)

nitai nam hate o ke jabire bhai, ay chute

ese pasanda jagai madhai dujan sakal hater mal nile jute

(2)

hater amsi mahajon, sri adwaita sanatan

bhandari sri gadadhar pandit vicaksan

(3)

achen caukidar haridas adi holen sri sanjay

sri sridhar mate dalal kesava bharati sri vidya vacaspati

paricarak achen krsna dasa prabhrti

hon kosadhyaksa srivas pandit, jhadudar kedar jute

(4)

hater mulya nirupon, naya bhakti prakasana,

prema heno mudra sarbasar, samyaman nai komi besi saman

(5)

o jon re, sob ek mane bojhay uthe.

ei premer uddesa, ek sadhu upadesa

sudhamoy harinam rupa su-sandesa

ete boro nai re dvesadvesa

khay ek pate kanakuthe.

**TRANSLATION**

1-5) Nityandanda has come to the Marketplace of the Name.  Whoever's coming, run quickly.  Those two rascals Jagai and Madhai have looted the storehouse and taken all the goods.  You will find the partners Adwaita, Sanatan, the store house managers. Gadadhar Pandit is the guard, Haridas is the watch man, Sanjay and Sridhar are the bearers.  Kesava Bharati and Vidyavacaspati are brokers and Krsna Das and others are managers.  Srivas Pandit is the treasurer, and Kedarnath is the sweeper.  The cost of the goods in the store, are nine kinds of devotional service.  The gold coin is prema.  There is no limit, with whatever you have, buy, there is no shortage people, take as much of the goods as you can.  For obtaining love of God this is good advice.  The message is the nectarean name of the Lord, so let there be no useless strife.  Let everyone, whoever he may be, eat from the same plate.
