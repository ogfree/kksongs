(1)

baso mere nayanana me nandalāla

(2)

mohana mūrati, śyāmarī sūrati, nayanā bane viśāla

(3)

adhara sudhārasa, muralī bājata, ura vaijantīmāla

(4)

kṣudra ghaṇṭikā kaṭitaṭa śobhita, nūpura śabda rasāla

(5)

mīrā prabhu santana sukhadāyī, bhakta vatsala gopāla

**TRANSLATION**

1) May Nandalala always be present before my eyes.

2) May the enchanting form and beautiful face of Syama always be present before my eyes.

3) His lips exude pure nectar as He plays the flute, and a vaijanti-mala adorns His chest.

4) Tiny bells adorn His waist and the sound of His anklebells is very sweet.

5) The master of Mira is Gopala, who is especially affectionate to His devotees and gives immense pleasure to the saints.
