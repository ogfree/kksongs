2) The son of Mother Saci wanders throughout the abode of Nadiya singing the holy names of Krsna, which are the deliverer of all living beings imprisoned within the age of Kali, as follows:

3) "O Lord Hari! Obeisances unto Hari, who is Krsna, the best of the Yadus, the herder of the cows, the pleasure of the cows, the supreme enjoyer, and the blessed killer of the demon named Madhu."
