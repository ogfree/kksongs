**LYRICS:**

(1)

hari he

bhramite soḿsāra\-bane      kabhu daiba-samghaṭane

kona\-mate kona bhāgyabān

taba pada uddeśiyā       thāke kṛtāñjali hoya

eka-bāra ohe bhagabān

(2)

sei khaṇe tā'ra jata          amańgala hoya hata

su-mańgala hoya puṣṭa ati

ā;ra nāhi khaya hoya      krame tā'ra śubhodoya

tā're deya sarbottama-gati

(3)

emona doyālu tumi        emona durbhāgā āmi

kabhu nā korinu paraṇāma

taba pada-padma prati         nā jāne e duṣṭa-mati

bhaktibinodera pariṇāma

**TRANSLATION**

1) Oh my Lord Hari! While wandering about in the forest of this material world, some fortunate soul may be able to get a momentary glimpse of Your lotus feet just once, by some unseen influence of destiny, and he receives that visions of Your lotus feet with folded hands.

2) At that very moment all inauspiciousness becomes dissipated, and he very much relishes the nourishment of divine auspiciousness. This never decreases, for You gradually awaken his eternal well-being by bestowing upon such a fortunate soul the topmost goal of life.

3) Thus You are such a liberal and magnanimous Lord, but I have never offered my respectful obeisances unto Your lotus feet. Therefore my wicked mentality cannot comprehend anything. This is Bhaktivinoda's resultant unfortunate position.
