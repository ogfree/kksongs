**LYRICS:**

(refrain)

maiń to giridhara ke rańga rātī

(1)

paca rańga cola pahara sakhī re

jhuramuṭa khelana jātī

jhuramuṭa maiń mohe milayā sāńvaroń

khola mile tana gātī

(2)

koī ke piyā para desa basata haiń

likha likha bhejata pāti

mere piyā mere mana meń virāje

bāta karūń dina rāti

(3)

pīhara rahūń nā sāńsare meń

prabhu se saina lagāte

mīrā kahe prabhu giridhara nāgara

carana rahūń dina rāti

**TRANSLATION**

Refrain: I am colored in love for Giridhari.

1) The girls are wearing the outfit known as pacaranga and playing the Rajasthani game of jhuramuta. During this game of jhuramuta, I meet my Beloved One, open my veil, and sing my heart to Him.

2) Other people have lovers living in other countries. They write to them to communicate to them. My lover lives in my heart. I stay up all night talking to Him.

3) I do not go to my family or my in-laws. I give my Lord the signal. Mira Bai says to her courtly Giridhara, “I will remain at Your feet, day and night.”

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This is sung in Raga Jogiya in Bhajani Tala. This song is popularized by Dilraj Kaur’s ISKCON album “Prabhu Vandana.”
