**TRANSLATION**

1) O Bhagavad-gita, thou hast been instructed to Arjuna, the son of Prtha by the Lord Himself and afterwards thee were included within the Mahabharata by the ancient sage Vyasa.  Thy eighteen divine chapters are a shower of the immortal nectar of the wisdom of the Absolute.  O mother, destroyer of man's rebirth into the darkness of this mortal world, upon thee I meditate.

2) Obeisances to You, O Vyasa, thou art of mighty intellect, and thine eyes are large as the petals of the full-blown lotus.  It was by thee that the oil-filled lamp of knowledge of the Mahabharata was lit.

3) I offer obeisances unto Lord Krsna, the refuge of ocean-born Laksmi and all who take refuge at His lotus feet. His one hand holds a staff for driving cows, and the other hand is raised, the thumb touching the tip of the forefinger, indicating divine knowledge.  He is the milker of the immortal nectar of the Bhagavad-gita.

4) The Upanisads are as a herd of cows, Lord Krsna, son of a cowherd, is their mother, Arjuna is the calf, the supreme nectar of the Gita is the milk, and the wise man of purified intellect is the drinker.

5) I offer my obeisances to Lord Krsna, the beloved son of Vasudeva, destroyer of the demons Kamsa and Canura, the supreme bliss of Mother Devaki and the spiritual master of the universe.

6) Of the terrifying river of the battlefield of Kuruksetra over which the Pandavas victoriously crossed, Bhisma and Drona were it's high banks, Jayadratha was the river's water, the King of Gandhara, the blue water-lily: there were sharks such as salya, Krpa was the current, Karna, the mighty waves, Asvattham and Vikarna, the dreadful alligators, and Duryodhana, the very whirlpool, but Lord Krsna was the ferryman!

7) May the spotless lotus of the words of Vyasa that grows on the eternal waters of the words of Lord Hari, with its filaments of various tales of heroes and which is rightly endowed with the sweet fragrance of the explanations of the Bhagavad-gita, it's nectar beign quaffed with pleasure daily in this world by saintly persons who are compared to so many nectar-seeking bumble-bees and which destroys all the sins of the age of Kali - May this lotus of the Mahabharata bestow on us the highest good.

8) I offer my respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krsna, the transcendentally blissful husband of the goddess of fortune, whose mercy turns the dumb into eloquent speakers and enables to lame to cross mountains.

9) Unto that personality whom Brahma, Varuna, Indra, Rudra and the Maruts praise by chanting transcendental hymns and reciting the Vedas with all their corollaries, pada-kramas and Upanisads, to whom the chanters of the Sama Veda always sing, whom the perfected yogis see within their minds after fixing themselves in trance and absorbing themselves within Him, and whose limit can never be found by any demigod or demon — unto that Supreme Personality of Godhead I offer my humble obeisances.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

Verse 5 is the first verse of Adi Sankaracarya’s [**Krsnastakam**](http://kksongs.org/songs/v/vasudevasutamdevam.html).

The ninth verse is often sung with the suffixed-line “śrī guruḿ dīna-tāraṇam” offering obeisances to the “spiritual master that is the redeemer of the fallen.”

The final verse comes from the Srimad Bhagavatam Canto 12 Chapter 13 Verse 1.
