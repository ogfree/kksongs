**TRANSLATION**

1) Lord Krsna wears yellow garments and His lovely, dark complexioned body is decorated with sandalwood paste. While He enjoys loving pastimes with His gopis, His jewel earrings dance over His cheeks as He smiles at them.

2) Look Radhe! Look at Krsna’s loving and divine lila with all of His surrendered gopis!

3) One beautiful gopi lovingly smacks Krsna with the heavy weight of her devotion! Then she sings to Him from the fifth scale at a higher octave.

4-5) One charmed gopi fixes her love filled gaze upon Krsna’s mukharvinda.Aho! Her playful, batting eyes light become lamps of love for Krsna’s heart! A gopi attempts to whisper something to Krsna’s ear, but ends up kissing His cheek.

6) One haughty gopi grabs hold of Krsna’s garments to playfully pull Him into a solitary location beside the Yamuna.

7) Another gopi is dancing with the rasa with Krsna. As He plays the flute; she claps her hands making her bracelets sweetly tinkle in time with the music. Seeing her skill, Krsna praises.

8) Krsna embraces a gopi, kisses another, and associates with someone else. Then, He eagerly smiles to attract another gopi with His vulnerable eyes. However, noticing a resisting damsel, who is ever more beautiful, He begins pursuing her.

9)  O reader! Let Jayadeva’s description of Sri Kesava’s amazing and secret Vrndavana prema keli bring good fortune to you.
