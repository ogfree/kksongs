(1)

deva deva jagan-natha prapannarti vinasana

trahi mam pundarikaksa patitam bhava-sagare

(2)

namas te jagadadhara jagad\-atman namo ‘stu te

kaivalya trigunatita gunanjana namo ‘stu te

(3)

karunamrta pathodhi sudhamne namo namah

dinoddharaika guhyaya krpapathodaye namah

(4)

paritrahi jagan-natha dina bandho namo ‘stu te

nistirno ‘ham bhavambodhim prapya tvam taranim sukham

**TRANSLATION**

1) O God of Gods! O Jagannatha, the Lord of the Universe! Please destroy this great distress that has overcome me! O Lotus-eyed One! Please deliver this fallen soul from the ocean of material existence!

2) I offer my obeisances unto You, the support of the universe. To You, the very soul of the universe, I humbly bow. You are situated above the three material qualities and the impersonal brahman as well, yet You are decorated with wonderful transcendental qualities. To You I offer my respectful obeisances.

3) O You who are an ocean of nectarean compassion and whose abode is most attractive, I offer my obeisances to You again and again! You uplift and deliver the fallen souls, but how you do this no one can understand. O ocean of mercy, I offer you my respectful obeisances!

4) O Lord Jagannatha, O friend of the fallen, I offer my obeisances unto You! Please deliver me from this vast material ocean! By Your mercy may I cross beyond it and, taking shelter of Your lotus feet, become supremely happy.
