**TRANSLATION**

1) O Nanda Lal, come into my courtyard. Come Gopal! This old woman is thirsting to have Your darsan.

2) Come child! Come and eat butter in my courtyard.

3) I want to hear your charming, childish talking which is so sweet. Come! This old woman is hankering to have Your darsan.

4) Besides, You're not resting for a moment. Rather You are running around here and there. So You might as well come here too.

5) Whether You come or go, Nanda Lal, this old woman is thirsting to have Your darsan.
