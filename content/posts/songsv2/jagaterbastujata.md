**LYRICS:**

(1)

hari he

jagatera bastu jata        baddha saba swabhābata

deśa kāla bastu simāśroya

tumi prabhu sarbeśwara        naha sīmā-bidhi-para

bidhi saba kampe taba bhoya

(2)

sama bā adhika taba      swabhābataḥ asambhāba

bidhi lańghi' taba abasthāna

swatantra swabhāba dharo      āpane gopana koro

māyā\-bale kori' adhiṣṭhāna

(3)

tathāpi ananya-bhakta         tomāre dekhite śakta

sadā dekhe swarūpa tomāra

e bhaktibinoda dina      ananya bhajana hīna

bhakta-pada-reṇu-mātra sāra

**TRANSLATION**

1) Oh my dear Lord Hari! All the things contained within this universe are by nature conditioned and bound up by the limits of material time, place and circumstances. But You, dear Lord, are not subordinate to any such limitation or even to scriptural injunctions. Indeed, all rules and regulations are trembling in fear of Your Lordship.

2) It is naturally impossible for any kind of law to be equal to, or surpass Your Lordship, for Your transcendental position naturally transgresses all rules and regulations. You possess the Supremely independent nature, and thus You reserve the right to conceal Yourself behind the powerful curtain of maya.

3) Despite this covering screen of maya's illusions, my dear Lord, Your pure unalloyed devotees have the power to see You. Indeed, wherever they turn their eyes, they see Your original personal form there. However, this Bhaktivinoda is very fallen and is completely bereft of unalloyed devotional worship. But he has one hope... he has considered the dust of Your devotees' feet to be the sole essence of his life.
