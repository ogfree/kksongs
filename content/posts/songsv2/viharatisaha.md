**LYRICS:**

(Refrain)

viharati saha rādhikayā rańgī

madhu-madhure vṛndāvana-rodhasi harir iha harṣa-tarańgī

(1)

vikirati yantreritam aghavairiṇi rādhā kuńkuma-pańkam

dayitām ayam api siñcati mṛgamada-rasa-rāśibhir aviśańkam

(2)

kṣipati mitho yuva-mithunam idaḿ navam aruṇataraḿ paṭa-vāsam

jitam iti jitam iti muhur api jalpati kalpayad-atanu-vilāsam

(3)

subalo raṇayati ghana-karatālī jitavān iti vana-mālī

lalitā vadati sanātana-vallabham ajayat paśya mamālī

**TRANSLATION**

Refrain: Tossed by waves of bliss in Vrndavana forest sweet with spring, Lord Hari enjoys transcendental pastimes with Srimati Radhika.

1) Radha splashes Krsna with kunkuma from a syringe. Krsna fearlessly splashes His beloved with musk.

2) The youthful couple throws fragrant red powders at each other. Again and again They call out, "I have won! I have won!" They enjoy many pastimes.

3) Subala loudly claps his hands and proclaims, "Krsna, who wears a garland of forest flowers, is the winner!" Then Lalita says, “Look! My friend has now defeated Her eternal beloved!"

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is sung in Raga Basanta.
