**LYRICS:**

(1)

kabe mor mudha mana chadi anya dhyana

sri-krsna-carane pabe bisramer sthana

(2)

kabe ami janibo apane akincana

amar apeksa ksudra nahi anya jana

(3)

kabe ami acandale koribo pranati

krsna-bhakti magi laba koriya minati

(4)

sarva\-jibe doya mor kotadine habe

jiber durgati dekhi lotaka padipe

(5)

kandite kandite ami jabo brndabana

brajadhame baisnaber loibo sarana

(6)

brajabasi-sannidhane judi dui kar

jijnasibo lila-sthana hoiya katar

(7)

ohe brajabasi! more anugraha kori

dekhao kothay lila korilena hari

(8)

tabe kon braja-jana sakrpa-antare

amare jabena loye bipina-bhitore

(9)

bolibena, dekho ei kadamba-kanana

jatha rasalila koila brajendranandana

(10)

ai dekho nandagrama nander avasa

ai dekho baladeva jatha koilo rasa

(11)

ai dekho jatha hoilo dukula-harana

ai sthane bakasura hoilo nidhana

(12)

eirupe braja-jana-saha brndabane

dekhibo lilar sthana satrsna-nayane

(13)

kabhu ba jamuna tire suni' bamsi-dhvani

abasa hoiya labha koribo dharani

(14)

krpamoy braja-jana 'krsna krsna' boli'

pana koraibe jal puriya anjali

(15)

harinama sune punah paiya cetana

braja-jana-saha ami koribo bhramana

(16)

kabe heno subhadina hoibe amar

madhukori kori' bedaibo dvar dvar

(17)

jamuna-salila pibo anjali bhariya

devadvare ratri\-kale rohibo suiya

(18)

jakhan asibe kala e bhautika pura

jalajantu-mahotsava hoibe pracura

(19)

siddha dehe nija-kunje sakhira carane

nityakala thakiya sevibo krsna-dhane

(20)

ei se praithana kore' e pamara char

sri jahnava more doyakoro' eibar

**TRANSLATION**

1) When, oh when will my foolish ass-like mind finally attain a place to rest at the lotus feet of Lord Krsna, rejecting all other meditation?

2) When will I finally understand my own worthlessness? Actually there is not other soul who is lower than me.

3) When will I offer my respectful obeisances unto all the untouchables? Submitting prayers unto them I will humbly beg for a drop of devotion to Lord Krsna.

4) And when will I finally exhibit real compassion to all living entities? Seeing the degradation of the conditioned souls I will fall to the ground weeping.

5) Weeping and weeping, I will sadly go to Sri Vrndavana, and I will take shelter of a Vaisnava in that abode of Vraja.

6) Standing before a resident of Vraja I will grasp both of his hands and will question him intensively about all the holy places of the Lord's pastimes there.

7) I will say: "Oh resident of Vraja! Please exhibit your favor to me and kindly show me where all the pastimes of Hari had taken place."

8) Then, with a gracious heart, some resident of the dhama will personally take me within the depths of the forest.

9) He will say: "Just look there! That is the kadamba grove in which the delightful Son of Maharaja Nanda sported the rasa dance."

10) "Look! Here is Nanda-grama, which is the residence of Nanda Maharaja. Look! Here is where Lord Balarama sported His own rasa dance."

11) "Look! Here is where Lord Krsna stole the clothes of all the gopis as they bathed. And just see this place! It is where the demon Bakasura met his fate."

12) In this fashion I will behold all of the places of pastimes in Vrndavana with my intensely thirsty eyes in the company of the residents of Vraja.

13) I ever I hear the vibration of a flute upon the banks of the Yamuna river, then becoming ecstatically overwhelmed I will fall senseless upon the earth.

14) Chanting the holy names, "Krsna, Krsna" into my ears, then the all merciful residents of Vraja will take a palmful of Yamuna water and make me drink.

15) By hearing the holy names being vibrated and again becoming conscious, I will then continue wandering about in the company of the Brijbasis.

16) When, oh when will such auspicious days be mine? Begging like a bee (madhukori) I will wander from door to door.

17) I will drink a little water from the Yamuna, filling my palm. And at night I will go to sleep by the door of some temple I happen to wander near.

18) Then that time will come when this material body will become a tasty feast for all of the aquatics. (When it is thrown into the river at the time of death.)

19) Then, living eternally in my spiritual body, at the feet of a gopi in her own grove, I will finally serve my greatly treasured Lord Krsna.

20) Oh Jahnava Devi! Please show your causeless mercy to me now! This is all that is prayed for today by this desperate, worthless sinner.
