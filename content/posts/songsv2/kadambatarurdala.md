**LYRICS:**

(1)

kadamba tarura ḍāla, nāmiyāche bhūme bhāla,

phuṭiyāche phula sāri sāri

parimale bharalo, sakala vṛndāvana,

keli kore bhramarā bhramarī

(2)

rāi kānu vilasaye rańge

kibā rūpa lāvani, vaidagadhi khani dhani,

maṇimaya ābharaṇa ańge

(3)

rādhāra dakṣiṇa kara, dhari priya giridhara,

madhura madhura coli yāy

āge pāche sakhī-gaṇa, kore phula variṣaṇa

kono sakhī cāmara ḍhulāya

(4)

parāge dhūsara sthala, candre kore suśītala,

maṇimaya vedīra upore

rāi kānu kara joḍi, nṛtya kore phiri phiri,

paraśe pulake tanu bhare

**TRANSLATION**

1) In Vrndavana the kadamba trees offer obeisances, their flowering branches reverently touching the ground.  Bumble bees enjoy pastimes in Vrndavana, which is filled with a very sweet fragrance. 

2) Radha and Krsna stay in the place where They enjoy pastimes.  How beautiful They are.  Their bodies are decorated with jewel ornaments, and They are wealthy with many gem mines of intelligence and wit. 

3) Dear Giridhari holds Srimati Radharani's right hand, and together They gracefully stroll about.  The gopis shower flowers before and behind Them, and one gopi fans them with a camara whisk. 

4) That place is filled with the aromatic pollen of the lotus, and it is made pleasantly cool by the shining of the moon.  On a raised platform there, Radha and Krsna dance, holding hands, the hairs of Their bodies standing up in ecstasy.
