**TRANSLATION**

1) Srila Rupa Gosvami, after intensely studying all the devotional scriptures, has made the following conclusive definition of pure devotional service: Giving up all desires for fruitive reward or philosophical jugglery, one should execute favorable devotional service to Krsna for his pleasure only.

2) The divisions of regulated devotional service are: 1) hearing the glories of the Lord, 2) chanting His holy names, 3) remembering Him within the core of the heart, 4) serving His lotus feet, 5) worshiping His Deity form, 6) becoming His menial servant, 7) offering prayers to Him revealing the mind, 8) entering into a friendly relationship with Him, and 9) ultimately surrendering one's whole existence in full dedication by mind, body and words. The practicing neophyte devotees continuously perform all of these nine processes joyfully in the association of saintly persons who are adept in hones devotional dedication.

3) By the strength of the above-mentioned ninefold practices of regulated devotional service, the devotion thereafter fructifies into an ecstatic emotional service attitude, and after that one reawakens his original pure ecstatic love of Godhead. In such transcendental love, the soul whole-heartedly worships Krsna, constantly immersed in tasting the ecstatic mellows of devotion to Him. This is the delicious mellow that Srila Rupa Gosvami is teaching us about.
