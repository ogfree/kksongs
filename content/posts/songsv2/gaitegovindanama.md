**LYRICS:**

(1)

gāite govinda-nām,  upajilo bhāva-grām,

dekhilām jamunāra kūle

bṛṣabhānu-sutā-sańge,  śyāma-naṭa-bara rańge,

bāńśarī bājāya nīpa-mūle

(2)

dekhiyā yugala-dhana,  asthira hoilo mana,

jñāna-hārā hoinu takhon

koto-kṣane nāhi jāni,  jñāna-labha hoilo māni,

āra nāhi bhelo daraśan

**TRANSLATION**

1) Upon singing the holy name of Govinda, a host of ecstasies arose within me... and I saw Lord Syamasundara, the best of dancing actors, standing on the banks of the Yamuna in the company of the daughter of Maharaja Vrsabhanu. He was playing His flute with great delight at the base of a kadamba tree.

2) Seeing the treasured Divine Couple of Vraja, my mind became unsteady and I lost consciousness. I do not know for how long I was unconscious, but when I awoke that vision of Radha and Krsna was no longer present.
