**LYRICS:**

(refrain)

re manavā! prema jagata kā sār

prema pujārina rādherāṇī kṛṣṇa prema avatāra

(1)

prema hi murali prema hi yamuna prema hi rādhe prema hi kṛṣṇa

ek dūje ke yeh anurāgi saba ne jagāī prema ki tṛṣṇa

prema meń ḍūbe prāṇa karata hai prema ki jaya jayakāra

(2)

prema ḍagara pe calate calate bhakti kī pāvan nadiyā āye

bhakti kī nadiyā bahate bahate prema ke sāgara meń kho jāye

bhakti kī dono ora prema hai bhakti khaḍe majhadhāra

**TRANSLATION**

Refrain: O mind! Pure love is the essence of all. The worshipper of love is Srimati Radharani and Krsna is the incarnation of love.

1) Love is the Lord’s flute. Love is the Yamuna River. Love is the Divine Couple, Radha and Krsna! Their intense love for each other awakens the aspiration for His love. The soul that’s drowned in love will praise the power of love.

2) While traveling on the path of love, one reaches the river of devotional service. The river of devotional service merges into the ocean of love. The two ends of the river of devotional service are love.
