**LYRICS:**

(1)

rūpānuga tattwa-sāra          bujhite akańkha jāńra

rasa-jñāna tāńra prayojana

cinmoya ānanda-rasa      sarba-tattwa jāńra baśa

akhaṇḍa parama tattwa-dhana

(2)

jāńra bhāṇe jñāni jana        brahmāloya-anweṣaṇa

kore nāhi bujhi' beda-marma

jāńra chāyā-mātra bore        jogī-jana joga kore

jāra chale karmi kore karma

(3)

bibhāba anubhāba āra          sāttwika sañcārī cāra

sthāyī bhābe milana śundara

sthāyī bhābe rasa hoya        nitya cid-ānanda-moya

parama āswādya nirantara

(4)

je rasa prapañca-gata         joḍa-kābye prokāśita

parama rasera asan-mūrti

asan-mūrti nitya hoya          ādarśera chāyā hoya

jena marīcikā jala-sphūrti

**TRANSLATION**

1) Whoever has a longing to understand the essential truth of the reality of rupanuga, then for him it is necessary to have some basic knowledge of transcendental mellows. And such spiritually blissful conscious mellows influence and control all other subordinate truths, for they are the hidden treasure of the supreme, absolutely undividable Truth of all Truths.

2) In pursuit of this same spiritual mellow, the philosophical speculators search for fusing themselves with the impersonal Brahman effugence, not understanding the real import of the Vedic conclusion. And all the desired boons of the yogis are simply shadow reflections of this rasa. On the plea of this taste, the karmis execute all their fruitive activities.

3) The permanent basis of ecstatic mellow is called "stayi bhava", and is abounding in eternal, conscious bliss. It becomes the topmost relishable euphoria when it mixes into a beautifully delicious combination with these four elements: 1) Vibhava (specific stimulants and supporting characters) 2) Anubhava (thirteen resultant ecstatic symptoms) 3) Sattvika (eigth especially disruptive ecstatic symptoms) 4) Sancari (thirty-three transitory accompanying emotions).

4) When rasa is expressed in the material world, it is praised throughout the materialistic literature of the world, but that is only a perverted reflection of this supreme mellow. It is temporary and is just like an imitation copy of the real thing, similar to a mirage which appears to be water in a desert.
