**LYRICS**

(Refrain)

he rī maiń to prema dīvānī, merā dard na jāne koya  
  

(1)

sūlī ūpara seja hamārī, kisa bidha sonā hoya  
gagana maṇḍala pai seja piyā kī, kisa bidha milana hoya

(2)

ghāyala kī gati ghāyala jānai, kī jina lāī hoya  
jauhar kī gati jauhar jānai, kī jina jauhar hoya

(3)

dard kī mārī bana bana ḍolūm baida milā nahim koya  
mīrā kī prabhu pīra miṭaigī jaba baida sāńvaliyā hoya

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain:) Oh oh! I'm love-crazy. No one knows my pain.

  
1) My bed is over the gallows. How could I sleep? My lover's bed is in heaven's mandala. How could I get to him?  
  

2) The one who is wounded knows what a wound means, what it means to be burned. The jeweler knows what it means to be a jeweler, what it means to have a jewel.  
  

3) Afflicted by pain, I wander from forest to forest. I cannot get a doctor O Lord, Mira's torment will be wiped out when the doctor is the Dark Lover.

**Remarks/ Extra Information****:**

This song is heard in the 1979 film “Meera.” This is rendered in Raga Todi in Dadra Tala.
