**LYRICS:**

(Refrain)

jaya jaya jaga-jana-locana-phānda

rādhā-ramaṇa bṛndābana-cānda

(1)

abhinaba nīlajalada tanu ḍhala ḍhala

piñcha mukuṭa śire sājani re

kāñcana basana  ratanamaya ābharaṇa

nūpura raṇaraṇi bājanī re

añcala cañcala kusuma-śare

abicala kula ramaṇī-gaṇa mānasa

jara jara antare madana-bhare

(3)

bani bana-māla  ājānu-lambita

parimale ali-kula māti rahu

bimbādhara pare mohana muralī

gā-ota gobinda-dāsa-pahu

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) Glory, glory to the Lord who is Radha's lover, the Lord who is like a trap to catch the eyes of the world's people, the Lord who is like a moon shining in Vrndavana!

1) His form glistens like a dark new rain cloud. A peacock-feather crown adorns His head. His garments are golden. His ornaments are made of jewels. His anklets jangle.

2) His graceful eyes are two blue lotus flowers. The restless glances from His eyes' corners are arrows of flowers, arrows that wound the saintly gopis' amorous hearts.

3) A forest-flower garland hangs to His knees. Its fragrance makes the black bees wild with bliss. Placing the flute to His bimba\-fruit lips, Govinda dasa's master plays enchanting melodies.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is sung in Raga Sri.
