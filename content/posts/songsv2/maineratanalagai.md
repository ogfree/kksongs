**WORD FOR WORD TRANSLATION: [Maine Ratana Lagai Radha Nama Ki](http://kksongs.org/synonym/m/maineratanalagai.html)**

**TRANSLATION**

Refrain: I am ever engaged in repeating the sweet name of Radha.

1) Radha is there in the blinking of my eyes. Radha is there in the curls of my hair. I have filled up the very part of my hair. Oh! With the sweet name of Radha.

2) Radha is there within my vision. Radha is there within my speech. I interweave my every word. Oh! With the sweet name of Radha.

3) Radha is there in my necklace. Radha is there in my sari. I have adorned my nose ring. Oh! With the sweet name of Radha.

4) Radha is there in my walking. Radha is there in my gestures. My sash of waist-bells resounds. Oh! With the sweet name of Radha.

5) Radha is there on my right and on my left. Radha is there in front of me and behind. My every fiber reflects the rasa flowing. Oh! With the sweet name of Radha.

6) Radha is there on my each and every limb. Radha is there accompanying me always. Lord Gopala plays His flute which calls out. Oh! With the sweet name of Radha.
