**TRANSLATION**

1) Oh my Lord Hari! I am simply a two-legged animal, completely bereft of proper behavior. I have been suffering great difficulties unlimitedly since time immemorial. And moreover, I have unavoidably become the repository of all types of sinful activities.

2) You are certainly an ocean of compassion, and You are the only real friend of the universe. Your affection is just like a boundless, unfathomable sea of loving relationships. Simply by remembering Your wonderful qualities, my material bonds are being severed and I will become eternally fearless.

3) Now Bhativinoda sings about all these desires which he has within his mind while prostrated at the lotus feet of Sri Yamunacarya. And he begs Sri Yamunacarya to kindly bestow upon his head the quintessence of the fragrant immortal nectar which flows from the lotus feet of that moon-like person Who glows within the forests on the bank of the river Yamuna in Vraja.
