**LYRICS:**

(Refrain)

sakhi dam-patyor anayor yugalam

kurute kim api ca na smṛti-yugalam

(1)

kairaviṇī-kulam alir iha visṛjati

tad api vihāraḿ kaḿ vā na sṛjati

(2)

visinī-kulam atha diśi diśi vilasati

tad api ca natarāḿ bahir anu vikasati

(3)

dinakara-sārathir udayaḿ gacchati

tatra ca nayanaḿ nāṇv api yacchati

(4)

tārāvalir atha rucim utkalayati

etat punar iha tam ucchalayati

(5)

vīnāḿ tatir api kalam ākalayati

tad api ca maunaḿ nitarāḿ valayati

(6)

dadhi-mathanaḿ vraja-nilaye ninadati

ākāritam api tad idaḿ na vadati

(7)

udgānād api tad idaḿ kavir api

bahir upalabhyaḿ na nayati ravir api

**TRANSLATION**

Refrain: Friend, you do not remember anything of the Divine Couple.

1) At night a bumblebee leaves the lotus flowers. He will not play among them.

2) In the daytime the lotus flowers are splendid in every direction, but at night they close their petals. They refuse to follow the example of the glittering stars.

3) The sun-god's charioteer, the dawn, has now come. Still, the lotus flowers will not open their eyes even slightly to see him.

4) Now the stars renounce their splendors. Now the Divine Couple splendidly appears berfore us.

5) Giving up their silence, the birds sing.

6) The village of Vraja is filled with sounds of yogurt being churned. Still, no one tells anything about the Divine Couple's pastimes.

7) The poet sings in a loud voice. The sun does not bring him to sing about anything else.
