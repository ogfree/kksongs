**LYRICS**

(1)

aichana bacana kahala yaba kāna

braja-ramaṇī-gaṇa sajala nayāna

(2)

ṭutāla sabahu manoratha karaṇī

abanata ānane nakhe likhu dharaṇī

(3)

ākula antara gadagada kaha-i

akaruṇa bacana biśikha nāhi saha-i

(4)

śuna śuna su-kapaṭa śyāmara canda

kaiche kahasi tuhu iha anubandha

(5)

bhāńgahi kula-śīla muralīka-gāne

kińkiṇī-gaṇa janu keśa dhari āne

(6)

aba kaha kapaṭe dharama-yuta bola

dhārmika haraye kiye kumārī nicola

(7)

tohe soḿpita jība tuyā rasa pāba

tuyā pada choḍi aba ko kāḿhā yāba

(8)

etahu kahata braja-yubatī mela

śuni nanda-nandana haraṣita bhela

(9)

kabi parasāda tahi karaye bilāsa

ānande nirakhaye gobinda-dāsa

**TRANSLATION**

1) When Lord Krsna spoke these words, tears flowed from the gopis' eyes.

2) The gopis' desires were all broken into pieces. The gopīs bowed their heads. With their toenails they scratched the ground.

3) Their hearts were overcome. They spoke broken words in choked voices. They could not bear Krsna's cruel sharp words.

4) "Listen. Listen, O cruel dark moon Krsna. Why do You speak these words?

5) "Your flute music broke our saintliness into pieces. Now we are Your maidservants. It is You who hold us by the hair.

6) "Now You speak these crooked words of pretended dharma. How can a saintly girl remove even her cloak in front of You?

7) "We have given our lives to You. We yearn to taste the nectar of Your company. Where will we go if we leave Your feet?"

8)  These words the girls of Vraja spoke. Hearing them, Lord Krsna became happy.

9) By the mercy of a saintly poet (Srīla Sukadeva Goswami), Govinda dasa joyfully watches these pastimes.
