(1)

gurudeva bolechilo kaniṣṭha e saba

eto-dine bujhilām tāńra vāṇī rava

(2)

śāstra yukte sunipuṇa dṛḍha śraddhā yāra

uttama adhikārī sei tāraya saḿsāra

(3)

patita pāvana tini jagate-te khyāti

e patite uddhāraha tabe to’ sukhyāti

(4)

kali kāler jīva saba patita adhama

dekhiyāo nāhi dekhe ihā ki karama

**TRANSLATION**

1) Our spiritual master said these are all kanistha adhikaris. Now, I can understand the truth of what he said that day.

2) One well versed in the scripture and who has strong faith is an uttama-adhikari and can deliver the whole world.

3) He is the deliverer of the most fallen and is famous through the world. Now, save this fallen one and thus become really famed.

4) In Kali Yuga, everyone is a fallen and the lowest. They do not see what activities they are doing.
