**LYRICS:**

(1)

sri-guru-baisnaba-krpa kota dine habe

upadhi-rahita-rati citte upajibe

(2)

kabe siddha-deha mor haibe prakasa

sakhi dekhaibe more jugala-bilasa

(3)

dekhite dekhite rupa hoibo batula

kadamba-kanane ja'bo tyaji' jati kula

(4)

sveda kampa pulakasru baibarnya praloy

stambha swarabheda kabe hoibe udoy

(5)

bhavamoy brndabana heribo nayane

sakhira kinkori ho'ye sevibo du'jane

(6)

kabe narottama-saha saksat hoibe

kabe ba prarthana-rasa citte prevesibe

(7)

caitanya-daser das chadi' anya rati

karayudi' mage aj sri-caitanya mati

**TRANSLATION**

1) After how many days will I get the mercy of the spiritual master and the devotees, which will awaken pure love devoid of designations, in my heart?

2) When, oh when will my perfect spiritual body become manifest so that a confidential girlfriend of Sri Radha will show me the conjugal pastimes of the Divine Couple?

3) In an instant I will take on the form of a mad woman, and will rush to the kadamba forest, renouncing all of my family members.

4) When will I then experience the awakening of the eight sattvika ecstatic symptoms such as perspiring, shivering, jubilation, tears, fading away of bodily color, complete devastation, stupor, and choked voice?

5) I will behold that spiritual abode of Vrndavana-dhama with these very eyes and, becoming the humble maidservant of a sakhi, I will serve those two Persons.

6) When will I ever be able to come into the very presence of Srila Narottama dasa Thakura, and when will the mellows he expressed in his book "Prarthana" enter into my heart?

7) Rejecting any love or attachment for anything else, this servant of the servant of Lord Caitanya begs the guru and the Vaisnavas for the blessing of devotional inclination towards Him only.
