**LYRICS:**

(1)

gaganahi nimagana dinamaṇi kānti

lakha-i nā pāriye kiye dina rāti

(2)

aichana jalada kalaya āndhiyāra

niyaḍahi ko-i lakha-i nāhi pāra

(3)

calu gaja-gāminī hari abhisāra

gamana nirańkuśa ārati bithāra

(4)

caudike athira pabana taru dola

jaga bhari śīkara-nikara hilola

(5)

ḍhala-ite gorī nagara pura-bāṭa

mandire mandire lāgala kapāṭa

(6)

yaba dhani kuñje milala hari pāśa

dūrahi dūre rahu gobinda-dāsa

**TRANSLATION**

1) The sky's sunlight suddenly plunges into darkness. Is it day or night? I have no power to see.

2) A great cloud has brought blinding darkness. No one can see even the nearest object.

3) Walking like a graceful elephant, a beautiful gopi goes to meet Krsna. She is ecstatic with loving feelings in longing to meet with Him.

4) In the four directions a fickle wind blows the trees back and forth. Waves of drizzling rain fill the worlds.

5) The fair gopi follows the path to Krsna's abode. She comes to the doors of house after house.

6) Finally the beautiful fortunate gopi friend meets Krsna in the forest. How glorified Their union is! Govinda dasa respectfully stays far far away.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is sung in Raga Sindhura Gandhara.
