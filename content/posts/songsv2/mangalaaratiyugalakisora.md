**LYRICS:**

(1)

mangala aroti yugala kiśora

jaya jaya koratahi sakhī-gaṇa bhora

(2)

ratana pradīpa koru ṭalamala tora

nirakhata mukha vidhu śyāma sugaura

(3)

lalitā viśākhā sakhī preme agora

koroto niramanchan doñhe duhuń bhora

(4)

śrī vṛndāvana kuñja bhuvana ujora

mūrati manohara yugala kiśora

(5)

gāoete śuka pika nācata mor

cāńda upekhi mukha nirakhe cakora

(6)

bajata vividha yantra ghana ghora

śyāmānanda ānanda bajaya jaya tora

**TRANSLATION**

1) Their girlfriends (sakhis) are praising the youthful Divine Couple during Their Mangala Arati, singing jaya! jaya!

2) A jeweled lamp is being swung around as an offering to Radha-Krsna. The sakhis behold the moonlike faces of bluish Krsna and golden Radha.

3) The girlfriends Lalita and Visakha are absorbed in feelings of love. They are absorbed in worshipping both Radha and Krsna (with this mangala arati\-ceremony). The forest grove in Vrndavan beautifies the whole world. Along with the enchanting form of the divine youthful Couple Radha and Krsna.

4) The parrots and the cuckoos sing and the peacocks dance in Vrndavan. The Cakora\-birds reject their beloved moon to stare at the beautiful faces of Radha and Krsna.

5) Many kinds of musical instruments are being played busily. Syamananda blissfully plays them for the divine Couple.
