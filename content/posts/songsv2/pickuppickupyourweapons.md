**LYRICS:**

(1)

Pick up pick up your weapons O My friends.

Thrust and parry now with sharpened swords

Of clever playful glistening joking words.

O soldiers, on this fight so much depends.

(2)

O expert sharp-tongued slender archers, fire

A thundering great monsoon shower of arrows,

Arrows of joking rebukes Push a host of sorrows

On the smiling pleasant charming handsome liar

(3)

Krsna, the rake with glistening dancing eyes

And nectar honey smiles who aspires to attack

Us with javelins of joking rebukes Friends fight Him back.

With arrows surround Him and catch Him by surprise.

(4)

The handsome playful rake has come to tease

Us with His glistening words Now fight Him please.
