**TRANSLATION**

1) Sri Nityananda Prabhu is the embodiment of eternal bliss. He is the moon of all avadhutas and the beloved of the life-breath of Vasudha (His wife). Lord Nityananda is the husband, enthusing Jahnavi with life. Nityananda Rama bestows ecstatic love for Krishna and He is the Lord and Master of the devotees.

2) Sri Nityananda is the dear son of Padmavati and He is full of splendorous transcendental majesty. Nitai is the older brother of Sacimata's son Nimai. Nityananda Avadhuta is maddened in overwhelming ecstatic emotions. Sri Nityananda Prabhu is the savior of the universe. His complexion is golden tinged with red.

  
3-4) That person who recites these twelve auspicious holy names of the moonlike Nityananda-candra every day upon arising in the morning such a person becomes free from all difficulties and attains all their most cherished desires. Very soon they become the object of Lord Caitanya-deva's mercy.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This chant can sometimes have the refrain of “nitāi rāma” after every verse.
