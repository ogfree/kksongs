**LYRICS:**

(1)

jagannātha he, kichi māgu nāhiń muń tote

māgunāhiń dhana, māgunāhiń jana

māguchi śaradha bāliru hāte

(2)

āna daraśana na loḍe nayan eka tumbhe dekhā binā

suṇibāku kāna nāicche āna tumbha carite kāmanā

(3)

jihva na bāñchai grāmya gāibāku rajanī divasa

tumbha nāmabala kebaḷa sankhāḷi hoi thāo pītavāsa

(4)

nāsā mora tṛpti labhai āna subāsa dravya āghrāṇe

tava chaḍā māla tulasī kusuma candana karpūra dhyāne

(5)

mo hasta anguli rāma vanamāli japuthāu hare kṛṣṇa

kahe sālabega jatire yavana to tīrthe jāu mo prāṇa

**TRANSLATION**

1) O Jagannatha, I ask nothing from You - neither wealth, neither followers. I aamm only asking for one forearm's length of land at Saradha Bali.

2) My eyes want nothing other than to see Your beautiful form. My ears want nothing other than to hear the recitation of Your songs.

3) Neither by day or night does this tongue want to sing mundane songs. O Pitavasa, O Lord Jagannatha, who wears yellow garments, chanting Your holy name is my only last hope.

4) My nose is not interested in the smells of this world. It only wants to relish the fragrance of Your prasadi-garlands, tulasi, flowers, sandalwood paste and camphor.

5) O Rama Vanamali, O Flute-playing Krsna, who gives pleasure to His devotees, my fingers want only to be engaged in the japa of 'Hare Krsna'. Salabega, of lowborn caste, pleads to give up his body in the holy land of Jagannatha Puri.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

Verse 1 describes “Saradha Bali.” It is the forearm's length of land is just enough space to sit down. Saradha Bali is where the Lord's chariot waits near Gundica between the two Rathayatras.

This song was also translated by Gopala Jiu and printed in the fourth issue of Sri Krishna Kathamrita magazine entitled, "The Confidential Meaning of Ratha-yatra".
