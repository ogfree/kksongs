**TRANSLATION**

1-6) Those who are wise regarding transcendental mellows describe certain things which stimulate the awakening of limitless ecstatic emotions. These things are called uddipana, and are borne of the relationship between Krsna and His devotees. There are six categories of uddipanas known as: 1) guna (personal qualities), 2) nama (holy names), 3) carita (characteristic activities), 4) mandana (bodily adornments), 5) sambandhi (related paraphernalia), and 6) tatastha (natural phenomena). 1) guna (personal qualities): there are three types of personal qualities which stimulate ecstatic love for Krsna - those which are of the body, of the mind, and of the words. 2) nama (holy names): there are innumerable name-stimulants such as Krsna, Sri Radha-Madhava, etc. 3) carita (characteristic activities): stimulants such as Krsna's ecstatic dancing, flute-playing, singing, mode of walking, method of milking the cows, how he calls His cows personally, His lifting of the Govardhana hill, and His specially wild, frantic dances with the cowherd boys out in the pasturelands. 4) mandana (bodily adornments): there are four types of bodily adornments by which Krsna is beautified --- A) flower decorations such as garlands, earrings, crowns, etc. B) substances that are smeared such as ground sandalwood pulp, various oils and perfumes, etc. C) different types of exotic clothing, sashes and scarves, etc. D) ornaments such as anklebells, belts, medallions, bangles, armlets, and crowns, made from precious metals and jewels, etc. 5) sambandhi (related paraphernalia): assorted stimulants include the tooting of His flute, the bugling of His buffalo horn, the sound of His lute-playing (vina), the technique of the songs He composes, His creativity of design in arts and crafts, His all-pervading bodily fragrance, His footprints, the sound of His ornaments tinkling, the sound of various other musical instruments He plays, the peacock feathers He wears in His crown or holds in His hand, His cows, His bejeweled walking stick, His collection of flutes made from various materials, assorted buffalo horns, the sight of His dear most friends, the colorful minerals from Govardhana hill which the boys smear on themselves, forest flower garlands, the dust raised from the cows' hooves, and various places of pastimes that are sheltered in Vrndavana such as Govardhana hill, the Yamuna river (who is the Daughter of the Sun), the place of the rasa dance, and many other locations of pastimes, as well as large birds like peacocks and cranes, etc., bumblebees humming His glories, she- and he-deer, forest bowers, Tulasi trees, clusters of creepers, bright marigold plants, trees such as the kadamba and others --- all these things are the naturally beautiful opulences of the Vrndavana forest which stimulate the most beautiful ecstatic mellows. This is due to the direct relationship of all these things with Krsna and His eternal pastimes.  6) tatastha (natural phenomena): other stimulants include the Vrndavana moonlight, the clouds, the lightning of the rainy season, the full moon of the autumn season, the sweetly-scented breeze, and small birds like sparrows and finches, etc. --- all these natural opulences together produce a favorable situation just to enable Radha-Krsna and Their devotees to fully relish the most tasty mellows.
