(refrain)

sira dhara maṭakiyā ḍole re

“koī śyāma manohara lo re!

more koī śyāma manohara lo re”

(1)

dadhi ko nāma bisara gayī gwālana

“hari lo! hari lo!” bole re

(2)

kṛṣṇa ke rūpa chaki hai gwālana

“āo re hi āo re!” bole re

(3)

mīrā ke prabhu giridhara nāgara

ceri bhayi bin mole re

**TRANSLATION**

Refrain: The cowherd girls are carrying butter pots on their heads singing, “Please take the all-attractive blackish boy, Syama from us.”

1) The cowherd girls went to sell milk, but instead said, “Take Hari! Take Hari!”

2) The form of Krsna is fixed on the minds of the cowherd girls. “Come here! O come here!” said the girls.

3) The lord of Mira Bai is the courtly Giridhara, the lifter of Govardhana Hill. Her entire persona comes without a price only for Him.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This thumri bhajan is to be rendered in Raga Bhairavi in bhajani tala.
