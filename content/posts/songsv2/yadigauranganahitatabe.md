**LYRICS:**

(1)

(yadi) gaurāńga nahita, tabe ki haita,

kemane dharita de?

rādhāra mahimā, prema-rasa-sīmā,

jagate jānāta ke

(2)

madhura vṛndā-vipina-mādhurī-praveśa cāturī sāra

varaja-yuvati-bhāvera bhakati, śakati haita kā’ra

(3)

gāo punaḥ punaḥ, gaurāńgera guṇa,

sarala haiyā mana

e bhava-sāgare, emana dayāla,

nā dekhi je eka-jana

(4)

gaurāńga baliyā, nā genu galiyā,

kemane dharinu de

narahari-hiyā, pāṣāṇa diyā,

kemane gaḍiyāche

**TRANSLATION**

1) If Sriman Gauranga Mahaprabhu had not appeared, then what would have become of us? How could we have tolerated living? In this universe who would have ever come to know the glories of Srimati Radharani and the topmost limit of prema-rasa?

2) If Caitanya Mahaprabhu had not come, who could have had the intelligence to join the sweet madhura-rasa of Sri Radha-Krsna’s lilas in Vrndavana? Who else could have given the power to enter the vraja-ramanis’ loving mood of seva to yugala-kisora?

3) With a simple heart sing over and over again of Sri Gauranga’s glorious qualities! No one has ever seen such a compassionate person as He in the entire ocean of material existence.

4) Even though I chant Gauranga’s name, qualities and pastimes, somehow my heart has not melted – how do I continue to maintain the burden of this body? How is it that the Lord has created the body of Narahari, giving a stone in place of a heart?
