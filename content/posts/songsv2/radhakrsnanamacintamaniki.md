**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) O mind! Always chant the names of Radha and Krsna, which are fabulous gems that satisfy all desires.

1) By the mercy of Sri Gurudeva you have received these holy names. So go on chanting them, being filled with thoughts of their glories!

2) These names are sweet and blissful and are the full, eternal manifestation of the Supreme Lord. Be peaceful and satisfied and don’t think that you require anything else.

3) Just chant, all the time sprinkling upon your head the water of this understanding: There is no difference between these names and Radha-Krishna themselves.

4) Whether sleeping or awake, in a clean or unclean condition, remember these names again and again.

5) The essence of these holy names is the ecstatic rapture of prema-bhakti. Don’t consider it to be anything else.

6) Such names you have gotten that if you really understand your good fortune you will jump up and down, slapping your sides with your elbows out of happiness!

7) Gopal Krsna Dasa got this opportunity in his life! O my mind, wherever you may go and whatever you may do, always chant these holy names!
