**LYRICS:**

(1)

guru duru bañca ujorala canda

gurujana nayana padahi pada phanda

(2)

tāhe ati duratara pantha sañcāra

tatahi kalābatī calu abhisāra

(3)

ki kahaba mādhaba premaka rīta

tuyā anurāgiṇī tri-bhubana jita

(4)

yāhā dhanī dhādhase bhāńa dhunāna

sādhase dhā-oye katahu pāñcabāṇa

so tohe kuñje milala nirabādha

gobinda-dāsa hake pūrala sādha

**TRANSLATION**

1) The moon is bright. Now the eyes of her elders are spread like a net to catch her.

2) She walks on the frightening path. This graceful girl hurries to meet You.

3) O Krsna, how can I describe the love she bears for You? Her love for You eclipses the three worlds.

4) The beautiful agitated girl knits her eyebrows. How many times does Kamadeva attack with his five arrows?

5) O Krsna, now she meets You in the forest. Now her desires are all fulfilled.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is sung in Raga Bhupali.
