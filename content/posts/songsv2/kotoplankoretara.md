**LYRICS:**

(1)

koto _plan_ kore tārā bhālo thākibāre

prakṛti bhāńgiyā deya saba bāre bāre

(2)

“daivī hy eṣā guṇa mayī” bhagavāner māyā

“bhālo thākāra” artha bujha bhālo ko’re bhāyā

(3)

keho bhālo nāi hethā tabu bhālo bole

ei bhāve māyā saba baddha jīve chale

(4)

chalanāya bhuli jīva sarvadā majgula

māyā lāgi māre tabu bhāńge nāko bhula

**TRANSLATION**

1) How many “plans” are being made to live “fine.” The material nature, however, destroys them, again and again.

2) The transcendental energy consists of three modes of material energy is Lord’s māyā. O brothers! Please try to understand the definition of “doing fine.”

3) Nobody is truly fine here in the material one, though people still claim that they are “fine.” With this mood, the spirit souls trapped by māyā cheats them all.

4) By that cheating, they are forgetting that they are always engrossed in the illusion. Even though māyā kicks the soul, the spirit soul does not break its forgetfulness.
