**LYRICS:**

(Refrain)

mādhaba ki kahaba daiba-bipāka

patha-āgamana kathā      kata nā kahiba he

yadi haya mukha lākhe lākha

(1)

mandira teja yāba          pada cāri ā-olu

niśi heri kampita ańga

timira duranta patha          hera-i nā pāriye

pada-yuga beḍhala bhujańga

(2)

eke kula-kāminī       tāhe kuhu-yāminī

ghora gahana ati dūra

ā;re tahe jaladhara       barakhiye jhara jhara

hāma yā-oba kona pūra

(3)

eke pada-pańkaja      pańke bibhūṣita

kaṇṭake jarajara bhela

tuyā daraśana āśe        kachu nāhi jānalu

cira-dukha aba dūre gela

(4)

tohāri muralī yaba         śrabaṇe prabeśala

choḍalu gṛha-sukha āśa

pantha dukha tṛṇahu      kari nā gaṇalu

kahatahi gobinda-dāsa

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) O Krsna, how can I describe my fate? How many calamities fell on me as I walked here on the path? Even if I had millions and millions of mouths, I could not describe them all.

1) Leaving my house, I began walking here. When I saw night fall, my body trembled. Great darkness made the path impassable. I had no power to see anything. Snakes slithered about my feet.

2) I was all alone. The night was fearful. The path was very long. Then clouds rained and rained. Every place was flooded. Where could I go?

3) My lotus feet became adorned with mud. Again and again I was pricked by thorns. I yearned to see You. I didn't know where to go. Then my long sufferings fled far away.

4) The sound of Your flute-music entered my ears. Then I turned away from any wish to be happy in my home. Now I think all the troubles I met on that path to be insignificant like a blade of grass. So says Govinda dasa.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is sung in Raga Dhanasri.
