**LYRICS**

(1)

job koru kheli āli saiya bālā

heralu pathe janu cānda ki mālā

aparupa rupa nayane majhu lāgi

anukhan mādhurī maramahi jāgi

(2)

e sakhi e sakhi mohe heri rāi

vihasi rahali dhani gīma morāi

so mukha jhalamala niramala jyoti

lolita nāsika veśara moti

(3)

rangima jād vithāralo pīṭh

cakitahi majhu mana lāgalo dīṭh

aiche sukeśinī hām nāhi pekhi

cita mūrati hiye rahalahi lekhi

(4)

pada-nakha angulī yāvaka śobhā

daśa cāñd aruṇa bahu lobhā

so pada kamala hṛdaya kori seva

govinda dāsa yaba anumati debo

**TRANSLATION**

1-4) When I saw Radha playing with Her girlfriends, The path became lit, As if there appeared a garland of moons. The ravishing beauty of Her shape, Is frolicking with my eyes. Its sweetness constantly rouses within My heart. I called to Her, “O friend! O friend!” Rai stayed there, turning Her neck to look at Me, She smiled. How remarkable the pure light emanated from Her radiant face, As a dangling pearl hung from Her nose! The twisting and turning colorful tassels from Her braid, That reach down to Her buttocks, Makes My mind and eyes restless. As well as I’ve never ever, beheld such beautiful curly hair! Her enchanting form is painted on My mind. The ten red moons of Her toes, And the sun of her red lac\-painted foot soles, Increases my desire for Her! Govinda dasa says, “Let me serve these lotus feet within my heart, as soon as She gives me Her permission.”
