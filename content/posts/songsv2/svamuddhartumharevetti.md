**TRANSLATION**

1) Does an animal fallen into a well know how to lift itself out, O Hari? By beatings of its limbs, and repeated cries, it causes mercy, O Lord.

2) And even if it is unwilling, its limbs are targeted with a lasso; thus slowly bound, so also, the Supreme Hari lifts His own people (from worldly existence).

3) That Hari wipes away the mud, washes, and nurtures the animal; removes its collected sufferings with medicine and incantations.

4) So also, I am an animal-like human suffering in the world-well, my Lord; O Hari!  You who are Kesava, the killer of Kesi, rescue me from myriad flaws.

5) In order to make me a walking corpse are engaged various villains; having killed them soon, O Hari, select me for your service.

6) Internal enemies such as lust, etc., and eternal enemies as well; having removed the fear of these, you who are fearful to asuras, give me joy as you did to Prahlada.

7) Anxieties, diseases, women, kings, traitors, and bad people other than these; destroy them soon, my Omniscient, Omnipotent Hari!

8) Pulverize Kali, and punish his followers, my Hari; purify the mind, place noble precepts therein, and give me the desirable.

9) This prayer called Haryastakam stated by the saint Sri Vadiraja Tirtha; upon reading the same one's enemies are destroyed instantly by Lord Nrsimha's grace.
