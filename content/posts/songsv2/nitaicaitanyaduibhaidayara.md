(1)

nitāi caitanya duī bhāi dayāra abadhi

śiba brahmāra durlabha prema yāce nirabadhi

(2)

cāri bede anveṣaye ye prema pā-ite

hena prema duī bhā-i yāce abirate

(3)

patita durgata yata kali-hata yārā

nitāi caitanya bali nāce gāya tārā

(4)

bhubana-mańgala bhela sańkīrtana-rase

rāya ananta kānde nā pā-iyā śeṣe

**TRANSLATION**

1) The two brothers Nitai and Caitanya are the most merciful. Again and again They beg the people to please accept the rare ecstatic spiritual love even Brahma and Siva cannot attain.

2) Again and again these two brothers beg the people to please accept the rare ecstatic spiritual love the four Vedas seek.

3) Not even the fallen misled sinners, sinners wounded by Kali-yuga, chant “Nitai! Caitanya!” and dance.

4) Now the world has become auspicious. Now the world is flooded with the nectar of sankirtana. Alas! Ananta Raya weeps. He could not taste even a drop of that nectar.
