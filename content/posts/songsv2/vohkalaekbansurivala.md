**LYRICS:**

(refrain)

voh kālā ek bāńsurī vālā

sudha vīsarā gayā morī (re)

mākhana cora jo nanda kiśora voh

kargayo man kī corī (re)

(1)

pan ghaṭa pe morī baiyā maroḍī

maiń boli to merī maṭakī toḍī

baiyā paḍu karuń binatī meń par

māne nā ek voh morī (re)

(2)

chup gayo phir ek kāna sunāke

kahāń gayo ek bāna calāke

gokula ḍhunḍhā maine mathurā ḍhunḍhī

koī nagariyā nā choḍī re

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain): That blackish flute playing boy who left away. Our dear, that lad of Nanda Maharaja, is the thief of butter! Where did the thief of the mind go?

1) I checked at the banks of the Yamuna River, O dear, and I saw Krsna. If I say anything, He’ll break my clay pot. Oh dear sakhi, each time I try to plead and pray to Him, He will not be willing to listen.

2) Remain quiet and listen to Kana (a nickname of Krsna). Where did the archer who carries to bow go? I go to Goluka and search, as well as in Mathura. Which town did He go, which their fellow citizens would not Him go?
