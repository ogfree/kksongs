**LYRICS:**

(Refrain)

jasodā hari pālne jhūlāvai

(1)

halrāvai dulrāyi malhāvai joyi soyi kabu gāvai

(2)

mere lāl ko aḍanidariyā kāhe na āni sunāvai

tū kāhe nahibegahīn āvai tokau kānh bulāvai

(3)

kabhūn palak hari mund let haiń kabhūn adhar pharkāvai

sovata jāti maun hai kai rahi kari kari sain batāve

(4)

ihi antar akulāi uṭhe hari jasumat madhurai gāvai

jo sukh sūr amar muni duralabha so nanda bhāminī pāvai

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) Yasoda rocks Hari in His cradle!

1) Swaying it short and long, Yasoda sings short songs.

2) Sleep come from the skies into my darling’s eyes. Come quickly from skies. Harken to my darling’s cries.

3) When the Lord closes His eyes and His quivering lips, reveal the secret to the world that He is not truly asleep!

4) His body shudders with pleasure to the phrases of Yasoda’s sweet song, The happiness Sura Dasa knows no measure. Obtaining this activity, which is rare even for munis, is being given to Nanda Maharaja’s queen.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is rendered in Raga Misra Pilu. This song is popularized in the B.R. Chopra’s 1988 Mahabharata serial sung by Anuradha Paudwal during the Krsna lila episodes.
