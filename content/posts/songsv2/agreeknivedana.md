(1)

hari he

agre eka nibedana kori madhunisūdana

śuno kṛpā koriyā āmāya

nirarthaka kathā noya nigūḍhārtha-moya hoya

hṛdoyā hoite bahirāya

(2)

ati aprakṛṣṭa āmi        parama doyālu tumi

taba doyā mora adhikāra

je jata patita hoya      taba doyā tata tāya

ta'te āmi su-pātra doyāra

(3)

more jodi upekhibe       doyā-pātre kothā pābe

doyāmoya nāmaṭi ghucā'be

e bhaktibinoda koya      doyā koro doyāmoya

jaśa-kīrti ciro-dina pā'be

**TRANSLATION**

1) Oh my dear Lord Hari! I have just one appeal to make before You, oh killer of the Madhu demon! Please be kind enough to hear it from me. It is certainly not a useless talk for wasting time, for it is full of very deep meaning. Indeed, it is welling up from the very depths of my heart.

2) I am most degraded, and You are most merciful; therefore I have full rights to stake a claim for Your mercy. For no matter how fallen I could possibly be, Your mercy easily extends to that degree; therefore I am quite a suitable candidate for receiving Your causeless mercy.

3) If You were to neglect my appeal, then Your famous name as "the Most Merciful" would become null and void. And then where else could this recipient go to find the same kind of mercy? Bhaktivinoda says, please be merciful, oh Most Merciful! If You would do this, then Your fame and glories will go on unblemished for all of time to come.
