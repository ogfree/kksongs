**LYRICS:**

(1)

jaya jaya sri-nabadvipa-sudhakara prabhu bisvambhara deva

jaya padmabati-nandana pahum majhu jaya basu jahnabi seba

(2)

jaya jaya sri-advaita sita-pati sukhada santipura canda

jaya jaya srila gadadhara pandita rasamaya ananda kanda

(3)

jaya malini-pati  sadaya-hrdaya ati pandita sribasa udara

gaura-bhakata jaya  parama dayamaya sire dhari carana sabara

(4)  
iha saba bhubane prema-rasa-sincane purala jaga-jana asa

apana karama\-dose bancita bhela duramati baisnaba dasa

**TRANSLATION**

1) Glory, glory to Lord Visvambharadeva, the nectar moon of Navadvipa! Glory, glory to Lord Nityananda, who delights Padmavati and is served by Jahnavi!

2) Glory, glory to Sri Advaita, Sita's husband who is a moon bringing happiness to Santipura! Glory, glory to Srila Gadadhara Pandita, who is the sweet root of transcendental bliss!

3) Glory to generous Srivasa Pandita, Malini's kind-hearted husband! Glory to the supremely kind devotees of Lord Gaura! The feet of every one of them I place upon my head.

4) All of the worlds are now flooded with a nectar monsoon of spiritual love. Now are fulfilled the desires of every person in this world. Only wretched Vaisnava dasa has been cheated of that nectar, cheated because of his past impious deeds.
