**LYRICS:**

(1)

prabhura bacana          takhana śuniyā

śrībāsa loṭāñā bhūmi

bole śuno nātha          taba rasa-bhańga

sahite nā pāri āmi

(2)

ekaṭi tanaya        mariyāche nātha

tāhe mora kiba duḥkha

jadi saba mare      tomāre heriyā

tabu to' pāibo sukha

(3)

taba nṛtya-bhańga        hoile āmāra

maraṇa hoite hari

tāi ku-sambāda      nā dilo tomāre

bipada āśańkā kori'

(4)

ebe ājñā deho       mṛta suta lo'ye

satkāra koruna sabe

eteka śuniyā        gorā dwija-maṇi

kāndite lagilo tabe

(5)

kemone e saba       chāḍiyā jāibo

paraṇa bikala hoya

se kathā śuniyā          bhakatibinoda

manete pāilo bhoya

**TRANSLATION**

1) Then, hearing these words of the Lord, Srivasa Pandita began rolling on the ground, crying out, "Please hear me, oh Lord! I am simply not able to tolerate any disturbance or interruption of the ecstatic mellows of Your kirtana!"

2) "Only one of my sons has died, oh Lord, and has that really made me upset? Even if all of my sons die, then I will certainly get more than enough happiness by seeing You."

3) "I would certainly die on the spot if I were to interrupt Your dancing, oh Lord. That is why I did not inform You of this bad news. For I was dreading the calamity of disturbing Your ecstasy."

4) "Lord, if You will kindly grant us Your permission now, then we shall all take the boy's body and perform the proper funeral rites." Hearing this much from the mouth of Srivasa Pandita, the jewel of the twice-born, Lord Gaurasundara, then broke down and began to weep piteously on the spot.

5) Crying and crying, the Lord thought within Himself, "How could I possibly abandon such loving servitors and go elsewhere by taking sannyasa? If I were to do so, my heart would certainly split." Hearing this type of talk, Bhaktivinoda's mind become somewhat fearful.
