**TRANSLATION**

1) O Krsna, after killing the demon Vatsasura, You threw him into a kapittha tree and caused the ripe kapittha fruits to fall to the ground. You then became jubilant, the cowherd boys glorified You and the demigods worshiped You by showering flowers.

2) O Krsna, You amaze the cowherd boys, and You become the object of their constant meditation. Covered with the dust upraised by the cows, You return home in the evening. O Lord, please protect me.

3) O Krsna, Ornamented with garlands of gunja and a garland of peacock feather, wearing flower-earrings and sumana flowers on Your head, You take pleasure in playing a flute made from a leaf.

4) O Krsna, You are crown with peacock feathers and blossoming flowers and garlanded with forest-flowers. Your limbs are decorated with wonderful pictures and designs drawn in colorful mineral pigments gathered in the forest.
