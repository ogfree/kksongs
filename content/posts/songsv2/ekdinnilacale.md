bhāi-re!

eka-dina nīlācale,  prasād-sevana-kāle,

bolilen bhakta-gaṇe,  khecarānna śuddha-mane,

sevā kori’ hao āj dhanya

khecarānna piṭhā-pānā,  apūrva prasāda nānā,

jagannātha dilo tomā sabe

ākanṭha bhojana kori’,  bolo mukhe \`hari hari’,

jagannātha-prasādānna,  viriñci-śambhura mānya,

khāile prema hoibe udoy

emona durlabha dhana,  pāiyācho sarva-jana,

jaya jaya jagannātha jay

**TRANSLATION**

1) O brothers! One day in Jagannatha Puri, at the time of honoring the Lord's prasad, Mahaprabhu Sri Krsna Caitanya said to all the devotees, "May you become blessed on this day by honoring the khicari of the Lord in a pure state of mind.

2) "Lord Jagannatha has given you varieties of extraordinary and wonderful prasad, such as khicuri and pitha-pana (a type of cake and condensed-milk preparation). Therefore, take all of this prasad until you are filled up to the neck, and with your voices chant \`Hari! Hari!' In such a transcendental atmosphere, ignorance and sin cannot remain.

3) "These prasad food-grains of Lord Jagannatha are worshipable even by Lord Brahma and Lord Siva. Upon the eating of it, love of God arises within the heart. All of you have obtained such a rare treasure. All glories! All glories! All glories to Lord Jagannatha!"

**Remarks/ Extra Information****:**

This song is sung while honoring khicari prasadam.
