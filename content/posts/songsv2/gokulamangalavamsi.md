**LYRICS**

(Refrain)

gokula-mańgala-vaḿśī-

dhvanir udgarjati vana-gataye smara-bhūpati-śāsana\-śaḿsī

soḍhum ahaḿ samayasya na samprati śaktā lavam api pātam

mādhava-caraṇāńguṣṭha-nakha-dyutir ayam udayati hima-dhāmā

mā gurujana-bhayam udgira muhur iyam abhavaḿ dhāvita-kāmā

(3)

taḿ sevitum iha paśya sanātana-paramāraṇya-javeśam

gopa-vadhū-tatir iyam upasarpati bhānu-sutā-taṭa-deśam

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) The flute that brings auspiciousness to Gokula now thunders King Kamadeva's order to go to the forest.

1) Why do you make a delay with these superfluous decorations? I cannot tolerate even a moment's delay!

2) "Madhava's toenails are very splendid." “The moon is now rising!" "Don't tell me again and again how I should fear my superiors! I yearn to run to Madhava!"

3) Look! The gopis are all going to the Yamuna's shore to serve Madhava, who is always handsomely decorated with forest flowers.

**Remarks/ Extra Information****:**

Srila Jiva Gosvami explains that a gopi eagerly desiring to meet Krsna at an appointed rendezvous sings this song to a gopi friend engaged in decorating her.

This song is to be sung in Carnatic Raga Karnata.
