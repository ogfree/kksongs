**LYRICS**

(1)

Alas for those who spend their days  
In festive mirth and joy.  
The dazzling, deadly, liquid forms  
Their hearts fore'er employ.

(2)  
The shining bottles charm their eyes  
And draw their heart's embrace;  
The slaves of wine can never rise  
From what we call disgrace.

(3)  
Was man intended to be  
A brute in work and heart?  
Should man, the Lord of all around,  
From common sense depart?

(4)  
Man's glory is in common sense  
Dictating us the grace,  
That man is made to live and love  
The beauteous Heaven's embrace.

(5)  
The flesh is not our own alas;  
The mortal frame a chain;  
The soul confined for former wrongs  
Should try to rise again.

(6)  
Why then this childish play in that  
Which cannot be our own;  
Which falls within a hundred years  
As if a rose ablown.

(7)  
Our life is but a rosy hue  
To go ere long for naught;  
The soul alone would last fore'er  
With good or evil fraught.

(8)  
How deep the thought of times to be!  
How grave the aspect looks!  
And wrapt in awe become, O, we,  
When reading Nature's books.

(9)  
Man's life to him a problem dark -  
A screen both left and right;  
No soul hath come to tell us what  
Exists beyond our sight.

(10)  
But then a voice, how deep and soft;  
Within ourselves is left;  
Man! Man! Thou art immortal soul!  
Thee Death can never melt.

(11)  
For Thee Thy Sire on High has kept  
A store of bliss above,  
To end of time, thou art Oh! His -  
Who wants but purest love.

(12)  
O Love! Thy power and spell benign  
Now melt my soul to God;  
How can my earthly words describe  
That feeling soft and broad.

(13)  
Enjoyment, sorrow - what but lots  
To which the flesh is heir?  
The soul that sleeps alone concludes  
In them it hath a share.

(14)  
And then, my friends, no more enjoy  
Nor weep for all below;  
The women, wine, and flesh of beasts  
No love on thee bestow.

(15)  
But thine to love thy brother man  
And give thyself to God,  
And God doth know your wages fair -  
This fact is true and broad.

(16)  
Forget the past that sleeps and ne'er  
The future dream at all  
But act in times that are with thee  
And progress thee shall call.

(17)  
But tell me not in reasoning cold,  
The soul is made alone  
By earth's mechanic lifeless rules  
And to destruction prone.

(18)  
My God who gave us life and all  
Alone the soul can kill  
Or give it all the joys above  
His promise to fulfill.

(19)  
So push thy onward march, O soul,  
Against an evil deed  
That stands with soldiers Hate and Lust -  
A hero be indeed.

(20)  
Maintain thy post in spirit world  
As firmly as you can  
Let never matter push thee down -  
O stand heroic man.

(21)  
O Sharagrahi Vaisnava soul  
Thou art an angel fair;  
Lead, lead me on to Vrndaban  
And spirit's power declare.

(22)  
There rests my soul from matter free  
Upon my Lover's arms  
Eternal peace and spirits love  
Are all my chanting charms.
