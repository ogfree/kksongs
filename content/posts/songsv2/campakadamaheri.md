**LYRICS:**

(1)

campaka dāma heri mūrachi rahu mādhaba

locana jharu anurāga

tuyā guṇa-mantara        japaye nirantara

bhāle dhani tohāri sohāga

(2)

bṛṣabhānu-nandinī japaye rāti dini

bharame nā bolaye āna

lākha lākha dhanī        kaha-i madhura bāṇī

swpaane nā pāta-i kāna

(3)

puruṣa-ratana baradharaṇi loṭā-ota

ko kahu ārati-ora

rā bali dhā balibala-i nā pāra-i

dhārādhāra bahe lora

(4)

gobinda dāsa tuyā caraṇe nibedala

kānuko aichana sambāda

nicaya jānaha  tachu duḥkha-khaṇḍaka

kebala tuyā parasāda

**TRANSLATION**

1)  When He saw Your campaka garland, Krsna was overcome. Tears of love streamed from His eyes. Without stop He chants the mantra of Your glories. My dear beautiful friend, He loves You deeply.

2) O daughter of Vrsabhanu, He chants the mantras of Your glories day and night. He does not glorify any other girl. Millions and millions of girls praise Him with sweet words, but even in His dreams Krsna does not love any girl but You.

3)  He is the jewel of men, the best of lovers. Overcome with love for You, He rolls on the ground. Does He love another girl? He chants, "Ra!" Then He chants, "Dha!" Then He is overcome and He has no power to say anything more. Then flooding streams of tears flow from His eyes.

4) Govinda dasa falls at Your feet and makes this request. Please give to Krsna a reply that will show mercy to Him, a reply that will break His sufferings into pieces.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is sung in Raga Bala.
