**LYRICS:**

(1)

gurudev!

baḍi kṛpā kari, gauḍa-vana mājhe,

godrume meń diyā sthāna

ājñā di mujhako,  vraja meń basike,

hari-nāma kara gāna

(2)

lekin kaba prabhu,  samaratha doge,

dāsa pe dayā hogi

citta sthira hoye, ho sahana śīla,

nāma sādhanā hogi

(3)

śaiśava-yauvan,  jaḍa-sukha-sańge,

abhyāsa paḍā manda

nija-karma-doṣa se,  yeh tana yatanā,

bhajana meń pratibandha

(4)

ab hai vārdhakya,  huwā asakya,

kaise karūń sādhanā

ro ro kara prabhu,  tere caraṇa meń,

karata hūń vandanā

**TRANSLATION**

1) Gurudeva! Because you are so merciful, you gave me a place in Godruma amid the woodlands of Gauda, with this order to fulfill: “Dwell here in this Vrndavana and sing the holy name of Hari.”

2) But when, O master, out of your great mercy, will you bestow upon this servant of yours the spiritual competence to fulfill that order? When will my mind become tranquil and fixed? When will I endure all hardships and serve Lord Hari without distractions?

3) Due to attachment to worldly pleasures in childhood and youth, I have developed bad habits. Because of these sinful acts my body has become an impediment to the service of the Supreme Lord.

4) Now, in old age, afflicted by the five-fold illnesses, how will I serve the Lord? O master, please tell me. I have fallen at your feet weeping, overwhelmed by anxiety.
