purnima-pratipada-sandhi samaya pa-i

rahu garasala gagana-sasi

nimba-mahi-taru-tala-sutika-gehe

**TRANSLATION**

1) At the time of purnima-pratipada-sandhi, Rahu swallowed the moon in the sky. At that moment another moon, the moon of Lord Gaura, arose in a maternity-room on the earth, a maternity-room that was under a nim tree.

2) Effulgent infant Lord Gaura lit up the room. He shone like a hundred lamps. Leaving Svargaloka, the demigods and goddesses came to that maternity-room.

3) Thousand-eyed Indra, four-faced Brahma, six-faced Karttikeya, elephant-faced Ganesa, five-faced Siva, the four Maruts, Varuna, and Kuvera, the master of treasures, all came. They were filled with bliss.

4) Gazing at Lord Gaura's face, they felt very fortunate at heart. They bowed before Lord Gaura's feet. Gazing at her son, mother Saci was overcome with bliss in her heart.

5) In nthat maternity- room infant Lord’ Gaura's body shone like a hundred moons. Ghanasyama says: Seeing that newborn infant's glorious form, the whole world was enchanted. Every heart was filled with bliss.
