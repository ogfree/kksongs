(1)

darśana āśleṣanwita      ānukūlya sebāśrīta

ullāse ārūḍha jei bhāba

juba-dwandwa hṛdi mājhe       rasākāre su-birājye

sambhogākhya tāra hoya lābha

(2)

mukhya gauṇa dwi-prakāra      sambhogera su-bistāra

tad ubhoya cāriṭi prakāra

sańkhipta sańkīrṇa jāna        sampanna samṛddhimāna

pūrba bhābābasthā anusāra

(3)

pūrba-rāgāntare jāhā          sańkhipta sambhoga tāhā

mānāntare sańkīrṇa pramāṇe

khudra prabāsābasāne          sampanna samṛddhimāne

su-dūra prabāsa abasāne

(4)

sampanna dwi-bidha bhāba           āgati o prādurbhāba

manohara sambhoga tāhāya

swapne āi saba bhāba          jahe hoya ābirbhāba

tabe gauṇa sambhoga jānāya

**TRANSLATION**

1) Sambhoga is defined as follows: it is that ecstatic mutual mood between the young couple Radha and Krsna which is enhanced by looking at each other, by embracing, by worshipping and attending each other favorably, which surmounts the highest pinnacle of elated bliss, and which is present within both Their hearts as personified rasa. Such a mood of Theirs together is called sambhoga.

2) Sambhoga expands nicely into two main headings, mukhya (primary), and gauna (secondary). Both of these headings can each have four varieties of contacts, namely 1) samksipst (very brief and simple meeting), 2) samkirna (narrow --- slightly hindered by fear, etc.), 3) sampanna (affluent --- a warm loving meeting after a sojourn), and 4) samrddhimana sambhoga (fully enriched to the maximum). Each of these four types of union follows one of four types of separation as follows:

3) The systematic appearance of the four mukhya sambhogas are 1) samksipt sambhoga, occurs after purva\-raga (simple union after preliminary affection), 2) sankirna sambhoga occurs after mana (narrow union after pouting), 3) sampanna sambhoga occurs after a brief pravasa (affluent union after a short sojourn), and 4) samrddhimana sambhoga occurs after a long pravasa (fully enriched union after a long sojourn).

4) The sampanna sambhoga has two variations which produce very enchanting unions. They are two types of arrivals: 1) agati (formal or pre-arranged arrival) and 2) pradurbhava (sudden appearance among those who are eager). Also there are meetings and pastimes together in dreams. These factual dream-lilas come under the second heading as gauna sambhoga (secondary category of union).
