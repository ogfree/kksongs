**TRANSLATION**

Krsna is the lover of Radha, sweet like honey of the springtime, the husband of Laksmi, the awarder of liberation, the Lord of the gopis, He bewilders of Cupid, He relishes of the blissful mellows of the rasa dance, the enjoyer of amorous sports in the grove at Radha Kunda known as Ananga-sukhada-kunja, and the pleasure of the cows.
