(refrain)  
he govinda he gopāla  
he govinda rākho śarana  
ab to jīvana hāre

sindhu bīca basata grāha  
caraṇa dhari pachāre

śora bhayo bhāre  
sańkha cakra gadā padma  
garuḍa leyiń sidhāre

sūra kaha śyāma suno  
śaraṇa hai tihāre  
ab ki bāra pāra karo  
nanda ke dulāre

TRANSLATION  
**Refrain: Oh Lord of Cows, Govinda! O Protector of Cows, Gopala! O Govinda! Please protect me, for I have lost the battle of my life.

1) For the sake of drinking water, I went to the banks of a river. In the middle of the river resides a crocodile. The crocodile grabbed my feet with his sharp teeth.

2) I have battled with the crocodile for four hours and he dragged in the middle of the river.  As my nose and ears are being submerged into the water, I immediately call for Lord Krsna for help.

3) My cry and words reached Dvarka, and as a result, great commotion and noise resulted. But at once, with His conchshell, cakra, His mace, and the lotus flower, He immediately comes by with His vehicle Garuda.

4) Sura Dasa says, "Oh Lord Syama! Please hear my humble request. I surrender to Your lotus feet. Please deliver me, Oh Darling of Nanda Maharaja!"

**Remarks/ Extra Information****:**

Bhakti Caru Swami and Laksmi Shankar popularized this bhajan through their albums “Krsna Bhavanamrta Volume 1” in 1996 and “Mira Bhajans” in 1979, respectively. They both rendered it in Raga Ragesri in Dadra Tala.

A variation of Verse 3 is:

“dvāraka se cale gopāla

garuḍa ke bichāre

cakra se grahu ko māri

gajarāja ko uddhāre”

From the Dvarka, Gopala arrives on the back of his vulture-vehicle, Garuda. With His sudarsana disc, He killed the crocodile and redeemed the elephant, Gajendra.

This is sung as the elephant, Gajendra, per the pastime in the Srimad Bhagavatam.
