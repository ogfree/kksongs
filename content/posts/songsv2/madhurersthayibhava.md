(1)

madhurera sthāyī bhāba        labhe jate abirbhāba

boli tāhā śuno eka\-mane

abhijoga o biṣoya        sambandhābhimāna-dwoya

tadīya biśeṣa upamāne

(2)

swabhāba āśroya kori'         citte rati abatori

śṛńgāra rasera kore puṣṭi

abhijoga ādi choya       anye rati-hetu hoya

braja-debīra tāhe nāhi dṛṣṭi

(3)

swataḥ-siddhi rati tāńre      sambandhādi-sahākāre

samartha koriyā rākhe sadā

kṛṣṇa-sebā binā tāńra         udyamo nāhika āra

swīya sukha ceṣṭa nāhi kadā

(4)

ei rati prauḍha hoya          mahā-bhāba dāsa pāya

jāra tulya prāpti āra nāi

sarbādbhuta camatkāra         sambhogecchā e prakāra

barṇibāre bākya nāhi pāi

**TRANSLATION**

1) Madhura rati, or conjugal affection, is the stayi bhava of the madhura rasa. Now please hear with rapt attention as I explain the sequence of its development. The seven causal ingredients are: 1) Abhiyoga (expression of heartfelt emotions as joking complaints) 2) Visaya (the five sense perceptions of Krsna, namely sound, touch, form, taste and smell) 3) Sambandha (Krsna's relatives and family members) 4) Abhimana (the feeling that Krsna is one's own) 5) Tadiya Visesa (Krsna's personal specialties, like His footprints, favorite pastures, etc.) 6) Upama (poetic comparison of Krsna to other things) 7) Svabhava (love that arises naturally without external stimulus)

2) Rati develops in the heart of the practicing devotee when all these features act together under the shelter of the 7th ingredient svabhava, and thus the conjugal mellow becomes nourished. However, all the Vraja gopis have natural rati as their svabhava, so for them there is no need of stimulation by the first six above-mentioned ingredients headed by abhiyoga.

3) The natural, spontaneous transcendental rati of the gopis is so strongly fixed up that they merely take help from the above-mentioned six ingredients, instead of depending on them for stimulation. Except for Krsna's service, there is no question of their ever performing any other endeavor. Indeed, it is verily impossible for them to strive for their own personal happiness at any time, even to the slightest degree.

4) When this type of pure attachment becomes most matured, then the final stage it attains is called maha-bhava . . . the most exalted, sublime form of transcendental ecstasy. There is no comparison anywhere to such bliss. Their desire for this type of selfless union is the most wonderful thing to observe, and it really makes one astonished even to think of it. Therefore, I can certainly find no suitable words to describe the manifestation of this topmost divine grace called maha-bhava.
