**LYRICS:**

(introductory verse)

tan tambūrā tār man adbhuta hai yeh sāz

hari ke karte bajarā hari kī hai āwāz

(refrain)

tan ke tambūre meń do sāzoń ke tār bole

jaya sīyā rāma rāma, jaya rādhe śyām śyām

(1)

ab to is tan ke mandir meń prabhu kā huā baserā

magan huā mana mera chūṭā janama janama kā pherā

man kī muralīyā meń sur kā śṛńgār bole

jaya sīyā rāma rāma, jaya rādhe śyām śyām

(2)

lagana lagī līlādhārī se jagīre jagamaga jyotī

rāma nāma kā hīrā pāyā śyāma nāma kā motī

pyāsī do ańkhiyoń meń, āńsuwo ke dhāra bole

jaya sīyā rāma rāma, jaya rādhe śyām śyām

**TRANSLATION**

(Introductory verse): In the the mind of the body of the tanpura, here is a very unusual sound. The sound of Hari’s name that always plays in the tanpura is indeed no different from Hari’s voice!

(Refrain): In the tanpura of the body plays two notes from its strings: “Jaya Sita Rama Rama! Jaya Radhe Syam Syam!”

1) Now, in this temple of the body, the Lord is the eternal ruler. My mind has been attached to the Lord and broke the journey of birth after birth. The flute of my mind sings the adorned pitches: “Jaya Siya Rama Rama!” “Jaya Radhe Syam Syam.”

2) I feel so much attachment to the divine sporter that I have awaken to this radiant jeweled light. I have attained the jewel of Rama’s name and Syama’s name of pearl. These two thirsty eyes form a river of tears that sings, “Jaya Siya Rama Rama! Jaya Radhe Syam Syam!”
