**LYRICS:**

(1)

hari he

heno duṣṭa karma nāi       jaha āmi kori nāi

sahasra sahasra-bāra hori

sei saba-karma-phala          peye abasara bala

āmāya piśiche jantropori

(2)

gati nāhi dekhi āra      kānde hari anibāra

tomāra agrete ebe āmi

ja' tomāra hoya mane          daṇḍa deo akiñcane

tumi mora daṇḍa-dhara swāmī

(3)

kleśa-bhoga bhāgye jata       bhoga mora hao tata

kintu eka mama nibedana

je je daśā bhoga āmi          āmāke nā chāḍo swāmī

bhaktibinodera prāṇa-dhana

**TRANSLATION**

1) Oh my dear Lord Hari! There are not sinful activities which I have not performed thousands upon thousands of times! And by the fruits of all these sinful actions, I have become robbed of all strength, being helplessly taken for an excruciatingly painful ride on the machine of this material world.

2) Seeing no other hope for deliverance in sight, I am now continuously crying before You, my Lord. Please punish Your insignificant servant as You see befitting, for You are my Lord and ruling Master.

3) Whatever difficulty my destiny prescribes for me, I will gladly undergo, but I have just one appeal to make to You. My dear Lord, no matter what condition I must undergo, please never give me up, for You are the only treasure of Bhaktivinoda's life.
