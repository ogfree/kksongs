**LYRICS:**

(1)

hari he

tabāńghri-kamala-dwoya          bilāsa-bikrama-moya

parābara jagata byāpiyā

sarba-khaṇa bartamāna         bhakta-kleśa-abasāna

lagi' sadā prastuta hoiyā

(2)

jagatera sei dhana       āmi jaga-madhya-jana

ata eba sama adhikāra

āmi kibā bhāgya-hīna          sādhane bañcita dīna

ki kāja jībane āra chāra

(3)

kṛpā binā nāhi gati      e bhaktibinoda ati

dainya kori' bole prabhu pāya

kabe taba kṛpā pe'ye          uṭhibo sabale dhe'ye

heribo se pada-juga hāya

**TRANSLATION**

1) Oh my Lord Hari! Your twin lotus feet are full of mighty prowess in performing transcendental pastimes, which are constantly expanding daily throughout both the material and spiritual worlds. Such pastimes are eternally being performed just to mitigate all the sufferings of Your devotees. For this reason only are Your eightfold pastimes enacted.

2) Despite the presence of Your pastimes here, which are the real treasure of this universe, I am still bereft of all good fortune, for I have cheated myself out of worshiping Your lotus feet in devotional service. Thus I am most fallen, and there is no one else quite as fallen as me. What other activities could possibly be more sinful than those which were performed by me throughout my entire lifetime?

3) Now Bhaktivinoda, with the utmost humility says to You, oh Lord... without Your causeless mercy, I have no other refuge. Alas! When will I get Your kind favor? I will stand up and forcefully run for You, and then I will behold Your beautiful lotus feet with my very eyes.
