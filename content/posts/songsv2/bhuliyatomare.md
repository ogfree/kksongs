**LYRICS:**

(1)  
bhuliyā tomāre, saḿsāre āsiyā,  
peye nānā-vidha byathā  
tomāra caraṇe, āsiyāchi āmi,  
bolibo duḥkhera kathā

(2)  
jananī jaṭhare, chilāma jakhona,  
biṣama bandhana-pāśe  
eka-bāra prabhu! dekhā diyā more,  
vañcile e dīna dāse

(3)  
takhona bhāvinu, janama pāiyā,  
koribo bhajana tava  
janama hoilo, paḍi' māyā-jāle,  
nā hoilo jñāna-lava

(4)  
ādarera chele, sva-janera kole,  
hāsiyā kāṭānu kāla  
janaka jananī-snehete bhuliyā,  
saḿsāra lāgilo bhālo

(5)  
krame dina dina, bālaka hoiyā,  
bhelinu bālaka-saha  
āra kichu dine, jnāna upajilo,  
pāṭha poḍi ahar-ahaḥ

(6)  
vidyāra gaurave, bhrami' deśe deśe,  
dhana uparjana kori  
sva-jana pālana, kori eka-mane,  
bhulinu tomāre, hari!

(7)  
bārdhakye ekhona, bhakativinoda,  
kāṇdiyā kātara ati  
nā bhajiyā tore, dina bṛthā gelo,  
ekhona ki habe gati?

**TRANSLATION**

1) I forsook You, O Lord, and came to this world of pain and sorrow. Now I submit my tale of woe at Your lotus feet.

2) While still in the unbearable fetters of my mother’s womb, I saw You before me You revealed Yourself but briefly and then abandoned this poor servant of Yours.

3) At that moment I swore to worship You after taking birth; but birth came, and with it the network of worldly illusion which robbed me of all good sense.

4) As a fondled son in the lap of relatives, I passed my time smiling and laughing. My parents’ affection helped me to forget the pangs of birth, and I thought the world was very nice.

5) Day by day I grew and soon began playing with other boys. Shortly my powers of understanding emerged. I read and studied my lessons incessantly.

6) Travelling from place to place, proud of my education, I grew wealthy and maintained my family with undivided attention. O Lord Hari, I forgot You!

7) Now in old age, Bhaktivinoda is sad. He weeps. I failed to worship You, O Lord, and instead passed my life in vain. What will be my fate now?
