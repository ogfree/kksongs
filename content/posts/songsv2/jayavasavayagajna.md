**TRANSLATION**

1) O Lord Krsna, all glories unto You. You asked Your father why he was performing a sacrifice, although You knew full well the sacrifice was to be offered to Lord Indra. When You heard Your father's description of the sacrifice's purpose, You replied by speaking the karma-mimamsa philosophy (Which states that if one works nicely, he will get the good result of his work, and there is no need of God.

2) O Lord Krsna, by presenting many different false and illogical arguments, You prohibited the performs of the sacrifice to Indra, and urged (the cowherd men) to perform a sacrifice for the cows and Govardhana Hill. O Lord, I offer respectful obeisances unto You.

3) O Lord krsna, You described how the sacrifice for Govardhana Hill and the cows should be performed, and when the sacrifice was performed, You assumed a separately constituted gigantic form, claiming to be Govardhana Hill and eating the foodstuffs offered in the sacrifice.

4) O Lord Krsna, O crest-jewel on the summit of Govardhana Hill, O glorifier of Govardhana Hill, after the cowherd men had offered ornaments and foodstuffs, You caused them to circumambulate the Hill.
