**LYRICS:**

(refrain)

praṇām tomāy ghana-śyām

(1)

tomār caraṇa śaraṇa kori

abhoy ei bār ho’bo hari

duḥkha sāgor jābo tori

tori kari tomār nām

(2)

āmarā paḍi ghumāy prabhu

tomār nitya jāgaran

kṣane kṣane ghaṭāo ye bhūl

cakṣe moder āvaraṇ

(3)

sei āvaraṇ ghucāo hari

dārāo yugāl mūrti dhari

dekhi tomāy nayana bhari

pūrṇa kori manuśkām

**TRANSLATION**

Refrain: All obeisances to You, O Ghana-syam!

1) Taking refuge at Your lotus feet, now I will become fearless, O Lord! I will cross the ocean of miseries by the boat of Your Holy Name.

2) O Lord, we have fallen into sleep, while You are ever awake. Every moment we can only make errors, our eyes being covered by illusion.

3) Please remove this covering, my Lord, so I may behold Your form as the Divine Couple, with Sri Radha by Your side. I will gaze at You until my hankering eyes are pacified, thus fulfilling my soul’s desire.
