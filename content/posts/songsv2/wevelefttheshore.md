**LYRICS:**

(1)

We’ve left the shore, We’re sailing forth, to our promised land

Across the seas, of many miseries, We’ll not return again

Lord, you sent him here to open up our eyes

Now, your pure devotee gives his high advice

(2)

We’ve faded away having gone astray, from our forest lands

Being orphan souls of many changing roles, from strange and foreign lands

Oh! We have traveled all alone

Now, are Gurudeva has come to take us home

(Refrain)

Prabhupada, you are the captain of the boat

Giving us direction how stay afloat

Prabhupada, you are the master of the ship

Guiding us and making sure we never slip

(3)

The loads of ways on how his binding gaze, he takes the eyes

The gentle breeze of truth and harmony, gives us inner light

So, the time has come to listen and to learn

How, to sail into the world that lies within

(4)

We have the guide, standing high insight, showing us the way

The friend indeed, with no selfish greed, can cause a tidal wave

So, you sailed the ship beyond the stars

To, the lotus petal planet of Lord Krsna.

(Refrain)

Prabhupada, you are the captain of the boat

Giving us direction how stay afloat

Prabhupada, you are the master of the ship

Guiding us and making sure we never slip

Prabhupada, you are the master of the mind

Calling to innovated mass of fallen mankind

Prabhupada, you are the savior of the soul

Giving understanding on how to reach the highest goal
