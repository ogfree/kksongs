**TRANSLATION**

1) Separated from Krsna by a lover's quarrel, and overwhelmed by the pain of separation and the desire to again meet Her lover, a certain beautiful gopi said to Her friend:

2) O fair-complexioned friend, will He ever again walk on the pathway of My eyes, He who is 1. all-attractive, 2. an ocean of mercy, 3. dark-complexioned, 4. dear to Gokula,

3) 5. the pleasure of the cows, land, and senses, 6. supremely blissful, 7. the auspiciousness of Nanda's palace, 8. the jewel taken from the mine of Yasoda, 9. the moon risen from the ocean of the king of the gopas,

4) 10. whose bodily splendor mocks the thundering monsoon clouds, 11. who wears yellow silk garments that eclipse the pride of gold,

5) 12. the splendor of whose toenails removes the pride of Kamadeva, 13. whose feet are splendid with the marks of the flag, lotus, thunderbolt, yava, and rod for controlling elephants,

6) 14. whose feet are a cage and whose sweetly tinkling anklets khanjana birds, 15. whose splendid knees are two sapphire cases,

7) 16. whose splendid thighs are graceful as the trunks of wild elephants, 17. whose broad hips are decorated with a belt of jewelled bells,

8) 18. whose handsome waist destroys the pride of the lions of heaven, 19. whose chest is as great as a sapphire mountain,

9) 20. whose conchshell neck is decorated with the king of jewels, 21. the intense splendor of whose arms rivals the sapphire column,

10) 22. Whose face breaks the beauty of millions of full moons, 23. who is an ocean filled with waves of handsomeness, 24. whose lips are like red sindura,

11) 25. whose eyes are as handsome as newly blossomed lotuses, 26. on the edge of whose cheeks shark-shaped earrings playfully dance,

12) 27. Whose transcendental body shines with the splendor of youth, 28. whose sidelong glances are as powerful as the bows of millions of gods of love,

13) 29. whose pleasing words are as sweet as nectar, 30. who is a wild elephant in the jungles and caves of Vrndavana,

14) 31. who is a new lotus flower on the lofty peak of grand Mount Govardhana, 32. who is a handsome swan playing in the Yamuna,

15) 33. who is happy in the village of Nandisvara, 34. who dances in Bhandiravana forest, 35. who killed Sankhacuda, 36. who made the king of mountains into a toy ball,     

16)  37\. who is deeper than millions of oceans, 38. who is stronger than millions of lions, 39. who is the delight of Baladeva, 40. who is the dear friend of Sridama, 

17) 41. who is the dear friend of Subala, 42. who stays in the hearts of His friends, 43. who has taken a vow to increase the happiness of the people in Nanda's Vraja,

18) 44. who calls the cows with the musi of His flute, 45. whose playing imitates the fighting of great bulls,

19) 46. who is decorated with splendid forest flowers, 47. who is the great deity of conjugal love, 48. whose glorious form is decorated with peacock feathers, 

20) 49. whose five-colored flower garland is worshiped by the wandering bees, 50. whose belt is decorated with suranga, rangana, and svarna-yuthi flowers,

21) 51. who, His limbs decorated with colorful pictures drawn in mineral pigments, is flooded with waves of handsomeness, 52. who is decorated with gunja, 53. who rests on a pastime bed of leaves and flowers,

22) 54. the madhvika fragrance of whose transcendental form maddens the gopis, 55. who arouses the amorous desires of the lotus-eyed girls of Vrndavana,

23) 56. who is anointed with kunkuma from the breasts of the passionate gopis, 57. the sweetness of whose moonlike face is grasped by the eyes of the pious gopis,

24)  58\. who stole the garments of the young girls, 59. who expertly teased them with outrageous jokes, 60. whose bewildering expertise plunged Sri Radha into an ocean of nectar,  

25) 61. who is the arrival of autumn for the moonlight of beautiful Candravali's intelligence, 62. who is playful and happy, 63. who is charming with the bliss of amorous pastimes,

26) 64. who is the king of cakora birds drinking the moonlight of Candravali, 65. who is madhvika nectar for Sri Radhika, 66. who enjoys playful pastimes with Lalita, 67. who is a moon shining beside the star Visakha,

27) 68. who is a bumblebee at Padma's lotus flower mouth, 69. whose lotus feet are served by Saibya, 70. who naps in Bhadra's heart, 71. who yearns to enjoy amorous pastimes with Syamala,

28) 72. who is a garden filled with the flowering vines of extraordinary wonderful pastimes, 73. who is iron irresistably attracted to the magnet of pure love,

29) 74. who took the bodices of the fair-complexioned girls who stole His flute, 75. for whom a meeting with Radha is the be-all and end-all of His life, 76. who is the teacher of the arts of cleverness and wit, 

30) 77. who yearns to hear Radha's playful jokes, 78. who arrogantly forbade Radha to pick the kadamba flowers,

31) 79. who longed to meet Radha, who hid from Him in the forest, 80. whom playfully arrogant Radha struck with a lotus earring,

32) 81. who broke Radha's kunkuma armor in the amorous battle, 82. whose handsome form bends in three places, 83. who places the flute to His lips,

33) 84. whose flute melodies are the best of all music, 85. who is the king of thousands of gopis, 86. who becomes maddened by drinking the sweet nectar of the rasa dance,

34) 87. whose sidelong glances are agitating as millions of arrows from the god of love, 88. who dances on the shore of the Yamuna,

35) 89. who is the lotus pond that fulfills the desires of the bumblebee Radha, 90. who smiles at the jokes of Radha, who has a hidden intention behind Her joking,

36) 91. who disguised Himself as a woman, 92. who fills the heart with wonder, 93. whose lotus mouth contains a mixture of camphor and betel nuts,

37) 94. with whom the gopi messenger of proud Candravali has arranged a meeting, 95. whose knitted eyebrows stopped Radha as She approached the toll-station,

38) 96. who is embarrassed by the laughter, tricks, and taunts of Radha's clever messenger, 97. who is the personified love of the gopis, 98. who is the personified nectar of the auspicious and blissful mellows of transcendental love,

39) 99. who waited at the place of rendezvous, eagerly listening for beautiful Bhadra's jingling anklets, 100, whom carefully dressed and decorated Padma saw in the path,

40) 101. who entered the path of yearning, distressed Lalita's speculations, 102. who made cheated Visakha cry,

41) 103. whose face Syama, separated from Him by a lover's quarrel, longed to see, 104. whose heart relished Syama's angry condemnation of His unfaithfulness,

42) 105. who was happy to read the letter of Candravali, who was unhappoy to be separated from Him, 106. who is very expert at decorating jubilant Radha, who has Him completely under Her control,

43) 107. the edge of whose garment was clutched by Radha, who won the dice game where Her kiss and His flute were wagered, and 108. whose heart contains the swiftly moving nectar stream of love for Sri Radha.

44) In this way, her heart maddened with pure love, the gopi glorified Lord Krsna, the killer of Kamsa. She then saw Krsna appear before her and she rejoiced with great bliss.

45) O learned readers, with the Mandara Mountain of your tongues please lovingly churn this ocean of the moon of pure love (premendu-sagara), which contains 108 names of Lord Krsna.
