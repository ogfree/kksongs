**LYRICS:**

(1)

Tears streaming from their eyes

Nanda and Yasoda hug their son

Tightly they hold their dearest prize.

Then as the reddish brilliant thousand-rayed sun

(2)

Slowly begins to rise in the morning sky

Smiling graceful lotus-eyed Krsna walks

In the forest The boys and surabhi cows follow by

His side Playful jokes adorn His talks

(3)

With His friends Flowers adorn His limbs and crown.

Complex graceful melodies fill His flute.

He happily leads many millions of cows down

The flower-filled forest path Yogurt and fruit

(4)

Are His sweet and pleasant lunch in the cooling shade

Of a fragrant flowering tree in a forest glade.
