**LYRICS:**

(Refrain)

dekha dekha aparupa gaura-bilasa

lakha yubati rati yo guru lampata

so aba karala sannyasa

(1)

gopi-gana-kuca-kunkume ranjita

aruna basana sobhe ange

kancana-kanti-binindita-kalebara

ra-i parara rasa\-range

(2)

yo braja-badhu-gana dadha-bhuja-bandhana

abirata rahata agora

so tanu pulake purita asa dhara dhara

nayane galaye prema-lora

(3)

yo nata-bara ghana-syama kalebara

banda-bipina-bihari

kahaye balarama nata-bara so aba

akincana ghare ghare prema-bhikhari

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) Look! Look at Lord Gaura’s wonderful pastimes! The great debauchee who loved millions of girls now has accepted sannyasa.

1) In the past He bore marks of red from the kunkuma on the gopis’ breasts. Now a saffron garment decorates His limbs. In the past He was delighted by Srimati Radharani’s sweet touch. Now His fair body rebukes the splendor of gold.

2) In the past He was tightly bound by the vraja-gopis’ arms. Now He is always overcome with the ecstasy of a devotee’s spiritual love. Now the hairs of His body stand erect in spiritual love. Now tears of spiritual love stream from His eyes.

3) He was the graceful dancer whose body was dark like a monsoon cloud, the dancer who enjoyed pastimes in Vrndavana Forest. Balarama dasa says: That best of dancers has now become a penniless sannyasi. Now He goes from house to house begging everyone to give the alms that they will fall in love with Lord Krsna.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This is to be sung in Raga Kedara.
