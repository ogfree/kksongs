**LYRICS:**

(1)

hari he!

arthera sañcaye,  viṣaya-prayāse,

āno-kathā-prajalpane

āno-adhikāra,  niyama āgrahe,

asat-sańga-saḿghaṭane

(2)

asthira siddhānte,  rohinu mojiyā,

hari-bhakti roilo dūre

e hṛdoye mātro,  para-hiḿsā, mada,

pratiṣṭhā, śaṭhatā sphure

(3)

e saba āgraha,  chāḍite nārinu,

āpana doṣate mari

janama biphala,  hoilo āmāra,

ekhona ki kori, hari!

(4)

āmi to’ patita,  patita-pāvana,

tomāra pavitra nāma

se sambandha dhori’,  tomāra caraṇe,

śaraṇa loinu hāma

**TRANSLATION**

1-2) O Lord Hari, I have become absorbed in accumulating wealth and endeavoring for material possessions. I am addicted to speaking of topics apart from You and am always eager to accept practices apart from my own duties. I am in the habit of meeting with worldly men and am absorbed in speculative thinking. Therefore, devotion to You has remained distant from me. In this heart of mine dwells only envy and malice towards others false pride, hypocrisy, deceitfulness, and the desire for fame and honor.

3) I have not been able to give up any of these attachments. Thus my own faults have been my down fall. My birth as a human being has been wasted. O Lord Hari, what am I to do now?

4) I am indeed fallen; but Your holy name is the savior of the fallen. Clinging to that holy name, I have taken shelter at Your lotus feet.
