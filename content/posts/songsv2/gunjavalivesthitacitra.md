**TRANSLATION**

1) On His crown of gunja and colourful flowers a peacock feather moves to and fro. He wears handsome gorocana tilaka. I bow down before Jagan-mohana, the Lord whom I worship.

2) Gopis maddened by the movements of His eyebrows pierce His eyes with arrows of sidelong glances. The tip of His nose is decorated with a splendid jewel and a beautiful pearl. I bow down before Jagan-mohana, the Lord whom I worship.

3) The splendor of His moving locks of curly hair kisses the charming smile on His cheeks. The tips of His swaying earrings touch His handsome shoulders. I bow down before Jagan-mohana, the Lord whom I worship.

4) His neck tilted, He holds a glistening flute to His bent lips, which rebuke the splendour of the bimba fruit and bandhuka flower. I bow down before Jagan-mohana, the Lord whom I worship.

5) Three lines clearly mark His splendid neck as He sings melodies delightful to the ear. His chest is decorated with a glittering Kaustubha jewel, and His shoulders are broad. I bow down before Jagan-mohana, the Lord whom I worship.

6) Reaching to His knees, and decorated with glistening bracelets and armlets, His handsome bending arms are like Kamadeva's great wooden bolts. He is decorated with garlands of priceless pearls, jewels, and flowers. I bow down before Jagan-mohana, the Lord whom I worship.

7) Marked with a charming line of hairs, His abdomen is like a banyan leaf that moves as He breathes. He is dressed in yellow garments, and His ankle-bells tinkle melodiously. I bow down before Jagan-mohana, the Lord whom I worship.

8) Decorated with jewel anklets, one foot is placed behind the other. His complexion is dark. His form bends in three places. He enjoys pastimes with Sri Radha under a desire tree. I bow down before Jagan-mohana, the Lord whom I worship.

9) May he who by reading these eight verses remembers Sriman Jagan-mohana-deva attain pure love of God. May he become plunged into the nectar of direct service to the Lord's feet.
