**LYRICS:**

(1)

vṛṣabhānu-sutā-  caraṇa-sevane,

hoibo ye pālya-dāsī

śrī-rādhāra sukha,  satata sādhane,

rohibo āmi prayāsī

(2)

śrī-rādhāra sukhe,  kṛṣṇaera ye sukha,

jānibo manete āmi

rādhā-pada chāḍi’,  śrī-kṛṣṇa-sańgame,

kabhu nā hoibo kāmī

(3)

sakhī-gaṇa mama,  parama-suhṛt,

yugala-premera guru

tad-anugā ho’ye,  sevibo rādhāra,

caraṇa-kalapa-taru

(4)

rādhā-pakṣa chāḍi’,  ye-jana se-jana,

ye bhāve se bhāve thāke

āmi to’ rādhikā-  pakṣa-pātī sadā,

kabhu nāhi heri tā’ke

**TRANSLATION**

1) For serving the lotus feet of the charming daughter of King Vrsabhanu, I will become a sheltered maidservant of Her maidservant. Indeed, I will live only for the happiness of Sri Radha, and I will always endeavor to increase Her joy.

2) I will understand within my heart that Krsna feels happiness only when Radha is happy. I will thus never, ever dare become desirous of abandoning Radhika's lotus feet to be with Krsna myself.

3) All my associate sakhis are my supreme well-wishers, my best friends, and they are the teachers of my lessons in conjugal love. Simply by following them, I will serve the lotus feet of Radha, which are just like desire-fulfilling trees.

4) I am forever partial and prone to favoring the party of Sri Radhika. I will never even look upon those persons who have abandoned Her entourage, whoever they may be and regardless of what they preach.
