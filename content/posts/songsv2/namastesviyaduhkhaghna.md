**TRANSLATION**

1) O Krsna, You removed the grief the inhabitants of Vraja were feeling on Your account. You expertly played with the Kaliya serpent, making his hoods the arena for Your dancing, and crushing those hoods as You danced. I offer respectful obeisances unto You.

2) O Krsna, accompanied by the songs and instrumental music of the Gandharvas, Siddhas and other demigods, You danced on Kaliya's hoods, Your beautiful lotus-feet reddened by the jewels decorating those hoods.

3) O Krsna, with the crushing steps of Your lotus feet You forced Kaliya, the king of snakes, to bow down his head. His body broken and vomiting blood, that serpent, in that very wretched condition, began to understand Your transcendental position.
