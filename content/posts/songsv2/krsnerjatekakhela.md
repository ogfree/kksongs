**LYRICS:**

(1)

kṛṣṇera jateka khelā          tāra madhye nara-līlā

sarbottama rasera āloya

e rasa goloke nāi        tabe bolo kothā pāi

braja-dhāma tāhāra niloya

(2)

nitya-līlā dwi-prakāra        sāntara o nirantara

jāhe mājhe rasikera mana

janma-bṛddhi daitya-nāśa      mathurā dwārakā-bāsa

nitya-līlā sāntare gaṇana

(3)

dibā rātra aṣṭa-bhāge         braja-jana anurāge

kore kṛṣṇa-līlā nirantara

tāhāra birāma nāi        sei nitya-līlā bhāi

brahma-rudra-śeṣa agocara

(4)

jñāna joga koro jata          hoya tāhā dūra-gata

śuddha rāga nayane kebala

sei līlā rākhita hoya         parānanda bitaroya

hoya bhakta-jībana sambala

**TRANSLATION**

1) Among all of Lord Krsna's pastimes, His lila as an ordinary human being is certainly the best of all, for these pastimes are like an unlimited reservoir of ecstatic transcendental mellows. These mellows are not even available on other planets in the spiritual sky. So then tell me where are they available? Such things can only be had in the topmost abode of Vraja-dhama.

2) Krsna's eternal pastimes are of two types, which are always meditated on by those who know how to relish the mellows --- 1) santara (pastimes performed in the material world at intervals, with a beginning and an end, but which repeat eternally), and 2) nirantara (pastimes performed in the spiritual world as perpetual asta-kaliya or eight-fold daily sports). Pastimes called santara include Krsna's birth, His growth through childhood and youth, the killing of many different kinds of demons, and His journey to and residence at Mathura and Dvaraka.

3) Those pastimes which are called nirantara are performed incessantly, in eight time divisions the entire day and night. These sports are motivated by His pure loving affection for the residents of Vraja. These pastimes do not stop even for a second --- therefore it's called nitya-lila, oh brothers! These eight-fold daily pastimes are imperceptible even for Lord Brahma, Lord Siva and Lord Ananta-sesa.

4) Just toss out all of your speculative knowledge and yoga practice, for all of these ecstatic lilas of Vraja are just waiting for you to behold them with your eyes of unalloyed affection opened wide. These transcendental pastimes are capable of giving you only one thing ---topmost spiritual bliss far beyond anything you can even imagine. This only is the sole sustenance in the lives of pure devotees who follow in the footsteps of Srila Rupa Gosvami.
