**LYRICS:**

(refrain)

śyāma pīyā more rańga de cunariyā

(1)

aisī rangade ke rańga nāhī chūte

dhobiyā dhoye cāhe yeh sārī umariyā

(2)

lāl nā rańgāuń maiń harī nā rańgāuń

apane hī rańga meń rangade cunariyā

(3)

binā rańgāye main to ghar nahī jāuńgī

bīt hī jāye cāhe yeh sārī umariyā

(4)

jal se patalā kaun hai

kaun bhūmī se bhārī

kaun agana se tej hai

kaun kājala se kārī

(5)

jala se patalā jñāna hai

aur pāpa bhūmī se bhārī

krodha agana se teja hai

aur ik kalańka kājala se kārī

(6)

mīrā ke prabhu giridhara nāgara

prabhu caraṇana meń

hari caraṇana meń

śyāma caraṇana meń lāgī najarīyā

**TRANSLATON**

(Refrain): Oh Dearest Loved Syama, Please color our chunaris.

1) Please color the chunaris that they will never fade, no matter if the washer washes it for my entire life.

2) I don’t want it red, nor do I want it green. I want it to the color of You, the color of Syama!

3) Without having it colored, I will not return home, even if I have to wait my entire life.

4) What is the lighter than water? What is lower than the earth? What is hotter than fire? What is the destruction of light?

5) Knowledge (jnana) is lighter than water. Sin is lower than earth. Anger is hotter than fire, and lust is the destruction of light.

6) The Lord of Mira, the courtly Giridhara, feels very close to the Lotus feet of the Lord, Hari, Syama!
