sri-bhagavan kahilen:

abhaya sattva samsiddhi jnane avasthan

dan dam yajna ar svadhyay tapan

saralata satya ar ahimsa akrodh

tyag santi daya ar paraninda rodh

alolupata mrduta tej acapal

ksama, dhrti, souca, va hri adroha sakal

abhiman sunyata se chavvisa ye gun

sampad se hay tar yar daivite janam

(4)

dambha, darpa, abhiman, krodh, nisthurata

sampada asuri hay yatha ajnanata

(5)

daivi sampada ye tar muktira karan

asuri sampada hay samsara vandhan

tomara cintara katha nahi he pandava

daivi sampade tomar hayechhe janam

(6)

he bharat, e jagate dui bhut srsti

ek daivi dvitiya se asuri va drsti

daivi yara tar katha anek hayeche

suna ebe katha yara asura janmeche

(7)

pravrtti nivrtti yaha asura na jane

soucacar satya mithya nahi tara mane

(8)

asura ye lok tara na mane isvar

jagater vidhata yini asvikara tar

srstira karan sei anisvaravadi

jada karya-karana se kamuka vivadi

(9)

ei ksudra drsti laye asurera gan

atma-tattva-jnanahin alpa-buddhi han

ugra-karme utsaha tar jagata ahita

ksaya-karye patu tara hay prabhavita

(10)

duspura asraya kama dambha madanvita

mohagrasta asadagraha asuci-vrata

(11-12)

apareya cinta tar yatadina bnace

kama-matra upabhog hrdayete ache

sata sata asa-pas sudhu kam krodha

kama-bhoga lagi artha anya se virodha

anyaya se kare nitya sancayete

citta tar nitya viddha asata karyete

(13-16)

adya ei artha-labh mano-ratha siddhi

punarbar bhavisyate habe artha vrddhi

se satru marila anya niscaya mariba

ami se isvara dhani se karya sadhiva

ami bhogi siddha ar balabana sukhi

mama sama keha nahe ar saba duhkhi

ami abhijanavan ami dhana-adhya

amara samana habe kar kiva sadhya

ami se kariba yajna ami dan diba

stri-sanga kariya ami ananda paiba

ajnana mohita haye kata katha bale

mohajala samavrta kalera kavale

asalete kamasakta narakera yatri

asuci narake bas naraka vidhatr

(17)

atma sambhavita man dhanete anamra

madanvita asura se sarvada vinamra

nama-matra yajna kare sastre vidhi nai

dambha-matra ache sar kevala badai

(18)

ahamkar, vala, darpa, kam, krodhasray

amara samparke dehe dves se karay

asuyar vase cinta svapara apare

sadhura gunete dos kimba ninda kare

(19)

sei se vidvesi krur naradhama gane

nitya se ksepana kari samsara gahane

(20)

asura yonite hay janama maran

ajasra asubha tar jivana yapan

asurera ghare mudha janame janame

amake bhuliya duhkhi marame marame

krame krame paya sei adhama ye gati

aksama amake pete yehetu kumati

(21)

sei kama, krodh, lobh, narakera dvar

tyaja taha nay tin sadhu vyavahar

(22)

ei tine mukta yara suna he kaunteya

tamogunera dvar sei atisay heya

tabe se acari dharma nija sreyaskar

paragata labh kare mama bhakti par

(23)

sastra vidhi parityage kama acaran

siddhiprapti nahe tahe sukha gatipar

(24)

ataeva sastra-vidhi karyera praman

jani sastra-vidhi kara karya samadhana

(25)

bhaktivedanta kahe sri-gitara gan

sune yadi suddha bhakta krsnagata-pran

**TRANSLATION**

1-3) The Blessed Lord said: Fearlessness, purification of one's existence, cultivation of spiritual knowledge, charity, self-control, performance of sacrifice, study of the Vedas, austerity and simplicity; nonviolence, truthfulness, freedom from anger; renunciation, tranquility, aversion to faultfinding, compassion and freedom from covetousness; gentleness, modesty and steady determination; vigor, forgiveness, fortitude, cleanliness, freedom from envy and the passion for honor--these transcendental qualities, O son of Bharata, belong to godly men endowed with divine nature.

4) Arrogance, pride, anger, conceit, harshness and ignorance--these qualities belong to those of demoniac nature, O son of Prtha.

5) The transcendental qualities are conducive to liberation, whereas the demoniac qualities make for bondage. Do not worry, O son of Pandu, for you are born with the divine qualities.

6) O son of Prtha, in this world there are two kinds of created beings. One is called the divine and the other demoniac. I have already explained to you at length the divine qualities. Now hear from Me of the demoniac.

7) Those who are demoniac do not know what is to be done and what is not to be done. Neither cleanliness nor proper behavior nor truth is found in them.

8) They say that this world is unreal, that there is no foundation and that there is no God in control. It is produced of sex desire, and has no cause other than lust.

9) Following such conclusions, the demoniac, who are lost to themselves and who have no intelligence, engage in unbeneficial, horrible works meant to destroy the world.

10) The demoniac, taking shelter of insatiable lust, pride and false prestige, and being thus illusioned, are always sworn to unclean work, attracted by the impermanent.

11-12) They believe that to gratify the senses unto the end of life is the prime necessity of human civilization. Thus there is no end to their anxiety. Being bound by hundreds and thousands of desires, by lust and anger, they secure money by illegal means for sense gratification.

13-15) The demoniac person thinks: "So much wealth do I have today, and I will gain more according to my schemes. So much is mine now, and it will increase in the future, more and more. He is my enemy, and I have killed him; and my other enemy will also be killed. I am the lord of everything. I am the enjoyer. I am perfect, powerful and happy. I am the richest man, surrounded by aristocratic relatives. There is none so powerful and happy as I am. I shall perform sacrifices, I shall give some charity, and thus I shall rejoice." In this way, such persons are deluded by ignorance.

16) Thus perplexed by various anxieties and bound by a network of illusions, one becomes too strongly attached to sense enjoyment and falls down into hell.

17) Self-complacent and always impudent, deluded by wealth and false prestige, they sometimes perform sacrifices in name only without following any rules or regulations.

18) Bewildered by false ego, strength, pride, lust and anger, the demon becomes envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is situated in his own body and in the bodies of others, and blasphemes against the real religion.

19) Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, are cast by Me into the ocean of material existence, into various demoniac species of life.

20) Attaining repeated birth amongst the species of demoniac life, such persons can never approach Me. Gradually they sink down to the most abominable type of existence.

21) There are three gates leading to this hell--lust, anger and greed. Every sane man should give these up, for they lead to the degradation of the soul.

22) The man who has escaped these three gates of hell, O son of Kunti, performs acts conducive to self-realization and thus gradually attains the supreme destination.

23) But he who discards scriptural injunctions and acts according to his own whims attains neither perfection, nor happiness, nor the supreme destination.

24) One should understand what is duty and what is not duty by the regulations of the scriptures. Knowing such rules and regulations, one should act so that he may gradually be elevated.

25) Thus Bhaktivedanta sings the song of Sri Gita, with the hope that hearing this, Krsna conscious pure devotees will be pleased.
