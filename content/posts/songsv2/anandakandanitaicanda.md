**LYRICS:**

(1)

ananda kanda nita-i canda

karuna nayana karuna chanda

karuna pura saghane jhura

hari hari bali bolo re

(2)

nataka ranga bhakata sanga

bibidha bhasa rasa-taranga

isata hasa madhura bhasa

saghane gima dola re

(3)

patita kora jagata gaura

dina rajani anande bhora

prema-ratana kariya yatana

jaga-jane karu dana re

(4)

kirtana majha rasika\-raja

yaichana kanaya giri biraja

braja-bihara rasa bithara

madhura madhura gana re

(5)

dhuli dhusara dharani upara

kabahun lokata preme gara gara

kabahun calata kabahun khelata

kabahun atta-hasa re

(6)

kabahun sweda kabahun kheda

kabahun pulaka swara abheda

kabahun lampha kabahun jhampa

kabahun dirgha-swasa re

(7)

karuna sindhu akhila bandhu

kali-yuga-tama-pulaka-indu

jagata-locana patala-mocana

nita-i purala yasa re

(8)

andha adhama dina durjana

prema-dane karala mocana

pa-ola jagata kebala bancita

e radha-ballabha dasa re

**TRANSLATION**

1) Lord Nitaicandra is the root of transcendental bliss. His Eyes are reddish. His Face is glorious. His anklets jangle. He chant: “Hari! Hari!”

2) Surrounded by the devotees, He enjoys the pastimes of dancing. His talking is waves of Nectar. He gently smiles. His words are sweet. His Neck sways to and fro.

3) He hugs the fallen souls. Lord Gaura is the whole world to Him. Day and Night He is overcome with spiritual bliss. To the people of this world, He earnestly gives the gift of ecstatic spiritual Love.

4) In the kirtan of chanting the Holy Names, He is the King of those who taste the Nectar. He glistens like a golden mountain. He sings sweet songs of Lord Krsna's Nectar pastimes in Vraja.

5-6) Falling to the ground, He is covered with dust. He laughs loudly. Overcome with ecstatic Love, He rolls about on the ground. Sometimes He is restless. Sometimes He is playful. Sometimes He perspires. Sometimes He laments. Sometimes His bodily hairs stand up. Sometimes He calls out. Sometimes He leaps. Sometimes He hides and let out long sighs.

7) He is an ocean of Mercy. He is everyone's friend. He is a moon glistening in the darkness of Kali-Yuga. He gives eyes to the people of this world. He pulls away the curtain of illusions. He fulfills everyone's desires.

8) To the blind, fallen, poor, wicked souls of this world, He gives the gift of ecstatic spiritual Love. He delivers the whole world. Only Radha-Vallabha Dasa is not delivered. Only he is cheated.
