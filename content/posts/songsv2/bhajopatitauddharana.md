**LYRICS**

(1)

bhajo patita uddhārana śrī gaura hari;

śrī gaura hari navadvīpa bihārī

(2)

eso eso mahaprabhu kori nivedan;

ebe dīna dāser gṛhe koro āgamana

(3)

prabhu loye bhaktagana korilen gaman;

ānandete hulu dicche joto nārīgana

(4)

(hulu-dhvani)

advaita gṛhinī āra śāntipura nārī

hulu hulu dhvani dey gora mukha heri

(5)

bosite āsana dilā ratna siḿhāsana;

suśītala jale koilā pāda prakhālana

(6)

śrī kṛṣṇa caitanya prabhu koro avadhāna;

bhoga mandire prabhu koroho poyān

(7)

bāmete advaita prabhu dakhine nitāi;

madhyāsane bosilen caitanya gosāi

(8)

cauṣati mahānta ār dvādaśa gopāla;

choy chakrabarti ār aṣṭa kabirāja

saghṛta śālyanna byanjana diyā sāri sāri;

bhogera upore dilo tulasī manjarī

(9)

śāk śuktā maucā dilo ār o dilo bhājā;

ānande bhojana koren nadīyāra rājā

(10)

gańgā jala tulasī diyā koilo nivedan;

ānande bhojana koren śacira nandan

(11)

dadhi dugdha ghṛta chānā nānā upahār;

ānande bhojana koren śacīra kumāra

(12)

māl puwā sara bhājā āra luci purī

ānande bhojana korena nadīya bihārī

(13)

nāhi jāni paripāṭi nā jāni randhana;

śukā rukhā eka muṭhi koroho bhojan

(14)

bhojanera avaśeṣe kohite nā pāri;

suvarṇa bhṛńgāre dilo suvāsita bāri

(15)

bhojana koriyā prabhu koilen ācaman;

suvarṇa khorikāy koren danta śodhan

(16)

ācamana koriyā prabhu bosilen simhāsane;

karpūra tāmbūla yogāy priya bhaktagan

(17)

tāmbūla khāiyā prabhur pālańke śayan;

govinda dās kore caraṇa sevan

(18)

phulera chauwārī ghor phulera kheyārī

phulera ratna simhāsana cāndowā mośārī

(19)

phulera pāpari prabhur ure pore gāy;

tāra madhye mahāprabhu sukhe nidrā jāy

(20)

śrī kṛṣṇa caitanya prabhur dāser anudās;

sevā abhilāṣa māge narottama dāsa
