**LYRICS:**

(1)

karma phale āse saba nānā veśa dhari

veśete majiyā thāke bhuliyā śrī hari

(2)

ataeva māyā tāre deya bahu duḥkha

duḥkhe hābuḍubu tabu tāhe māne sukha

(3)

cīra rogī duḥkha bhogī śayyāte śuiyā

bhālo āchi āja kohe hāsiyā hāsiyā

(4)

hāsi pāy tār “bhālo thākāra” kathāy

māyā baddha jīvera bhālo ei bhāve hoy

**TRANSLATION**

1) By the fruits of action, all souls come down and adopt a body. Immersed in that dress of the body, they forget Sri Hari.

2) Therefore, illusion give them great misery and suffering. As they are immersed and resubmerged in this misery, they think it is happiness.

3) A chronic patient suffering great pain lies upon his bed laughs and smiles, “I am doing well, today!”

4) I get amused by their “I’m doing well” talk. For the illusion-bound spirit soul, this is what “fine” means to them.
