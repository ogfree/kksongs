**LYRICS:**

(1)

tumi deba nārāyaṇa deba maheśwar

sṛṣṭi sthiti pralayera tumi sarbeśwar

(2)

koṭi-koṭi-brahmāṇḍera tumi adhikārī

āmarā śakati stuti ki karite pāri

(3)

bhāla haila ṛṣi more dila śāpa-bāṇī

yāńhāra prasāde āmrā dekhinu cakra-pāṇi

(4)

tomār nāma baliye sei hauk bāṇī

munira prasāde mora dekhinu cakra-pāṇi

(5)

sei hasta hauk je tomāra karma kare

se mastaka hauk je tomāre namaskāre

(6)

sei cakṣu hauk je tore nirīkṣay

sei mana hauk je tomāke dhyāy

(7)

sei pāda hauk je tomāra kṣetra jāy

sei jihwā hauk je tomār prasāda khāy

(8)

etake karila stuti sei dui jan

hāsiyā ta' dayā kari kaila nārāyaṇ

**TRANSLATION**

1) You are Lord Narayana. You are the master of all. You are the creator, maintainer, and destroyer of the material world.

2) You are the controller of millions and millions of universes. If you give me the power, I will be able to speak eloquent prayers glorifying You.

3) The sage who cursed me gave me a great benediction, for it is by his mercy that I now see the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the holder of the cakra.

4) By the mercy of that sage, I now see the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the holder of the cakra. O Lord, a person who has a voice should use that voice to chant Your holy name.

5) He who has hands, should use his hands to work for You. He who has a head should use his head to bow down before You.

6) He who has eyes should gaze on You. He who has a mind should meditate on You.

7) He who has feet should walk to Your holy place. He who has a tongue should taste the prasadam offered to You.

8) Thus these two persons offered prayers to the Lord. Lord Narayana smiled at them and gave them His mercy.
