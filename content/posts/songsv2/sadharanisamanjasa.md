**LYRICS:**

(1)

sādhāraṇi samañjasā      sthāyī lābhe bhāba daśā

kubjā āra mahiṣī pramāṇa

eka braja-debī-gaṇe      mahā-bhāba sańghaṭane

rūḍha adhirūḍha su-bidhāna

(2)

nimeṣāsahyatā tāya       hṛn-mathane khinna prāya

kalpa khaṇa saukhye śańkākula

ātmābadhi bismaraṇa      khaṇa kalpa bibecana

joge bā bijoge samatula

(3)

adhirūḍha bhābe punaḥ         dwi-prakāra bheda śuna

modana mādana nāme khyāta

biśleṣa daśāte punaḥ          modana hoya mohana

dibyonmāda tāhe hoya jata

(4)

dibyonmāda dwi-prakāra        citra-jalpodghūrṇa āra

citra-jalpa bahu-bidha tāya

mohanete śrī-rādhāra          mādanākhya daśā sāra

nitya-līlāmoyī bhāba pāya

(5)

sādhāraṇī dhūmayitā          samañjasā sadā dīpta

rūḍhe tathoddīpta samarthāya

śuddīpta śrī-rādhā-prema         jena ujjwalita hema

modanādi bhābe sadā tāya

**TRANSLATION**

1) The highest limits that the sthayi-bhava can attain are fixed up according to different divisions of Krsna's lovers. The girl Kubja of Mathura and Krsna's 16,000 Queens of Dvaraka are examples of the bhavas known respectively as sadharani (the fickle love-infatuation felt by common girls) and samanjasa (the consistent love felt by wives). However, only the Vraja gopis can attain the advanced states of maha\- bhava known as rudha (advanced) and adhirudha (highly advanced).

2) The symptoms of rudha ecstasy are: intolerance of separation even by the blinking of an eye, the churning of the hearts of persons nearby, experiencing a millennium spent with Krsna to be like an instant, experiencing an instant of separation from Krsna to be like a millennium, feeling great pain in worrying about Krsna's happiness, and forgetfulness of self-identity. All these anubhavas of the rudha ecstasy can be experienced in both union and separation.

3) Now kindly hear of the two divisions of the adhirudha maha-bhava, known as modana (divine pleasure) and madana (madly intoxicated amorous exhilaration). In separation from Krsna, the modana also becomes what in known as mohana (wonder-struk astonishment) at a certain stage, thereby producing a transcendental madness called divyonmada.

4) This divyonmada also has two divisions known as 1) citra-jalpa (various types of insane raving speech). and 2) udghurna (uncontrollably wonder-struck giddiness). After She relishes Her mohana state of wonder-struck astonishment, Sri Radha attains an even more essential condition called madana, or madly intoxicated amorous exhilaration. This is the summit of ecstasy that stimulates the flow of Her eternal pastimes.

5) The sadharani lovers (common girls like Kubja) have smoldering love. The samanjasa lovers (consistent wives like the Queens of Dvaraka) have ignited love. The samartha lovers (the Vraja gopis) have burning ecstasy; but above all of them, Sri Radha's loving ecstasies are brilliantly blazing like the dazzling shimmer of pure gold, for only in Her moods can one find these topmost brilliant ecstasies headed by modana and madana.
