**TRANSLATION**

1) O Lord Krsna, all glories unto You. As Akrura, the son of Svaphalka took his bath in the Yamuna, You remained on his chariot. When Akrura was immersed in the water, You showed a supremely amazing thing to him.

2) O Lord Krsna, Akrura offered prayers to You, saying that You are beginning-less and without an origin, and that indeed the lotus flower sprouted from Your navel is the origin of the entire universe. (He said that) Your movements and activities are not understandable by the conditioned souls within the universe, and that You can be approached only by those engaged in Your pure devotional service.

3) O Lord Krsna, Akrura said that many different kinds of sacrifices and worshipping methods may be employed for the worship of Your lotus feet, for You possess many different names and forms and there are thus many paths to reach You. Because You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the demigods are all parts of You, the rivers of different worshipping procedures may flow into the ocean which is Yourself.

4) O Lord Krsna, Akrura said that Your limbs are the shelter for the entire universe, and the myriad of universes are all contained within the cave of Your abdomen. He said that with the glorious fame of Your beautiful and opulent incarnations, You grant spiritual bliss (to Your devotees) and remove the distresses (of material existence).

5) O Lord Krsna, eager for liberation, and humbly begging for Your mercy, Akrura offered these prayers to You. Bestowing on him a small fragment of Your mercy, You gave to him devotional service in pure love of God, as well as the association of Your saintly devotees.

6) O Lord Krsna, Although You cruelly neglected the gopis, Akrura offered these formal dry prayers to You. O ocean of amazing qualities, You asked Your uncle Akrura why he had become amazed.
