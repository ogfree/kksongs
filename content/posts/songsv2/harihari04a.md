**LYRICS:**

(1)  
hari hari! biphale janama gońāinu  
manuṣya-janama pāiyā, rādhā-kṛṣṇa nā bhajiyā,  
jāniyā śuniyā biṣa khāinu

(2)  
golokera prema-dhana, hari-nāma-sańkīrtana,  
rati nā janmilo kene tāy  
saḿsāra-biṣānale, dibā-niśi hiyā jwale,  
jurāite nā koinu upāy

(3)  
brajendra-nandana jei, śacī-suta hoilo sei,  
balarāma hoilo nitāi  
dīna-hīna jata chilo, hari-nāme uddhārilo,  
tāra śākṣī jagāi mādhāi

(4)  
hā hā prabhu nanda-suta, vṛṣabhānu-sutā-juta,  
koruṇā karoho ei-bāro  
narottama-dāsa koy, nā ṭheliho rāńgā pāy,  
tomā bine ke āche āmāra

**WORD FOR WORD TRANSLATION: [Hari Hari Biphale Janama Gonainu](http://kksongs.org/synonym/h/harihari04a.html)**

**TRANSLATION**

1) O Lord Hari I have spent my life uselessly. Having obtained a human birth and having net worshiped Radha and Krsna, I have knowingly drunk poison.

2) The treasure of divine love in Goloka Vrndavana has descended as the congregational chanting of Lord Hari's holy names. Why did my attraction for that chanting never come about? Day and night my heart burns from the fire of the poison of worldliness, and I have not taken the means to relieve it.

3) Lord Krsna, who is the son of the King of Vraja, became the son of Saci (Lord Caitanya), and Balarama became Nitai. The holy name delivered all those souls who were lowly and wretched. The two sinners Jagai and Madhai are evidence of this.

4) O Lord Krsna, son of Nanda, accompanied by the daughter of Vrsabhanu, please be merciful to me now. Narottama Dasa says, "O Lord, please do not push me away from Your reddish lotus feet, for who is my beloved except for You?"
