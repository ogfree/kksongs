**TRANSLATION**

1) O Krsna who went to King Bhismaka's kingdom filled with many visiting kings, O Krsna worshiped by the hosts of demigods, O prideless Krsna,

2) O Krsna who delighted the people of Mathura, O Krsna whose glory tore apart Your enemies, O Krsna who fled from Kalayavana, O Krsna who led Kalayavana to the moment of his death,

3) O Krsna who enjoys a festival of pastimes in Your own abode, O Krsna who kills the demons, O Krsna who stays in Dvaraka, O Krsna most learned at speaking joking words,

4) O Krsna who entered Mucukunda's abode, O Krsna who pretended to tremble in fear of Kalayavana, O Krsna who entered a mountain cave, O Krsna who was seen by the sleeping king,

5) O Krsna who was followed by the yavana king, O Krsna who hid from the yavana king, O Krsna who was merciful to Mucukunda, O Krsna whose effulgence illumined the darkness,

6) O Krsna who used Mucukunda's glance as a weapon to kill Kalayavana, O Krsna whom Mucukunda's heart yearned to see, O Krsna who mercifully fulfills Your devotees' desires,

7) O Krsna who killed millions of yavana soldiers in battle, O Krsna who won their booty, O Krsna who was pursued by Jarasandha, O Krsna who left the booty behind,

8) O Krsna who desired to flee from Jarasandha, who was eager to defeat You, O Krsna who climbed to the summit of Mount Pravarsana and then jumped from it to the ground,

9) O auspiciousness of the the Yadava's city in the ocean, O Krsna glorified by everyone in all the worlds, O Krsna who stays in Vraja, O son of Vraja's king, glory to You!
