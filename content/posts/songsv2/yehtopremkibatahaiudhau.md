**LYRICS:**

(1)

yeh to prema kī bāta hai udhau

bandagī tere bas kī nahīń hai

yahāń sarade ke hońṭh hai saude

aśiqī itnī sastī nahīń hai

(2)

premawāloń ne kab waqt pūchā

unkī pūjā sunale he udhau

yah dam dam meń hote hai pūjā

sar jhukānā ke fursat nahīń hai

(3)

jo asar hai meń mastī meń ḍūbe

unhe kyā paravāha zindagī kī

jo utartī hai kartī yeh mastī

voh haqīqat ke mastī nahīń hai

(4)

jiske nazaroń meń hai śyāma pyāre

woh to rehte hai jaga se nihāre

jiske nazaroń meń mohana samāye

woh nazar phir tarastī nahīń hai

**TRANSLATION**

1) This is on the topic of Divine Love, O Udhau! This is not a topic you will be able to understand. Here, the business of understanding Krsna is by lips. Love is not so cheap here!

2) When have lovers ever asked for worship? O Udhau, please listen! Here, worship here is done in excitement and vigor! Here, lowering and bowing heads does not cause grief!

3) The effect of drowning in such fun, who can care about life? If one indulges in material life and tries to examine our fun, then this fun is not real.

4) Whomever’s eyes have the desire for my loving Syama, they live in the world without any cares of it. For whoever’s eyes is buried in the love of Krsna, those eyes will never get thirsty again!
