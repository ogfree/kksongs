**TRANSLATION**

O Krsna! Please allow my mind to immediately yield to Your lotus flowerlike feet, just as the flamingo enters into the labyrinth of the lotus flowers' stems. When at the moment of my last breath my throat becomes constricted by the action of the bodily humors air, bile, and phlegm, how will I be able to remember You?

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

Srila Prabhupada sang this particular verse in his recordings. In fact, the RKC radio in Italy uses this as the “commercial” sound.  Mahatma Dasa sang this verse in side one of his 1989 album Our Only Shelter. Therefore, this verse was posted separately. It was sung in Raga Bhairavi or Katyayani in both versions.
