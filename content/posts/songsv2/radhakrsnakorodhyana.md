**LYRICS:**

(1)

rādhā-kṛṣṇa koro dhyāna, svapne-o nā bolo āna,

prema vinā āna nāhi cāu

yugala kiśora prema, yeno lakṣa-bāna hema,

ārati pirīti rase dhyāu

(2)

jala vinu yeno mīna, duḥka pāy āyu-hīna

prema vinu ei mata bhakta

cātaka jalada gati, emata ekānta rīti,

yei jāne sei anurakta

(3)

lubdha bhramara yeno, cakora candrikā teno,

pativratā-janera yeno pati

anyatra nā cole mana, yeno daridrera hema,

eimata prema-bhakti rīti

(4)

viṣaya garala-maya, tā'te māno sukha-caya,

sei sukha duḥka kori māno

govinda viṣaya rasa, sańga koro tāra dāsa,

prema bhakti satya kori jāno

(5)

madhye madhye āche duṣṭa, dṛṣṭi kori hoy ruṣṭa

guṇa viguṇa kori māne

govinda vimukha jana, sphūrti nahe heno dhana

laukika koriyā saba jāne

(6)

ajñāna vimukha yoto, nāhi loy sata mata

ahańkāre nā jāne āpanā

abhimānī bhakti hīna, jaga mājhe sei dīna,

vṛthā tāra aśeṣa bhāvanā

(7)

āra saba parihari, parama īśvara hari,

sevo mana! prema kori āśa

eka vraja rāja pure, govinda rasika vare

koroho sadāi abhilāṣa

(8)

narottama dāsa kohe, sadā mora prāṇa dahe,

heno bhakta sańga nā pāiyā

abhāgyera nāhi ora, michāi hoinu bhora,

duḥka rahu antare jāgiyā

**TRANSLATION**

1) Meditate on Sri Sri Radha-Krsna.  Don't desire anything else, even in your dreams.  The treasure of love for the youthful Divine Couple is more valuable than gold purified in ten thousand flames.

2) As a fish without water suffers and dies, so a devotee perishes without love for the Divine Couple.  As a cataka bird carefully follows the clouds, so a devotee loves the Divine Couple.

3) As a bumblebee yearns for lotus flowers, a cakora bird yearns for moonlight, a chaste wife yearns for her husband, and a pauper yearns for money, a devotee yearns to attain love for the Divine Couple.

4) The happiness of the senses is full of poison.  Pride does not bring happiness.  These things do not bring happiness.  They bring only pain.  Taste the nectar of serving Lord Govinda.  Associate with His devotees.  Learn the truth of loving devotional service.

5) The treasure of divine love does not present itself before the demons that turn their backs on Lord Govinda, become angry when they see the devotees, and think the devotees are ordinary people.

6) These unfortunate fools cannot understand the truth.  Proud, bewildered by false-ego, and empty of devotion for the Lord, they are the poorest and most wretched people in the world.  All their thoughts are empty and without meaning.

7) O mind, renounce everything and desire only to love and serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Hari. Lord Govinda, the best of them who taste transcendental nectar, stays in King Nanda's house.  Desire Him alone.

8) Narottama dasa says: Because I cannot attain the association of devotees, my life is like a burning fire.  No one is unfortunate as I.  I am overcome by material illusion, and great pain is beginning to waken in my heart.
