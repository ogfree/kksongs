**TRANSLATION**

Invocation: Lord Hari is the Supreme Whole.

1) O Manyu, the persons who worship You, who is like a thunderbolt, the destroyer of enemies, enjoys all power and strength combined, may we overcome our enemies with You as our friend, invigorating and strong.

2) Manyu is Indra, He is Varuna and Agni. Those of human descent praise Manyu. Protect us Manyu, be pleased with our austerities.

3) Come to us Manyu, you who are the strongest of the strong. With austerity as your companion, overthrow our enemies. Give us spiritual wealth, O slayer of enemies, adversaries and foes.

4) Give us strength in battle, Manyu, O you who posses overpowering strength. You are self-existent, furious, the overthrower of enemies, the beholder of all, enduring, and vigorous.

5) O Lord Manyu, not taking part in Your worship (not offering oblations at the sacrifice) I was forced to retreat before my enemies. I avoided and neglected Your worship. Yet please be kind and give me strength.

6) I am Yours! Come to me, turn Your face towards me! O resister of the foes, sustainer of all, Manyu, the holder of a thunderbolt, come to me. Let us slay the demons, and help Your devotees.

7) Approach me by my right side and let us slay a multitude of foes. I offer You the best part of the Soma juice, let us drink it together in privacy.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

Manyu is a form of Lord Nrsimha, the personification and presiding Deity of anger.
