**LYRICS:**

(refrain)

ab kī ṭeka hamārī

lāja rākho giridhārī, giridhārī re

(1)

jaisī lāj rākhī arjuna kī

bhārata yuddha majhārī

sārathi hoke ratha ko hāńkho

cakra sudarśana dhārī re

bhaktan kī ṭeka na ṭārī

(2)

jaisī lāj rākhī draupadī kī

honana dīni udhārī

khecaka khecaka do bhujha thāke

duḥśāsana paci hārī re

cīra barāyo murārī

(3)

sura dāsa kī lāja rākho

ab kahe rakhawārī

rādhe rādhe śrīvara pyāro

śrī vṛṣabhānu dulārī re

śarana tak āyo tumhārī

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain): Please listen to my humble prayer. Please protect me, Oh lifter of Govardhana Hill! Oh Giridhari!

1) Just as You protected Arjuna, during the Mahabharata war. You were the charioteer of Arjuna, Oh beholder of the Sudarsana Cakra! You truly honored Your devotees.

2) Just as You protected Draupadi when she was helpless. You defeated by Duhsasana, by supplying Draupadi a long chain of clothes. His two arms got tired and he became unconscious by Murari’s power.

3) Please protect Sura Dasa, Oh protector of devotees. You are the lover of the beloved of Srimati Radharani, the beloved daughter of King Vrsabhanu. I have come to take shelter of You.

**Remarks/ Extra Information****:**

This can be sung in Raga Misra Kafi in either Bhajani or Dipchandi Tala.

This song was popularized by Dilraj Kaur’s ISKCON recording “Prabhu Vandana.”
