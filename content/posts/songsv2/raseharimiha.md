**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) My mind remembers Lord Hari. He joked and performed his lila during the rasa.

1) His infatuating flute resounded with honeyed tones like the nectar from his quavering lower-lip; an ear ornament was tremulous on his cheek as his head moved, \[tremulous\] at the corner of his quivering eye.

2) His hair was surrounded with a ring of lovely peacock-tail feathers with moon-eyes; \[in\] his lovely robe \[He\] was like a dark cloud colored with many rainbows; my mind remembers Hari.

3) He had an eager desire for kisses from the mouths of the gopis; the blossom of his honeyed lower-lip is like the bandhuvija \[flower\], \[he was\] beautiful on account of his radiant smile; my mind remembers Hari.

4) A thousand cowherd girls were encircled by the shoots which are his very bristled arms; upon his chest and hands and feet, the darkness was dispelled by the rays of his pearl ornaments; my mind remembers Hari.

5) His forehead had a mark of sandal on it which surpassed the moon moving in a cluster of clouds; his broad chest was mean to crush the hearts. my mind remembers Hari.

6) His cheeks were adorned with enchanting ear rings of makaras made of jewels; he was noble; he had a yellow robe; he was followed by a great retinue of sages, men, spirits, and gods; my mind remembers Hari.

7) He was met beneath the splendid kadamba \[tree\] allaying fear of the evil of the Kali Yuga; exciting me too somehow; in my imagination; with his gaze which is like the tremulous; restless love-god; my mind remembers Hari.

8) The song of Sri Jayadeva has the beauty of the Enemy-of-Madhu, infatuating, so beautiful; it is exactly suitable for the virtuous for remembrance of the feet of Hari.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**
