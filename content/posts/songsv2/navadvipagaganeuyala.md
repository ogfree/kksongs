**LYRICS:**

(1)

nabadvipa-gagane uyala dina rati

ghana rase sincala sthala-cara jati

(2)

dekha dekha gaura jalada abatara

barikhaye preme amiya anibara

(3)

tad-abadhi jaga-bhari dura-dina bhora

hari-rase dagamaga jaga-jana bhora

(4)

nacata unamata bhakata mayura

abhakata bheka royata jale bura

(5)

bhakati lata tina bhubana beyapa

uttama adhama saba prema-phala paba

(6)

kirtana kulisa roga banacari

jnanase o ghana garaje bidari

(7)

cita bilopi kasila karama bhujanga

niramila o kali-mada dahana taranga

(8)

tapita cataka tirapita bhela

dasa-dika sabahum nadi rahi gela

(9)

dubala abani kaho nahi thama

samsarera acale rahalu balarama

**TRANSLATION**

1) Staying in the sky of Navadvipa, a monsoon cloud day and night showers nectar rains on the moving and unmoving beings.

2) Look! Look! The monsoon cloud of Lord Gaura has descended to this world! Without stop It showers the nectar of ecstatic spiritual love.

3) Now the whole world is filled with rain. Now the people are plunged in the nectar of Lord Krsna’s glories.

4) Now the wild-peacock devotees dance. Even the beggar non-devotees are plunged in the nectar waters.

5) Nourished by the rains, the vine of bhakti grows very large and fills the three worlds. Everyone, from the highest to the lowest, will taste the fruit of divine love that grows on that vine.

6) The monsoon cloud of Lord Gaura hurls a thunderbolt of kirtana, a thunderbolt that falls on the imposter sannyasis. The roaring cloud hurls another thunderbolt, a thunderbolt that breaks the impersonalists into pieces.

7) Another thunderbolt cleaves in two the snake of karma’s heart. Then Kali-yuga’s bewildering illusions are drowned in that monsoon’s flooding waves of nectar.

8) The thirsty cataka birds of the devotees are all delighted by drinking the nectar falling from that monsoon cloud. Now the ten directions are filled with flooding rivers of nectar.

9) The whole world is plunged in the flooding nectar of ecstatic spiritual love. There is no escape. Only Balarama dasa has escaped. Standing on the dry mountain peak of repeated birth and death, he has escaped that flood.
