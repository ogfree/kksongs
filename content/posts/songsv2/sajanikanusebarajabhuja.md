**LYRICS:**

(Refrain)

sajani kānu se baraja-bhujańga

so majhu hṛdaya          candana-ruhe lāgala

bhāgala dharama-bihańga

(1)

kājara bharama        timira janu tanu-ruci

nibasa-i kuñja-kuṭira

bamsi nisase        madhura bisa ugara-i

gati ati kuṭila su-dhīra

(2)

locana-koṇe      paḍata yaba nāgarī

raha-i nā pāra-i thira

kuñcita aruṇa       adhare dhari piba-i

kulabatī barata-samīra

(3)

eka aparūpa      nayane biṣa tākara

meḍhaye daśanaka daḿśe

biṣa auṣadha        biṣa abadhārala

gobinda-dāsa paraśaḿse

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) O gopi\-friend, Krsna is a snake slithering about the land of Vraja. The Krsna\-snake coils itself around the sandal-tree of my heart and makes the bird of dharma fly away.

1) He stays in a forest-cottage. The splendor of His body is the like darkness of black kajjala. From the sound of His flute a sweet poison arises. His clever ways are very crooked.

2) When Krsna glances at her from the corner of His eye, no graceful girl has the power to remain steady and peaceful. With His reddish pursed lips, Krsna sips away the saintly gopis' pious vows, vows carried to Him by the fluttering breeze.

3) Krsna's wonderful poison-glance bites the gopis. The nectar poison of that glance now flows within them. In this way Govinda dasa praises Lord Krsna.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is sung in Raga Sri or Raga Gandhara.
