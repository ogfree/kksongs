**LYRICS:**

(1)

āju gorācānda gaṇa-saha gopaveśe

tile tile adhika vibhola se nā rase

(2)

hāṣe laha laha cāhe gadādhara pāne

vahaye ānanda vāri dhāra du' nayane

(3)

mukunda mādhava vāsu ullāsa hiyāya

rādhikā janama carita sabhe gāya

(4)

bāje khola karatāla bhuvana-maṅgala

māce paṅhu dharaṇī karaya ṭalamala

(5)

gaurīdāsa ādi nāce bhāra kari' kāndhe

dekhite se gopa-veśa kebā thire bāndhe

(6)

kata sāthe nāce puṇdarīka vidyānidhi

chaḍāiyā navanī haladī dudha dadhi

(7)

nitāi advaita śrīvāsādi raṅga dekhi'

bhāse sukha samudre phirāte nāre āṅkhi

(8)

kī nārī puruṣa dhāya ei raṅge dekhite

dāṇḍāiyā aṅgane cāhaye cāribhite

(9)

dekhi' goparūpera mādhurī anupama

keha kahe, - 'nāce i'ki kanakera kāma'

(10)

deva-gaṇa nācaye kusuma vṛṣṭhi kari'

jaya jaya diyā raṅge nāce narahari

**TRANSLATION**

1) Today, Goracanda, accompanied by His associates and donning a cowherd's dress, gradually became completely overwhelmed with rasa.

2) He laughed and rocked to and fro' while glancing towards Gadadhara with tears of bliss streaming from His two eyes.

3) Greatly delighted, Mukunda, Madhava and Vasu sing the pastimes of Radhika's birth.

4) The sounds of the khol and the karatalas filled the world with auspiciousness, while the dancing of myriad feet made the earth tremble.

5) Gauridasa and others dance while carrying pots on their shoulders. Seeing their cowherd dress, who can sit quietly?

6) Among them, Pundarika Vidyanidhi dances and snatches away butter, haldi, milk and yogurt.

7) Seeing the playful pastimes of Nitai, Advaita, Srivasa and the others, everyone floated in an ocean of happiness and couldn't take their eyes away.

8) Whether woman or man, everyone rushed to see these playfulness and stood inside the courtyard.

9) Seeing the cowherd boy's form full of matchless sweetness, someone said, 'What is this dancing golden treasure?'

10) The devas dance and rain down flowers. Rejoicing with 'jaya! jaya!' Narahari dances with sheer delight.
