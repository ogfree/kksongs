**TRANSLATION**

1) Overcome with ecstatic love, Lord Gaura dances. One moment He chants, "Hari!" The next moment He is rapt in thinking of Vrndavana. Moment after moment He accepts the mood of Sri Radha, the queen of Lord Krsna’s life.

2) A garment the color of yavaka is splendidly wrapped about His waist. Sometimes He runs to the Ganga, declaring, "The Yamuna!"

3) The mridangas play, "Ta tha-i! Ta tha-i!" The kartalas plays "Jhana jhana!" A Ganga of tears flows from Lord Gaura's lotus eyes. A forest-garland swings to and fro on His neck.

4) Lord Gauracandra is the root of all bliss. He is very kind to the devotees, who have no wealth but Him. Dina Krsna dasa yearns to attain the shade of His lotus feet.
