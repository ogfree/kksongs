**LYRICS:**

(1)

Why does Nanda's graceful teenage son,

Whose charming clever joking always sends

The gopas into fits of laughter shun

The surabhi cows and all His cheerful friends?

(2)

Why does His flower-twined flute lay on the ground

Untouched and why does He not speak a word?

Why does He not make a single sound,

And why does He leave His lunch of fruit and curd?

(3)

Why does the fragrant forest grove not fill

Him with glorious feelings of delight?

Why does He sit alone on Govardhana Hill,

His form shaded from the sun's bright light?

(4)

Why is He motionless and pale and why

So sadly does He sigh and sigh and sigh?
