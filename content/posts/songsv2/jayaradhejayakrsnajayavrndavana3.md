**WORD FOR WORD TRANSLATION: [Jaya Radhe Jaya Krsna Jaya Vrndavana (III)](http://kksongs.org/synonym/j/jayaradhejayakrsnajayavrndavana3.html)**

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain): All glories to Sri Radha! All glories to Sri Krsna! All glories to their abode of Vrndavana! All glories to the gopis who are the jewel of the crown of the rasika mood.

1) In this ecstatic mood, Krsna sings “Radhe Radhe” and Radha sings “Syam Syam!” The Holy Name and the divine pair of Radhe Syam are my life and soul.

2) I only have one treasure within this life. The son of Nanda Maharaja, the enchanter of Cupid, and pleasure giver to Radharani are my life and soul.

3) Syama is the only person who I love, He is certainly my husband. My mind and body is perpetually immersed in Syama!

4) I am verily the maidservant of Srimati Radharani, who is the eternal queen of the eternal abode of Vrndavana.

5) My wish is to obtain a daily practice of doing eternal service in the eternal abode. Thus, I wish to keep my life in the way my master, Srimati Radharani, desires.
