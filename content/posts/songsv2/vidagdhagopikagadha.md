**TRANSLATION**

1) O Lord Krsna, O clever lion, understanding the intentions of the intelligent gopis, You expertly answered their three profound questions.

2) O Lord Krsna, (speaking to the gopis), You justified Your ingratitude and other so-called faults, and You mercifully described the most exalted and extraordinary state of pure love for You. O Lord, please protect me.

3) O Lord Krsna, You did not abandon the association of the gopis, and indeed, Your mind remained unsatisfied, even though You had given Yourself to them. You became very eager to benedict Your dear friends whose love for You had greatly increased during their separation from You.
