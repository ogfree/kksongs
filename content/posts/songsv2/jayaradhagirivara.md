jaya rādhā girivaradhārī

śrī nanda-nandana vṛṣabhānu dulārī

**TRANSLATION**

1) All glories to Srimati Radharani and Giri Vara Dhari! He is the son of Nanda Maharaja. She is the darling of Maharaja Vrisabhanu.

2) He wears a peacock feather in His crown and a shining flute is placed on His lips. Her long braids appear brilliant and She has a gentle smile on Her face.

  
3) Wearing a garland of forest flowers, His neck is splendorous. Wearing a shimmering pearl necklace, Her neck is splendorous.

  
4) His yellow garments enchant the minds of everyone within the universe. Her blue garments display a brilliant effulgence.

  
5) Jeweled ankle bells resound on Their reddish lotus feet. The mind of Krsna Dasa is illuminated by Their splendorous presence.
