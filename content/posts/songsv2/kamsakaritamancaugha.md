**TRANSLATION**

1) O Lord Krsna, all glories unto You. Although You were very eager to go to the arena full of raised platforms constructed by Kamsa, the elephant Kuvalayapida obstructed Your path.

2)  O Lord Krsna, please protect me. As powerful as a lion, You briefly played with the elephant Kuvalayapida, who was goaded on by his angry driver, and the killed him.

3) O Lord Krsna, killing the Kuvalayapida elephant and his driver, You pulled out the large tusk of that royal elephant and wielded it as a great weapon.
