**TRANSLATION**

1) Wherever Your glorious slender form shines, that place becomes like a wonderful lightning flash.

2) Wherever Your reddish feet walk, that place becomes like lotus petals.

3) Who is the fortunate girl I glance at, the girl that accompanies Me? I enjoy pastimes with that girl. That girl is My very life.

4) Wherever Your restless graceful eyebrows are raised, that place becomes like the rising waves of the Yamuna.

5) Wherever You cast restless glances from the corners of Your eyes, that place becomes like a forest of blue lotus flowers.

6) Wherever You gaze at Me with sweet smiles, that place becomes like a place filled with jasmine flowers and water-lilies.

7) Govinda dasa says: Charming Krsna sees these comparisons. Radha does not.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This is sung in Raga Suhai.
