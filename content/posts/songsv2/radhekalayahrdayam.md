**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) Radha, make Your heart kind. He who is the life of Gokula is now wounded, His heart pierced by the arrow of Your sidelong glance.

1) His flute has now become like a swan in the lotus flower of His left hand, a swan accustomed to sing the fifth note, but now silent out of great pain.

2) His forest-flower garland, once very fragrant and attractive to swarms of black bees, has now wilted and fallen from His neck to the forest ground.

3) O merciless girl, His transcendental form, which delights Sanatana Gosvami's heart, has now stopped its pastimes, and has now become very thin, slowly withering away in a mountain cave.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

Srila Jiva Gosvami explains that Visakha sings this song to Srimati Radharani. It is sung in Raga Malhara in Ektal.
