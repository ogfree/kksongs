**TRANSLATION**  
1) All glories, all glories, to the grand arati of Sri Giriraj! In the midst of Sri Gaura-mandal, it is benefitting the entire universe.

  
2) The hidden Govardhan graces Koladwip with its beauty. Now it has manifested its exquisite beauty in Sri Govinda Kunda.

  
3) There are groves of malati and madhavi flowers in its various caves. In these groves, Lord Hari plays His hidden, mysterious, and enchanting pastimes.

  
4) The incomparable beauty of the Kunda is like a reservoir of honey. Even Lord Indra and the divine Surabhi cow are rendering their service under the shining sun of good fortune.

5) Srila Bhakti Raksak Sridhar Dev-Goswami Maharaj has manifested the effulgent and enchanting devotional service to You.

6) Sri Chaitanya Saraswat Math is a beautiful place where devotees in the line of Srila Prabhupad Saraswati Thakur are always rendering their devotional service.

7) Remembering Sri Raghunath Das Goswami, they are continuously serving in an introspective mood.

8) All glories to the hidden Govarddhan, which is a reservoir of transcendental rasa. It is the refuge of the devotees who are following in the footsteps of Sri Rupa and Sri Raghunath.

9) By Your inconceivable glories and magnanimity, You have manifested Kuliya where all offences are forgiven. Day and night, the multitude of devotees circumambulate this place.

10) You are eternally manifested both as the worshipable Lord and as the servitor Lord. This fallen servant sees Your arati with great joy.
