**LYRICS:**

(1)

mandira bāhira kaṭhina kapāṭa

cala-ite śańkila pańkila bāṭa

(2)

taḿhi ati dūratara bādara dola

bari ki bāra-i nīla nicola

(3)

sundarī kaiche kayabi abhisāra

hari raha mānasa suradhunī pāra

(4)

ghana ghana jhana jhana bajara nipāta

śuna-ite śrabaṇe marame jari jā;ta

(5)

daśa diśa dāminī daha-i bithāra

hera-ite ucaka-i locana-bhāra

(6)

ithe yadi sundari tejabi geha

premaka lāgi upekhabi deha

(7)

gobinda-dāsa kaha ithe ki bicāra

chūṭala bāṇa kiye yatane nibāra

**TRANSLATION**

1) She departs from the house and the locked gate. Frightened, she flees on the muddy pathway.

2) A ferocious rainstorm blows with great winds. How can her black cloak keep out the torrents of rain?

3) How will this beautiful girl meet with Krsna? He is on the Manasa-ganga's farther shore.

4) "Jhanajhana!" Thunderbolts fall again and again. Hearing the thunder, she feels her ears and heart filled with flames of pain.

5) Flames of lightning flash in the ten directions. Watching, she fills her upraised wide-open eyes.

6) O beautiful girl, if you leave your home for love's sake, then for love's sake you should give up all worry for your own body.

7) Govinda dasa says: How can worry stop her now? When shot from the bow, how can an arrow be stopped?
