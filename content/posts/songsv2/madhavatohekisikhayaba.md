**LYRICS:**

(Refrain)

mādhaba tohe ki śikhāyaba āna

gorī ālāpi  śyāma naṭa sañcaru

aba tuhu bidagadha jāna

(1)

muralī milita adhara naba-pallaba

gāyata kata kata rāga

kulabatī ho-i   mandira choḍi āyalu

sahite nā pāri birāga

(2)

muralī choḍi achu madhura ālāpite

saba jana nāhi āna

kaṇṭhahi kaṇṭha meli abahi samujhiye

yati ṛṇe hota suṭhāma

(3)

nirajana jāni hṛdaye aba dhārabi

aichana guṇabatī bhāṣa

guṇijana-lāja  aiche nāhi hoyata

kahatahiḿ gobinda-dāsa

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) O Krsna, what more can I say to You? You are the most wise. You are the graceful dark dancer. With these melodies You call the fair gopis.

1) How many melodies do You play on the flute placed to Your flower-petal lips? Leaving their homes, the saintly gopis run to You. They have no power to stay away.

2) Putting down the flute, now You speak sweetly. No one is like You. Meeting the gopis closely, You declare that You are in debt to them.

3) Thus You speak to the saintly gopis. In this secluded place You will embrace them to Your heart. The saintly devotees are not shy to praise these pastimes. So speaks Govinda dasa.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is in Raga Dhanasri.
