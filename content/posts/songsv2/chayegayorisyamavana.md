(refrain)

chāye gayo rī śyāma vana vana basantī

vana vana basantī vana vana basantī

(1)

mora mukuṭa sira bhāra basantī

gala phūlana ko hāra basantī

manda manda muskāye gayo rī

śyāma vana vana basantī

(2)

dekha rahī saba ṭhāḍi sakhiyā

mana mohana se lāgi akhiyā

akhiyana śyāma samāyo gayo rī

śyāma vana vana basantī

(3)

saja rahe hai saba kuñja basantī

koyala kūhū kūhū kare basantī

baḿśī madhura bajāye gayo rī

śyāma vana vana basantī

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) The spring season, basanti, is spread throughout the forests

1) The peacock feather in Syama’s crown is basanti and the garland of forest flowers around His neck is basanti. Syama is smiling gently, and basanti is spread throughout the forests.

2) All the sakhis who are present there cannot resist falling in love with Him. Their eyes are riveted on Him, and basanti is spread throughout the forests.

3) The kunjas are decorated with basanti. The cuckoo’s sounds are basanti. Syama sweetly plays the flute, and basanti is spread throughout the forests.
