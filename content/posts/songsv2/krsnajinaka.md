**LYRICS:**

(1)

kṛṣṇa jinakā nāma hai, gokula jinakā dhāma hai

aise śrī bhagavāna ko (mere) barāmbāra praṇāma hai

(2)

yaśodā jinakī maiyā hai, nanda jī bāpaiyā hai

aise śrī gopāla ko (mere) bārambāra praṇāma hai

(3)

rādhā jinakī jāyā hai, adbhuta jinakī māyā hai

aise śrī ghana-śyāma ko (mere) bārambāra praṇāma hai

(4)

lūṭa lūṭa dadhi mākhana khāyo, gvāla-bāla sańga dhenu carāyo

aise līlā-dhāma ko (mere) bārambāra praṇāma hai

(5)

drupada sutā ko lāja bacāyo, grāha se gaja ko phanda chuḍāyo

aise kṛpā-dhāma ko (mere) barāmbāra praṇāma hai

(6)

kuru pāṇḍava ko yuddha macāyo, arjuna ko upadeśa sunāyo

aise dīna-nātha ko (mere) bārambāra praṇāma hai

(final chant)

bhaja re! bhaja govinda gopāla hare

rādhe govinda, rādhe govinda, rādhe govinda

rādhe gopala, rādhe gopala, rādhe gopala

aise śrī bhagavāna ko (mere) bārambāra praṇāma hai

**TRANSLATION**

1) He whose name is Krsna, and whose abode is Gokula – unto such a Supreme Personality of Godhead, I offer my most humble obeisances, again and again.

2) He whose mother is Yasoda, and whose father is Nandaji – unto such a cowherd boy named Gopala, I offer my most humble obeisances, again and again.

3) He whose Beloved if Radha, and whose illusory energy is very amazing – unto He whose splendorous complexion is the color of the fresh raincloud, I offer my most humble obeisances, again and again.

4) He who sneaks around to steal yogurt and butter, then hides to eat it, and who tends the cows in the company of His cowherd boyfriends – unto He who is the reservoir of playful pastimes, I offer my most humble obeisances, again and again.

5) He who prevented the dishonoring of the daughter of King Drupada, and who delivered the elephant Gajendra from the grasp of the alligator – unto He who is the abode of all compassion, I offer my most humble obeisances, again and again.

6) He who caused the great war between the Kurus and the Pandavas, and who spoke divine instructions to Arjuna on the battlefield – unto He who is the Lord of all helpless fallen souls, I offer my most humble obeisances, again and again.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

A variation of Verse 3 is as follows:

rādhā jinakī chāyā hai, kṛṣṇajī kanhaiyā hai

aise śrī ghana-śyāma ko (mere) bārambāra praṇāma hai

Krsna’s shadow is Srimati Radharani. Krsna is Kanhaiya. Unto the Lord whose splendorous complexion is the color of a raincloud, I offer my humble obeisances, again and again.
