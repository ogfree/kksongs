**LYRICS:**

(1)

If you want to look in the mysteries of life

You’ve had enough of serving the senses and the mind

All that you’re doing only helps to bring you down

There must have been something higher than what you have found

Ignorance has set the pace in this degraded human race

Running, running, running out of time

This use of human life is such a crime

Within these…

(Refrain)

Bubbles in a cosmic ocean

The rajas in the sanding sea

Apparitions dancing before our faulty visions

Simply flashes in a cosmic dream

Reality is not what it seems

(2)

If you want to look in the mysteries of life

Understanding who formed the universe is energized?

How has the whole creation taken place?

Is there any people beyond this time and space?

The answers are here, the human nature is very clear

Just understand that true identity.

Being servant spirit souls eternally

Not just…

(Refrain)

Bubbles in a cosmic ocean

The rajas in the sanding sea

Apparitions dancing before our faulty visions

Simply flashes in a cosmic dream

Reality is not what it seems

(3)

If you want to understand the truth of what is life

What lies beyond this birth and death, how can I realize?

The nature of the self revealed, tell me who I am?

The spirit soul engaged in a master mind and plan

Who’s controlling me? The humans found reality

The mystery revealed by the wise

Enlightened associate through the Lord’s disguise

Beyond these…

(Refrain)

Bubbles in a cosmic ocean

The rajas in the sanding sea

Apparitions dancing before our faulty visions

Simply flashes in a cosmic dream

Reality is not what it seems

Bubbles in a cosmic ocean

The rajas in the sanding sea

Apparitions dancing before our faulty visions

Simply flashes in a cosmic dream

It’s all about to burst at the seas
