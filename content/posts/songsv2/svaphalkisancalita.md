**TRANSLATION**

1) O Lord Krsna, when Akrura signaled the horses to move, the gopis surrounded the chariot and blocked the path. You became greatly aggrieved by the loud crying of Mother Yasoda, and You silently stood there with Nanda Maharaja and the other cowherd men. O Lord, I offer respectful obeisances unto You.

2) O Lord Krsna, thousands of gopis cried bitterly, some fainted, some died, and one went insane at the prospect of separation from you.

3) O Lord Krsna, the throats of hundreds of gopis were broken with great sounds of lamentation, and many gopis fell down in the lap of the road (to prevent the passing of the chariot). O Lord, please be merciful to me.

4) O Lord Krsna, You glorified the gopis, whose lives remained intact only be carefully binding them with the ropes of hope (for Your return). Those gopis became greatly agitated with distress when they saw the path to Mathura. O Lord, all glories unto you.
