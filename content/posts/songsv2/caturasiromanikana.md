(Refrain)

catura-śiromaṇi kāna

heri yamunā-jalamanasija mātala

pūrala muralī niśāna

bhora manorathe calala bipina pathe

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) Glancing at the Yamuna's waters, Lord Krsna, the jewel of the wise, filled His flute with music. Now He was wild with Kamadeva's desires.

1) How many games did the king of dancers play and play with His gopa friends? Then, pushed by a certain desire, He left the boys' company and walked alone on the forest path.

2) With that flute-music He created a boat, a boat made of jewels, pearls, and coral, a boat with decks made of diamonds, a boat with seat after seat made of gold and jewels, a boat with many small bells that jangled as it moved.

3) Lord Krsna, the wise king of heroes, entered that boat and set out from the Yamuna's banks. Govinda dasa says: As the boat moved, its many small bells jangled. 

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This is sung in Raga Dhanasri.
