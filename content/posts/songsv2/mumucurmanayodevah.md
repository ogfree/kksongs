(1)

mumucur munayo devāḥ

sumanāḿsi mudānvitāḥ

mandaḿ mandaḿ jaladharā

jagarjur anusāgaram

(2)

niśīthe tama-udbhūte

jāyamāne janārdane

devakyāḿ deva-rūpiṇyāḿ

viṣṇuḥ sarva-guhā-śayaḥ

āvirāsīd yathā prācyāḿ

diśīndur iva puṣkalaḥ

**TRANSLATION**

1-2) The demigods and great saintly persons showered flowers in a joyous mood, and clouds gathered in the sky and very mildly thundered, making sounds like those of the ocean's waves. Then the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu, who is situated in the core of everyone's heart, appeared from the heart of Devakī in the dense darkness of night, like the full moon rising on the eastern horizon, because Devakī was of the same category as Śrī Kṛṣṇa.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

These verses are popularized by the recording “Dasi\-Prayers by Women” by Karnamrita Devi Dasi.
