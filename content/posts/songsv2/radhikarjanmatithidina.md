**LYRICS:**

(1)

rādhikāra janma-tithi dina jāni

vraje keho dhṛti dharite nāre

nanda yaśodādi adhika ullāse

āisena vṛsabhānupura ghare

(2)

vṛṣabhānu nande āgusari ghare

āne yaśodāya kṛttikā laiyā

dadhi-haridrādi chaḍa'yā aṅgane

nāce gopa-gaṇa haraṣa haiyā

(3)

bāje keta bhāti - vādya kulāhale

keho kāru kathā nā śune kāṇe

pāiyā samaya kāla alakhita

cāhi' rahe rāimukhera pāne

(4)

rādhā bidhu-mukhi śyāma-mukha-śobhā

heri' rahe nāre phirā'te aṅkhi

narahari bhaṇe - nā jāni ki rasa

prakāśaye duṅhu doṅhāre dekhi'

**TRANSLATION**

1) On Radhika’s birthday no one in Vraja could remain peaceful. With great joy Nanda, Yasoda, and the others all went to Brishabhanu’s home.

2) Vrsabhanu greeted Nanda, and Kirtida greeted Yasoda. In the courtyard the cowherd people showered each other with yogurt, turmeric, and other similar substances. Joyfully they danced.

3) There was a great tumult of splendid instrumental music, so loud that no one could hear any words of conversation. At that moment, unseen by others, Krsna entered a private room, where he gazed at Radhika’s beautiful face.

4) Moon-faced Radha gazed at the splendid handsomeness of dark Krishna’s face. She could not turn her eyes away. Narahari Das says, “I can’t imagine what nectar the divine couple tasted as they gazed at each other.”
