**LYRICS:**

(Refrain)

pekhalu gauracandra anupama

yacata yaka mula  nahi tri-bhubane

aiche ratana hari-nama

(1)

koi kahe aparupa  prema-sudha-nidhi

ko-i kahata rasa seha

ko-i kahata iha   so-i kalapa-taru

majhu\-mane hota sandeha

(2)

yo eka sindhu  bindu nahi yacata

para-basa jalada-sancara

manasa abadhi bahuta kalapa-taru

koi achu karuna para

(3)

yachu caritamata  sruti-pathe sancaru

hrdaya-sarobara-pura

umada-i nayana  adhama-maru bhumahi

hoyata pulaka-ankura

(4)

namahi yanka   tapa saba medhaye

tahe ki canda-upama

bhana ghanasyama  dasa nahi hoyata

koti koti eku thama

**TRANSLATION**

Refrain: The person I saw is peerless Lord Gauracandra. He does not ask for anything in the three worlds. He wishes only the jewel of Lord Krsna's holy name.

1) One person says: “This is an ocean of the wonderful nectar of ecstatic spiritual love.” Another persons says: “This is nectar personified.” Another says: “This is a kalpa-taru tree.” In my heart a doubt now arises.

2) He does not ask for even a single drop of water from the ocean of material happiness. He will accept only the water that falls from the raincloud of spiritual love. He is a kalpa-taru tree that fulfills the desires of every heart. Who is limitlessly merciful like Him?

3) The nectar of His pastimes flows along the pathway of the ears, enters the lake of the heart, exits from the eyes in the form of tears, irrigates the dry land of the limbs, and makes to sprout the plants of the bodily hairs standing erect in ecstasy.

4) His holy name cools the burning sufferings of this world. Shall we compare His holy name to the cooling moon? Ghanasyama dasa says: “No. His holy name is like millions and millions of moons standing in one place.”
