**TRANSLATION**

1) Laksmi devi's glance always rests upon the king of lions. He is the destroyer of material existance and the rocky resting place of Garuda. His complexion is that of the color of sandal wood and His splendor is that of milk. I offer my obeisances to the ocean of mercy, Ahobala Nrisimha.

2) He is without beginning or end. He is unborn, unperishable and unmeasurable. He is the original Lord and His eyes are like flames brilliant as the sun and the moon. He is like an intoxicated honey bee searching for the nectar of the face of Laksmi devi. I offer my obeisances to the ocean of mercy, Ahobala Nrsimha.

3) Him the beloved Lord, possesses effulgent manes made of millions and millions of dazzling hairs. His body is decorated by armlets, necklaces and diamond earrings. His wonderful face is adorned with a peacock feather. I offer my obeisances to the ocean of mercy, Ahobala Nrsimha.

4) Him the all auspicious Nrsimha appears in different forms such as Varaha or Vamana. He Whose heart is always absorbed in a sporting mood, is worshipped by the king of the devas. Although He is the personification of terror, He makes the mind of the self-realized joyful. I offer my obeisances to the ocean of mercy, Ahobala Nrsimha.

5) His lotus feet is the source of the Mandakini river (Akasha Ganga or celestial Ganga). His body is brilliant and He constantly enjoys in His own abode. His lotus feet are decorated by the flowers of Tulasi and Mandara (one of the 5 celestial flowers). I offer my obeisances to the ocean of mercy, Ahobala Nrsimha.

6) He is the protector of youthful Krishna in the land of Tulasi. He possesses a huge form. He enjoys amorous sports with Bhu and Sri. He is the Lord of all the mantras and He destroys and humiliates the foolish danavas. I offer my obeisances to the ocean of mercy, Ahobala Nrsimha.
