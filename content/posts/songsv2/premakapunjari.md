**LYRICS:**

(1)

premaka puñjarī, śuna guṇa mañjarī

tuhuń se sakala śubha dāi

tohāri guṇagaṇa cintai anukṣaṇa

majhu mana rahala bikāi

(2)

hari hari kabe mora śubha dina hoya

kiśora kiśorī pada sevana sampada

tuyā sane milaba moye

(3)

herai kātara jana kuru kṛpā nirakhaṇa

nija guṇe pūravi āśe

tuhuń nava ghana vinu vindu varikhaṇe punu

ko puraba pipya piyāse

(4)

tuhuń se agati-gati niścaya niścaya ati

majhu mana iha parimāṇe

kahai kātara bhāṣe punaḥ punaḥ śrīnivāse

karuṇāya karu avadhāne

**TRANSLATION**

1) O Guna Manjari, the embodiment of divine love, please listen to my prayer. As I ponder upon your countless qualities, my mind simply becomes enchanted by you.

2) O Hari! When will that auspicious day be mine? O Guna Manjari! When will I be able to achieve the treasure of serving the Youth Couple along with you?

3) Seeing me as a distressed soul, please constantly bestow your mercy upon me. Due to your own magnanimous nature, please fulfill my desire. Besides you, who, like the water laden cloud of the monsoon, will quench my thirst? You are undoubtedly the hope for the hopeless. In my heart I am completely convinced about that. I beg you to kindly look upon me with your tender eyes shining with sympathy.

4) Without a doubt, you are the ultimate goal for the most fallen souls. My heart indeed concludes this. Therefore, again and again, Srinivasa speaks with broken speech, “Please manifest your mercy upon me!”
