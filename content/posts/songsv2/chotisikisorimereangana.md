(1)

choṭī sī kisorī mere āńgana meń ḍole re

pāva me pāyaliyā bāke jham-jhamā-jham bole re

hāsa hāsa ke batāve boto rādhā mero nāma re

(3)

maine bāse pūchī lālī kahā tero gāva re

mīṭhī mīṭhī bole mose barasāno mero gāva re

(4)

maine bāse pūchī lālī, kauna tero sasurāla re

śaramāke yo bole mose jāvaṭa grāma sasurāla re

(5)

maine bāse pūchī lālī kauna tero bharatāra re

muskarāke bolī mose śyāma mero bharatāra re

maine bāse pūchī lālī, khāogī kā mākhana

āhā, āhā bole, mere āge pīche ḍole re

candrasakhī bhaja bāla kṛṣṇa chavi

sapane me āke mose mīṭḥī mīṭḥī bole re

pāva me pāyaliyā bāke jham-jhamā-jham bole re
