**LYRICS:**

(1)

hera dekhiya    nayana bhariya

ki ara puchasi ane

nadiya-nagare  sacira mandire

candera udaya dine

(2)

kiye lakhabana   karila-kancana

rupera nichani gora

sacira udara  jalada nikasila

sthira bijuri para

(3)

kata bidhu-bara badana ujora

nisi disi sama sobhe

nayana-bhramara  sruti\-saroruhe

dhaya makaranda-lobhe

(4)

a-janu-lambita   bhuja su-balita

nabhi hema sarobara

kati kari-ari  uru hema-giri

e locana manohara

**TRANSLATION**

1) Look! Now that you have filled your eyes, what further questions do you have? In Nadiya-nagara, in Saci's house, in the daytime a moon shines.

2) Gold purified how many thousands of times shines as Gaura's fair body? From the monsoon-cloud of Saci's womb has come a stationary lightning-flash.

3) How many glorious moons shine as Gaura's face? Even at night they fill all the directions with light. Yearning to gather nectar, the black bees of His eyes fly to the lotus flowers of His ears.

4) His graceful arms reach to His knees. His navel is a gold lake. His waist is a lion's waist. His thighs are golden mountains. He charms Locana dasa's heart.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This could either be sung in Raga Vibhasa or Raga Todi.
