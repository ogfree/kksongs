**LYRICS:**

(1)

nagara bhramiyā āmāra gaura elo ghare

gaura elo ghare āmāra nitāi elo ghare

(2)

pāpī tāpī uddhāra diyā gaura elo ghare

pāpī tāpī uddhāra diyā nitāi elo ghare

(3)

nāma prema bilāiya gaura elo ghare

nāma prema bilāiya nitāi elo ghare

(4)

dhūla jhari’ śacī-mātā gaura kole kare

dhūla jhari’ padmāvatī nitāi kole kare

**TRANSLATION**

1) After roaming through the towns and villages, my Gauranga and my Nityananda came back home.

2) My Gaura-Nitai magnanimously delivered so many sinners suffering from the three-fold miseries and then came home.

3) Roaming about, Gaura and Nitai distributed prema through harinama, and then They returned home.

4) Gaura’s body was covered with dust. Seeing this, Saci Mata’s heart filled with gaura-prema. She removed the dust and took Him on her lap. Similarly, Padmavati-devi removed the dust from Nitai’s body and took Him in her lap.
