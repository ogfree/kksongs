**TRANSLATION**

1) O Krsna, Your childish attempt to speak was very charming and enchanting, and Your transcendental pastimes caused the residents of Vraja to become jubilant. You would wander here and there in the company of Your friends, the young protectors of the calves, although You would not go very far from Your home in Vraja.

2) O Krsna, accompanied by Lord Balarama and other cowherd boy friends, You delighted in performing various different pastimes in the gardens of Vrndavana. You are very fond of playing Your flute, upon which You produce an amazingly sweet sound.

3) O Krsna, Your charming and beautiful form bends in three places and the flute to Your lips. You are delighted to shoot (pebbles) with a sling-shot and You are very enthusiastic to play with a ball.

4) O Krsna, You and Your friends would imitate the activities of the bull-calves and the sounds of the grown-up bulls. You would enjoy mock-fighting with Your friends, and You would imitate the sounds of all the forest animals. All glories unto You.
