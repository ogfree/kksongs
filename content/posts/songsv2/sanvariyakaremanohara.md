**LYRICS:**

(refrain)

sāńvariyā kare manohāra hori ki rādhe āyī bahāra

(1)

abīra gulāla kī bhara bhara jholī

mukha mala ḍāro āyī horī

sāńvariyā pakaḍe hai āja

(2)

bṛja me gvāla bāla saba nāce

madhura muraliyā śyāma bajāve

pāyaliyā kare jhanakāra

(3)

rańga birańgī gopī ḍole

gārī deke mose hasa hasa bole

cudariyā pe rańga ki phuhāra

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) The season of the enchanting Holi festival has come, Sri Radhe!

1) Filling Your cloth with red powder-dye and applying it to His face, catch Your beloved today.

2) In Vraja all the cowherd boys are dancing Syama is playing the flute sweetly and His ankle bells are tinkling.

3) As He throws color on the gopis and playfully abuses them, their clothes become covered with color.
