**LYRICS:**

(Refrain)

iha madhu yāminī māhā

kāhe lāgi māna  dahane tanu dahi dahi

duhu mukha duhu nāhi cāha

(1)

uha purukha-bara  bidagadha-śekhara

e abicala kula-bālā

bihi yo nā jānalamadana ghaṭāyala

janu jaladhare bidhu-mālā

(2)

cānda udaye kiye  kumudinī mudita

cāndanī bimukha cakora

aichana yāminī  kabahu nā pekhiye

kiye bidhi mati bhora

(3)

duhu tanu paraśa  kṣaṇeka paraśahi

jaladhare dāminī-mālā

aichana kāminī  so su-purukha-bara

duhuka dulaha naba-bālā

(4)

sahacarī bacana   śuniyā duhu haraṣita

duhu mukha heri duhu hāsa

duhuka anubhaba  pūrala manoratha

gobinda-dāsa parakāśa

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) On this sweet springtime night why do You two make Your tongues burn with the flames of a lover's quarrel? Why do You two not even look at each other's faces?

1) Here is the best of males, the crown of the playful and wise. And here is a saintly faithful girl. Alas! Destiny does not know the greatness of Your love. You are like a monsoon cloud garlanded with a host of moons.

2) When the moon rises do the lotus flowers close their petals? When the glistening moonlight shines, do the cakora birds turn their faces from it? How have Your hearts become so bewildered that on a night like this you will not even look at each other?

3) You two should touch. For a moment the garland of lightning should touch the dark monsoon cloud. Here is a beautiful girl filled with love inside. And here is the best of charming boys. You two are a glorious teenage couple.

4) Hearing the gopi-friend's words, the divine couple became happy. Looking at each other's faces, They smiled. They felt Their every desire was at once fulfilled. Govinda dasa reveals these pastimes.
