(Refrain)

rādhe pathi muñca bhūri sambhramam abhisāre

cāraya caraṇāmburuhe dhīraḿ sukumāre

(1)

hanta na kim u mantharayasi santatam abhijalpam

danta-rocir antarayati santamasam analpam

(2)

santanu ghana-varṇam atula-kuntala-nicayāntam

dhvāntaḿ tava jīvatu nakha-kāntibhir abhiśāntam

(3)

sā sanātana-mānasādya yāntī gata-śańkam

ańgī-kuru mañju-kuñja-vasater alam ańkam

**TRANSLATION**

Refrain: Radha, give up Your anguish. Make Your soft lotus feet peacefully walk on this path to the meeting with Krsna.

1) Why do You not stop this continual talking. The splendor of Your teeth dispels the great darkness of this talk.

2) With the splendor of Your fingernails dispel the darkness of Your cloud-black hair.    

3) Your heart is now fixed on the eternal Supreme Personality of Godhead and Your doubts and fears are gone. Now please go to the middle of this charming forest grove.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

Srila Jiva Gosvami explains that after Radharani's messenger had presented her plaint, Lord Krsna replied: "O messenger, why do you speak in this contrary way? I always think of Radha. Indeed, I remain alive only by meditating on Her." Filled with ecstatic love for Krsna, the gopi messenger returned to Radha' on the path and sang this song to Her.

This song is sung in Raga Asavari.
