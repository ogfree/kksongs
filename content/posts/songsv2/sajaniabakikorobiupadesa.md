**LYRICS:**

(Refrain)

sajani aba ki karabi upadeśa

kānu anurāge mora        tanu mana bātula

nā sahe dharama-bhara-leśa

(1)

rūpe bharata diṭhi         sońari paraśa miṭhi

pulaka nā teja-i ańga

mohana muralī\-bare       śruti paripūrita

nā śune āpana parasańga

(2)

nāsikā se ańgera      saurabha unamata

badane nānā laya āna nāma

naba naba guṇa-gaṇe      bāndhala majhu mane

dharama rahaba kon ṭhāma

(3)

gṛha-pati tarajane         guru-jana garajane

ko jāne upajaye hāsa

tahi eka manoratha       yadi haye anurata

puchata gobinda-dāsa

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) O gopi\-friend, what shall I say to you? I have fallen in love with Krsna. My body and heart are now wild to attain Him. I have not the slightest fear of breaking earthly religious principles.

1) I filled my eyes with the sight of His handsome form. As I remember the sweetness of that form, the hairs of my body do not stop standing up with joy. The enchanting sound of His flute entered my ears. Now I do not hear anything else.

2) When my nose smelled the fragrance of His body, I became wild. My mouth will not speak any name but His. My heart is bound hg the ropes of His newer and newer virtues. Where will the rules of dharma stay within me now?

3) Govinda dasa asks: When her husband rebukes and her elders roar their disapproval, only a smile sprouts within her. Who understands her smile? If she is indeed enchanted by Krsna, only one desire must stay within her now.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is sung in Raga Dhanasri.
