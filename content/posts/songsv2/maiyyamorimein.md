**LYRICS:**

(refrain)

o maiyyā morī, maiń nahiń mākhan khāyo

(1)

bhor bhayo gaiyana ke pāche

(tune) madhubana mohi paṭhāyo

cāra prahara vaḿśī vaṭa bhaṭakyo

sāñjha paḍe ghara āyo

(maiyyā, maiń kab mākhan khāyo)

(2)

maiń bālaka vahi yan ko choṭo

yeh chīko vidhī pāyo

gvāla bāla sab bair paḍe haiń

bar-bas mukha lapaṭāyo

(3)

yeh le apani lakuṭa kamarīya

bahuta hī nāca nacāyo

jiye tere kachu bheda upaj hai

jāni parāyo jāñyo

sūra dāsa tab hasī yaśodā

le ura kaṇṭha lagāyo

(naina nīra bharī āyo)

(tai nahin mākhan khāyo)

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) Oh Dearest Mother! I didn’t eat butter!

1) In the morning, by your order, I associated with the cows and grazed Madhubana fields. At four hours later, I was playing the flute and roamed and it became evening and I came home. When could I have eaten the butter?

2) I am so short, and the butter is so high, that how it is possible for Me to reach such stature? These young calf drink milk from their mother cows, and they come and lick me on my lips.

3) “Here is your stick and kambala again, and use it dance. Now that you accuse Me wrongly. I now realize a great secret, that you are not My mother. You are My foster mother.” Sura Dasa, then, sees Mother Yasoda clasping Krsna on her breast and neck and said with teary eyes, “You didn’t eat butter!”
