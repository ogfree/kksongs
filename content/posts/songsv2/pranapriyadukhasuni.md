**LYRICS:**

(1)

prāṇa-priya dukha          śuni śaśi-mukhī

pucha-i gadagada bola

amala kubalaya      nayāna yugalahi

galaye jhara jhara lora

(2)

beśa beśāyala         sabahi bichūrala

calali parihari māna

tejala kula-bhaya        nāhi gauraba

manahi jāgala kāna

(3)

pīna payodhara        jaghana gurutara

bhāre gati ati manda

ā;rati antara        pantha dūratara

bihika biracana ninda

(4)

gaḍhala manoratha          calala sundarī

bighana bipada nā māna

milala bhāminī      kuñja-dhāminī

dāsa gobinda bhāṇa

**TRANSLATION**

1) Hearing that her lover, more dear to her than life, was now unhappy, the moon-faced gopi asked about Him with broken words in a choked voice. Tears streamed from her glistening lotus eyes.

2) She dressed in fine garments, anointed her limbs with fragrances, abandoned her proud jealous anger, and went to meet Him. Fear of her kinsmen she left far behind. To her elders she gave no thought. Keeping a vigil there, Krsna stayed always in her heart.

3) Her great breasts and heavy hips forced her to walk very slowly. Her heart was filled with longings. The path way very long. She rebuked destiny for writing such things as her fate.

4) Filled with longings, the beautiful gopi walked. To dangers and obstacles she gave no thought. In the forest that beautiful passionate gopi finally met Lord Krsna. So says Govinda dasa.
