**TRANSLATION**

1) O Lord Krsna, You became attracted by the pure devotional love of the wives of certain brahmanas who lived far away from Vrndavana. O Lord, You were pleased by those trees who in that birth as trees were so much engaged in welfare activities for the benefit of others. Accompanied by the cowherd boys, You drank the nectarean water of the Yamuna river to Your full satisfaction.
