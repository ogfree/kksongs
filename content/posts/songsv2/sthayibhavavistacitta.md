**LYRICS:**

(1)

sthāyī bhābābiṣṭa citta       pāiyā bibhāba-bitta

udbhaṭa bhābete āpanāra

prāṇa-bṛtte nyasa kore        prāṇa sei nyāsa-bhore

deha prati bikṛti cālāya

(2)

baibarṇya romañca sweda       stambha kampa swara-bheda

pralayāśru e aṣṭa bikāra

sañcārī je bhābacoya          harṣāmārṣa āra bhoya

biṣāda bismoyādi tāra

(3)

prabṛtti kāraṇa hoya          līlā-kāle rase loya

āpane koraya anukhaṇa

dhūmayitā ujjwalitā           dīptā āra su-uddīptā

ei cāri abasthālakhaṇa

(4)

jāra jei adhikāra        sāttwika bikāra tāra

se lakhaṇe hoya to' udoya

mahā-bhāba daśā jathā         su-uddīptā bhāba tathā

anāyāse su-lakhitā hoya

**TRANSLATION**

1) When one's consciousness is overwhelmed with one's permanent ecstasy (sthayi-bhava), and attains the wealth of all special stimulants (vibhava), then another effect is produced of its own accord. That is, the life-air is regulated and forcibly directed within the body, thus causing various unusual transfigurations of the body.

2) The eight sattvika-vikaras are: changing of bodily colors, standing up of hairs, perspiration, shivering, choked voice, physical devastation, mental stupor, and torrents of tears. There are also 33 other transitory ecstasies known as sancari, including such emotions as jubilation, sorrow, fear, anguish, wonder, etc.

3) According to the particular mellow at play during any given lila of Radha-Krsna's eternal pastimes, then the sattvika bhava can take on four different degrees of intensity, namely 1) dhumyita (smoldering), 2) ujjvalita (ignited), 3) dipta (burning), and 4) uddipta (blazing).

4) Whoever has the adhikara or the capacity of qualification for these ecstasies experiences the awakening of the symptoms of the eight sattvika-vikaras. However, only in the mahabhava stage (as in Srimati Radharani) is it possible to observe the ornament of the uddipta blazing ecstasy.
