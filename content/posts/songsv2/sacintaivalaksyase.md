**TRANSLATION**

1) O Lord! Bestower of boons! I see You are concerned for my welfare when You contemplate the record of my past activities; even so, I have dared come before You because of your promise to purify the most fallen.  Previously, You cared nothing for me, but now is not the time to make judgments: Either renege on Your promise or purify this most fallen soul.

2) O Raghava! I am not Jatayu, the vulture king! O Krishna! I am not Sisupala, the king of Chedi! Nor, Narayan, destroyer of hell, am I the sinner Ajamila! O Ocean of Forgiveness! You should know that I am the most sinful leader of all offenders, so be on Your guard against me.

3) Chitragupta and the other scribes of Yamaraj, when trying to make a tally of my sins, write and write until the nibs of their pens break, causing them much embarrassment. O most merciful one, if You are expert enough, then save me, who am foremost amongst the fallen.

4) Within my sinful heart, I know full well at every moment that Your vow to save the fallen will never fail to bear fruit. O Lord of the Yadus, You are the spiritual master of the universe; the scriptures say I am unworthy to worship You because of my sinfulness; so if I do not chant Your name, please do not be angry with me.

5) O unlimited one! All those who have witnessed my sins are so terrorized that they stop seeing their own flaws. and they fearlessly praise each other, O Lord. So if You are truly a purifier of the fallen, then save me, the worst of all miscreants.

6) An emperor can give protection to his tributary kings as a deliverer of the fallen and I too have myself acted in this way. All these rascals in every direction think of me as a deliverer of the fallen, but if You do not deliver me, O Lord, this reputation will be the only reward I get.

7) Never once have I tasted the nectar of your feet, my life has been wasted in mundane talk. If you should capriciously discard me now and refuse me Your mercy, then Your qualities as the savoir of the fallen will be greatly damaged.

8) You are the most dutiful Lord; You have given ample evidence of Your compassion; You Yourself are completely independent, but if You are so, then am I not also? So now, if You are the deliverer of the most fallen, show it, or Your good name will everywhere be reversed.

9) If those who have been purified speak of your promise to purify the fallen, I do not do so to any great extent, even though I am the most ill-mannered of all. Whether you purify me or not, whether I speak with propriety or not, please take me only for my virtues, for who in this world is without fault?
