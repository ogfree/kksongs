**LYRICS:**

(1)

ṭhumaka ṭhumaka paga kumaka kuñja maga

capala caraṇa hari āye (ho)

(2)

mere prāṇa bhūlāvana āye

mere nayana lūbhāvana āye

(3)

aruṇa kīraṇa sama sṛna vṛnda tava

kīraṇa bala ravi āye ho

(4)

amala kamala kara muralī madhura dhara

baḿsī bajāvana āye ho

(5)

kuñja kuñja hara kuñja kuñja bhara

vṛnda rańga hari āye ho

(6)

nimikī jhimikī jhimiī nimikī jhimikī jhimī

nartana paga pīja āye ho

**TRANSLATION**

1) In slow and slow steps, the small baby steps of Hari enter the sweet land of Kunja.

2) My soul forgets and everything and goes to Kunja. My eyes are taken away by the Lord Hari and goes.

3-4) With strong light and effulgent rays coming on the land of Vrndavana, The Lotus Eyed Muralidhara Krsna comes and plays the flute!

5) Everywhere in Kunja is very very beautifully green. Vrndavana gets even more beautifully green when Lord Hari comes.

6) “Nimki Jhimki” from the Lord’s anklets vibrates beautifully as He dances.
