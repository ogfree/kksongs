**TRANSLATION**

1) His black complexion glistened. A flower-garland rested on His neck. On His feet anklets jangled. Flowers adorned His hair. Black bees flew nearby. He glanced at me with crooked eyes.

2) Whom did I see, O gopi\-friend, on the Yamuna's banks? It was the cheater Krsna, the rake Krsna. O friend, I had no power to run home. My life's breath became anxious.

3) The moon shone. The breeze made His peacock-feather in His crown move to and fro. He gently smiled. He sweetly played on His sweet flute.

4) Overcome with sweetness, He could not stand up. He leaned against a keli-kadamba tree. His sport is to cheat saintly young girls of their very life's breath.

5) Shark-shaped earrings swung on His ears. His garments were yellow. His feet were red lotus flowers. Govinda dasa worships Him.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This is to be sung in Raga Sri.
