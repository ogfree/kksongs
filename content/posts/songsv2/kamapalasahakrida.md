**TRANSLATION**

1) O Lord Krsna, On a pleasant night You performed pastimes accompanied by Lord Balarama, and surrounded by the gopis who were enthralled by Your enchanting songs.

2) O Lord Krsna, when they were frightened of the demon Sankhacuda and called out to You for help, You immediately chased after the demon. Leaving the gopis under the protection of Lord Balarama, You (followed the demon) and struck him on the head, killing him.

3) O Lord Krsna, You took the jewel from the crown of the Sankhacuda demon and presented it to Your pleased brother Balarama. O killer of the enemy of the gopis, I offer respectful obeisances unto You.
