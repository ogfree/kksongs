**LYRICS:**

(refrain)

āota mori galiyana meń giridhārī

maiń to chupa gayī lāja kī mārī

(1)

kusumala pāgā kesariyā jāmā

upara phūla hajārī

mukuṭa upara chatra virāje

kuṇḍala kī chavi nyārī

(giridhārī o giridhārī

giridharī giridharī

jaya giridharī jaya giridharī)

(2)

sundara badana kamala dala locana

bākī citavana nyārī

mora mukuṭa manohara sohe

nathanī chavi nyārī

gale motīni kī māla virāje

caraṇa kamala para vārī

(3)

rādhā pyārī araja karata hai

binatī suno banavārī

suniye kṛṣṇa murāri

mīrā dāsī daraśana pyāsī

caraṇa kamala balihārī

**TRANSLATION**

Refrain: The one coming to my village is Giridhari! I have hid myself in shyness.

1) He wears a flower filled turban and has donned a saffron colored robe. Above that are a thousand flowers. Above His crown is an umbrella, and He has an unparalleled pair of beautiful earrings.

2) He has beautiful lips and His eyes who look like the petals of a lotus. His body is filled with unparalleled love. His peacock feather in His crown is very enchanting and splendorous. He wears exceedingly beautiful rings on His fingers. On His neck is a garland of pearls. I am deeply attached to His lotus feet.

3) O beloved of Srimati Radharani, I am placing a request to You. Please heed my plea, O roamer of the forests! Please hear me, O Krsna Murari! This maidservant, Mira Bai, is thirsty for seeing You. I have fixed my mind upon Your lotus feet!
