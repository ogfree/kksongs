**TRANSLATION**

1) Embarrassed and frightened, Lord Indra, the king of the demigods offered prayers to You and touched his crown to Your lotus feet. O Lord Krsna, O knower of everything, You removed his illusion and forgave his offenses.

2) O Lord Krsna, protector of the principles of religion, O killer of the demons, You removed Lord Indra's wicked pride and forgave his offenses unto You, because You are very affectionate to those who take shelter of You.

3) O Lord Krsna, after You instructed Indra You gave him permission to return to his heavenly post. A transcendental surabhi cow glorified You, saying that You were the actual Indra (monarch). O Lord who is known as Govinda (Pleaser of the cows), I offer respectful obeisances unto You.

4) O Lord krsna, the surabhi cow bathed You with it's milk as the demigods worshipped You and the elephant Airavata bathed Lord Indra with celestial Ganges water from it's trunk.

5) O Lord Krsna, You delighted the cows, cowherd men and gopis, and granted auspiciousness to the residents of all the words. You filled king Indra joy and increased the bliss of the entire universe.
