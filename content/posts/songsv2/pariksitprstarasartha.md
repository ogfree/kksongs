**TRANSLATION**

1) O Lord Krsna, when King Pariksit asked Sukadeva Gosvami why You engaged in the Rasa-dance, the sage replied that You are full of unlimited transcendental potency and opulence, and that You manifest Your eternal pastimes, which are full of transcendental knowledge and bliss, in order to liberate the saintly devotees aspiring for liberation and to benedict those who are already liberated.

2) O Lord Krsna, You greatly glorified the gopis, and You were not at any time the reservoir of envy or ill-feelings towards the cowherd men (considering them Your rivals). You were the life-breath of the cowherd's wives, who possessed homes and children by the grace of their husbands. O Lord, please be merciful to me.
