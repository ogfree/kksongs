**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) Entering a cave of Govardhana Hill, and a pearl-necklace glistening around His neck, handsome dark Krsna walks with peerless grace, grace that eclipses even the graceful wild elephant.

1) In a jewel palace in the midst of a flowering kalpa-taru tree forest, Lord Krsna, the king of dancers who charms every heart, yearns to enjoy rasa dance pastimes.

2) Expert in many arts and pastimes, He plays languid melodies on the flute. Graceful like wild elephants, and their tight belts now loosened, the beautiful gopis run to Him.

3) He takes the hands of the beautiful gopis. Bracelets adorn His budding-twig wrists. The soles of His feet are red lotus flowers. The black bees follow Him. He is the king of springtime. Govinda dasa feels very fallen and lowly in His company.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is sung in Raga Saranaga.
