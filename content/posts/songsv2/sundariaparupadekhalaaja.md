**LYRICS:**

(Refrain)

sundarī aparūpa dekhala āja

hari abhisāra       bharama bhare sundarī

bichurala sāja bisāja

(1)

maṇi mañjīra          yatane āni dhanī

so pahiranu du-i hāta

kińkiṇī gīma        hāra bali pahirala

hāra sājā-ola mātha

(2)

ghana andhiyāra       rajanī jani kājara

garajata barikhata meha

biṣadhara bharala        dūrata patha pātara

ekāli calali teji geha

(3)

cāḍhala manorathe          dosara manamathe

patha bipatha nāhi māna

gobinda-dāsa       kaha-i braja-nāgarī

aichana bheṭali kāna

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) The beautiful gopi looked at the wonderful arrangement. Yearning to meet Krsna, she took no care that the ornaments were proper or not.

1) With both hands she carefully placed jewel anklets on her feet. She placed a necklace on her neck and an ornament on her head.

2) The night was dark like black kajjala. The clouds thundered and rained. Snakes slithered on the path. Leaving her home, she walked all alone.

3) She was filled with longing. Kama was her only companion. She did not care if she walked on the path or on the places where there was no path. Govinda dasa says: This vraja-gopi certainly met Lord Krsna.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is in Raga Kedar.
