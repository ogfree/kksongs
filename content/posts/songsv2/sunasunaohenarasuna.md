**TRANSLATION**

1) O people, please hear. Please hear. With great attention please hear of another pastime Lord Narayana enjoyed on another day.

2) From the ages of twelve years to fourteen years in His pastimes, Krsna became very handsome.

3) In His kaisora and yauvana age Krsna was dark and handsome like a splendid monsoon cloud.

4) I meditate on the handsome Supreme Personality of Godhead, who sits under a kalpa-vrksa tree in the spiritual world.

5) Above Him is a beautiful full moon.

6) He is accompanied by sixteen beautiful gopis, among whom Radha is the first.

7) On His left is Radha. On His right is Candravali. On every side are group after group of beautiful gopis.

8) Behind Radha's beloved Krsna is a great cintamani jewel palace with four gates.

9) The four gates had four gopa gatekeepers, each one charming and handsome like Lord Krsna Himself.

10) At the western gate the gatekeeper is Sridama. At the eastern gate the gatekeeper is Sudama. At the northern gate the gatekeeper is Dama.

11) At the southern gate the gatekeeper is Kinkinika. Within the gates is Vrndavana, where Krsna enjoys many blissful pastimes.

12) Millions and millions of gopa boys assist Subala and the other gatekeepers in protecting the cintamani jewel palace.

13) Decorated with various ornaments, learned in various arts, and forest garlands around their necks, these gopas look like Lord Krsna Himself.

14) Some are dark. Others are fair. All are in the prime of youth. All have limbs that are splendid and glorious.

15) Wearing gunja necklaces and peacock-feather crowns, all the gopas are charming and handsome like Lord Krsna Himself.

16) At each waist is a buffalo-horn bugle. In one hand is a flute and the other a stick. A graceful white cloth decorates each waist.

17) When Krsna is happy, all the gopas are happy. They clap their hands and sing with sweet voices.

18) They serve Krsna. Their hearts are surrendered to Krsna. Surrounding Krsna in that palace, they sing many songs.

19) His limbs anointed with sandal paste and a forest garland around His neck, Nanda's son Krsna enjoys many pastimes in that palace.

20) On His head is a peacock feather. In His hand is a charming flute. On His playful lips is a sweet smile.

21) Surrounded by the girls of Vraja, Krsna is the crest jewel of playful lovers. The gopis sing to Him sweet songs in the fifth note.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is sung in Raga Sri.
