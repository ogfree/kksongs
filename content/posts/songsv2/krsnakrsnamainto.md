**LYRICS:**

(1)

kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa maiń to pukārā

ab to karade dayā

lākhoń lākhoń janamoń janamoń

tujhako ḍhunḍhā kiyā

(2)

kaun hūń maiń kahāń se āyā kahāń haiń mujhako jānā

tere caraṇoń meń jo āyā jīvana ko pehcānā

jñāni banakara dara dara bhaṭakā mana se murata nā gayā

(3)

jīvana pathapara maiń thaka gayā hūń bhūl cukā huń bhagavan

kṛṣṇa mile jo terā sahārā tana mana karaduń arapaṇa

māyā haṭāle mādhava bacāle jalāde mana kā diyā

**TRANSLATION**

1) I call out “Krsna! Krsna!” Please be merciful to me! After a myriad of births and deaths, I have been looking for You.

2) Who am I? Where have I come from? Where is my destination? After seeing Your lotus feet, I understood and recognized the true essence of life. Being a scholar, I roamed here and there, but the image in my mind of the Deity of the Lord has not left.

3) On the road of life, I have become tired out, as I have forgotten the Lord. O Krsna, if I do meet You and receive Your support, I will offer my heart and soul to You. Please save me, O Madhava, and cast maya away and enflame the sacred fire of devotion in my mind.
