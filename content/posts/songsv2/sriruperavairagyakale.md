**LYRICS:**

(1)

śrī rūpera vairāgya-kāle, sanātana bandīśāle

viṣāda bhāvaye mane mane

(2)

rūpere karunā kari, trāna koilā gaura hari

mo adhame nā koilo smarane

(3)

mora karma doṣā phānde, hate paye gole bāndhe

rākhiyāche kārāgāre pheli

(4)

ā;pana karuna phanse, dṛḍha bāndhī mora keṣe

carana nikate leha tuli

(5)

paścāte agādha jala, dui pāṣe dāvānala,

sammukhe sāndhilo vyādha bāṇa

(6)

kātare harinī dāke, padiyā viṣama pāke

tumi nātha more kara trāna

(7)

jagāi-mādhāi hele, vāsudeve ajāmile

anāyāse karilā uddhāra

(8)

karunā ābhāsa kori, sanātana padatari

deha yena ghoṣaye saḿsāra

(9)

e-duḥkha-samudra-ghore, nistāra karaha more

tomā vinā nāhi anya jana

(10)

hena-kāle anya jane, alakṣite sanātane

patra dilā rūpera likhana

(11)

rūpera likhana peye, mane ānandita hoye

sadākare gaurāńga dheyāna

(12)

e rādhā vallabha dāsa, mane hoilo abhilāṣa

patrī paḍi karilā gopana

**TRANSLATION**

1) When Sri Rupa Gosvami renounced the world, Sanatana was in prison. Greatly distressed, he thought within his mind:

2) “Gaura Hari has mercifully delivered Sri Rupa but He has neglected this fallen one.

3) “I am bound hands and neck by the sinful reactions of my previous karma, and this has locked me in this prison.

4) “With the rope of Your mercy, please firmly tie up my hair and drag me to Your lotus feet.

5) “Behind me is a sea of unlimited depth, on both sides is fire, and before me stands a hunter with his arrow aimed.

6) “In this way a she deer is entrapped in great danger and is crying in grief, ‘O Lord, please save me from this disaster.’

7) “You effortlessly liberated Jagai and Madhai just as Vasudeva liberated Ajamila.

8) “At least with a shadow of Your mercy give me the shelter of Your lotus feet, which are like a boat. The whole world will glorify Your merciful deeds.

9) “Kindly lift me out of this deep ocean of suffering. No one else can free me from this state.”

10) After receiving a confidential letter from his brother, Rupa Gosvami, Sri Sanatana thought like this.

11) He felt pleased within his heart and began to meditate on Lord Gauranga.

12) This Radha Vallabha Dasa says, “After reading Rupa's letter Sanatana felt pleased within his heart, but he kept the letter as a secret.”
