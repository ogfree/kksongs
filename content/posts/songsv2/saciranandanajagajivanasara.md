(Refrain)

sacira nandana jaga-jivana-sara

jibane marane gora thakura amara

asiya goloka-natha         parirada-gana satha

rada-bhuja kariya prakasa

ananta acarye kaya       sange saba mahasaya

laiya kaila nilacale basa

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) Saci’s son is the life of everyone in this world. In life or death Lord Gaura is my master.

1) Accompanied by His associates, the master of Goloka, has descended to Navadvipa. He established sankirtana\-dharma, the duty for this age. He sang, danced, and taught.

2) He manifested a form glorious like gold. He wore a kaupina and outer garments glorious like the sunrise. Turning aside from any desire to stay with Visnupriya, He carried a danda and kamandalu in His hands.

3) He was Lord Krsna, the master of all the worlds. He became the guru of this world. He chanted the mantras of the holy names. Because of Him the blasphemers who committed great offenses came to worship Lord Narayana and chant His holy names.

4) He traveled to Orissa, manifested a six-armed form, and taught the chanting of the holy names. Ananta Acarya says: Surrounded by his devotees, He resided in Nilacala.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is based on Raga Sri.
