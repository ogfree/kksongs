vācya o vācaka—dui swarūp tomār

vācya—tava śrī-vigraha cid-ānandākār

**TRANSLATION**

1) O Lord, You possess two transcendental forms, properly called vacya and vacaka. The vacya is Your beautiful form full of transcendental knowledge and bliss.

2) The vacaka forms are Your holy names, such as Sri Krsna, etc. This transcendental sound form is the resting place of the bliss of all souls.

3) Your unlimited manifestations are found in these two forms. Taking pity and being very kind, they confer upon the fallen souls entrance to Your divine pastimes.

4) But I have understood Your vacaka form to be more merciful than Your vacya form, O Lord. Thus do I find Your holy name most wonderful.

5) It is the declaration of the Vedas that the holy name of the Lord and the Lord are nondifferent, yet still the holy name is more merciful than the Lord Himself.

6-7) If one is an offender to Lord Krsna but respects His holy name and calls out with all his heart and soul, “Rama!” “Krsna” “Hari” then all his offenses depart, and that person then swims without difficulty in the ocean of divine bliss and transcendental mellows.

8) A person may commit offenses to the vacya or the transcendental feature and personality of the Lord; but if he is under the shelter of the pure holy name, he crosses over all those offenses.

9) At the lotus feet of Srila Rupa Goswami, Thakura Bhaktivinoda begs for constant attachment and love for the vacaka or divine holy name of the Supreme Lord.
