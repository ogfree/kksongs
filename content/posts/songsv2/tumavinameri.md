**LYRICS:**

(refrain)

tuma vina merī kaun khabarale

govardhana giridhāri

(1)

mora mukuṭa pītāmbara sohe

kuṇḍala kī chavī nyārī

(2)

bharī sabhā meń draupadī ṭhāḍhī

rākho lāj hamārī

mīrā ke prabhu giridhara nāgara

caraṇa kamal balihārī

**TRANSLATION**

Refrain: Who but You would care for me, O lifter of Govardhana Hill?

1) Your peacock-crown, yellow pitambara, and ear-rings dazzle in a splendorous way.

2) O Lord, just as your protected Draupadi while she was being disrobed in public, please protect me in the same way. Mira Bai is an offering to the Lotus Feet of the Lord, the courtly Giridhara.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song came from the 1979 Golden Avatara released album by Lakshmi Shankar, “Lakshmi Shankar Sings Devotional Songs.” This song was rendered in Raga Kalingada in Bhajani Tala.
