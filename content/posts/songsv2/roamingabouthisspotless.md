**LYRICS:**

(1)

Roaming about, his spotless complexion shining like the autumnal moon, gait like an elephant's;

Maddened by Hari's love, formed of supreme existence, with a smiling mouth;

His eyes always rolling, a cowherd-stick in his hand, cutting through Kali;

I worship Nityananda, the infinite root of the tree of bhajan.

(2)

The abode of rasas, matchless in the company of all of his own folk;

He is known as the sole life of Vasudha and Jahnava, their husband;

Always maddened by the supreme prema, unknown to the dim-witted;

I worship Nityananda, the infinite root of the tree of bhajan.

(3)

Dear to the son of Saci, the worshipable deity of the whole world, laden with joy;

The infinitely compassionate cause of the deliverance of people immersed in Kali's age;

Declaring the message of Hari, stealing away the rising pride of the mundane ocean;

I worship Nityananda, the infinite root of the tree of bhajan.

(4)

'O brother, how much more imbued with sin will the people of Kali's age be?

Please see to a readily available means for their deliverance,

For approaching you.' In this way, he consulted the Lord.

I worship Nityananda, the infinite root of the tree of bhajan.

(5)

'Hey brother! If you so will, always chant the names: Hari, Hari;

Let this be my gift for your crossing over the ocean of samsara.'

In this way, with raised arms, he walks from house to house, shouting;

I worship Nityananda, the infinite root of the tree of bhajan.

(6)

Alas, he forcibly robs the ocean of samsara like Agastya who drank the ocean;

The rising moon, the friend of the lotus of the good fortune of the saints;

The splendor of the rising sun dissipating the darkness borne of the host of demons;

I worship Nityananda, the infinite root of the tree of bhajan.

(7)

Dancing, singing and uttering 'Hari', he roamed about roads and roads;

He roamed about selflessly, bestowing his favor on countless people;

And mercifully cast a slight glance at the saints from the corner of his eye.

I worship Nityananda, the infinite root of the tree of bhajan.

(8)

Fondly holding the most tender lotus-hand of his brother,

Together giving rise to supreme joy in hearts with the vision of their faces,

Alas! They roamed about, maddening the towns' people with their sweetness.

I worship Nityananda, the infinite root of the tree of bhajan.

(9)

The treasure of true Vaisnavas, the greatest of the rasikas who are reservoirs of rasa;

The abode of the essence of rasa, the remembrance of which delivers countless fallen souls;

Whoever recites this supreme and unprecedented Nityananda-astakam,

Within his heart Nitai's two lotus feet shall come to perpetually manifest!
