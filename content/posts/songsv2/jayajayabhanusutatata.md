**TRANSLATION**

Refrain: O Lord who danced on the shore of the Yamuna, O handsome son of Nanda, O Lord who enjoyed the pastime of the auspicious, nectarean, transcendental autumn rasa dance, all glories, all glories to You!

1) O Lord who enjoyed pastimes of playing musi in the forest beautiful with gentle moonlight, O Lord who, in order to see their ecstatic love for You, joked with the quickly arrived gopi girls,

2) O Lord who kissed the gopis, O passionate Lord, O Lord who, seeing their pride, disappeared, O Lord who stayed with virtuous Radha, O Lord who becomes controlled by the power of love,  

3) O Lord who became intoxicated by drinking the nectar of the gopis' words, O Lord who had the gopis form a great circle, O Lord who agitated the hearts of the young demigoddesses, O Lord whose necklace moved to and fro in Your transcendental pastime,

4) O Lord who delighted the gopis with water pastimes, O Lord who decorated the Yamuna's shore, O Lord full of transcendental bliss, knowledge, and opulence, O perfect Lord, O eternal Lord, O pure Lord, O dark-complexioned Lord!
