(1)

āñcare mukha-śaśī goya

jhara jhara locana roya

**TRANSLATION**

1) She hides the moon of her face behind the edge of her garment. Tears stream from her eyes.

2) Without reason she suddenly laughs. Again and again she deeply sighs.

3) Hear. Please hear, O handsome dark Krsna. These are the symptoms of love.

4) Her body burns with a fever. It is not a slight fever. Again and again she rolls on the ground.

5) She will not say a word to anyone. Who can bear to see her suffer in this way?

6) The saintly ladies confer amongst themselves: “Who will talk with this girl?"

7) Govinda dasa reassures them: By your wish this girl will certainly survive.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is sung in Raga Suhai.
