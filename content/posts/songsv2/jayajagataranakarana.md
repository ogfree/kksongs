**LYRICS:**

(Refrain)

jaya jaga-tāraṇa-kāraṇa dhāma

ānanda-kanda nityānanda nāma

(1)

ḍagamaga locana\-  kamala ḍhulāyata

sahaje athira gati   jiti matoyāra

bhā-iyā abhirāma bali ghana ghana ḍāka-i

gaura prema-bhare cala-i nā pāra

(2)

gada gada ādhamadhura bacanāmṛta

lahu lahu hāsa-bikaśita gaṇḍa

pāṣaṇḍa khaṇḍana śrī-bhuja-maṇḍana

kanaka-khacita abalambana daṇḍa

(3)

kali-yuga kālabhujańgama daḿśala

dagadhala sthābara jāńgama dekhi

prema-sudhā-rasa jaga bhari barikhala

gobinda-dāsake kāhe upekhi

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) Glory to the Lord who delivers the worlds, the Lord who is the root of all bliss, the Lord who bears the name Nityananda!

1) Tears stream from His restless lotus eyes. He is restless and unsteady. "Brother Abhirama!” He calls. Overcome with ecstatic spiritual love for Lord Gaura, He has no power to walk.

2) His half words spoken in a choked voice are sweeter than nectar. A gentle smile blossoms on His face. He breaks all sins into pieces. His glorious arms are decorated with a golden staff.

3) Seeing the moving and unmoving beings burning with poison, bitten by the fangs of the black snake that is Kali-yuga, He showers everyone with a monsoon of the nectar-antidote of ecstatic spiritual love. Only Govinda dasa does not receive that antidote. Only Govinda dasa is forgotten.
