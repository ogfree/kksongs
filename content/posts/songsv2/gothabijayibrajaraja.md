**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) Splendidly dressed by His mother, Vraja's young prince walks to the pastures.

1) Numberless cows walk before Him. Behind Him Vraja's boys cry, "Hai! Hai!"

2) Like Him in age, garments, manner, and every other way, hosts of boys surround Him. With Balarama at His left, Lord Krsna, splendid like a dark moon, walks.

3) A peacock feather splendidly rests in His crown. His jewel earrings swing to and fro.

4) His forehead is like the glistening moon. Walking on the path, how many melodies does He play on the flute at His lips?

5) A yellow cloth is gracefully wrapped about His waist. He slow walking defeats the graceful elephant.

6) His jewel anklets jangle. Govinda dasa says: Lord Krsna is the most glorious of all who are glorious.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This is sung in Raga Todi.
