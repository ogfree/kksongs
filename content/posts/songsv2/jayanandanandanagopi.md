**TRANSLATION**

1) All glories to the son of Nanda Maharaja, beloved of the gopis, the hero of Radha, Her dearmost Syama. He has appeared as the son of Saci, the monarch of Nadiya. His beautiful shape, Krsna-rupa or Sacinandana-rupa, is the abode of all beauty, and attracts all the sages and godly persons.

2) All glories to He who has adorned Himself with His beloved Radha’s kanti and manifested His Gaura-rupa, always taking pleasure in the moods of His preyasi – radha-bhava, mahabhava and madanakya-bhava. All glories to He who renders the eyes of the Vraja maidens auspicious. All glories to He who now delights the eyes of the residents of Nadiya.

3) All glories to Sridama, Sudama, Subala and Arjuna, who like fresh new rainclouds increase the ocean of prema. All glories to Ramai Pandita, Srivasa, and their other brothers who are all intimate devotees of Mahaprabhu and are dancing, chanting and rolling down on the earth in great love.

4) All glories to the powerful Balarama’s dear younger brother! All glories to Baladeva who is Nityananda Prabhu, the bestower of eternal bliss. All glories! All glories to these Two who eradicate all fear for the devotees. Govinda dasa’s hopes and aspirations rest in Their mercy.
