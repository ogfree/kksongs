**TRANSLATION**

1) Srimati Radhika’s face makes the full moon of the Sarat (Autumn) season feel bashful. Multitudes of flowers adorn her beautifully braided hair. She is dressed in a blue sari and the upper part of her body is covered with a veil. I worship the lotus feet of Srimati Radhika, the daughter of King Vrsabhanu

2) The dot of sindur on the forehead of Srimati Radhika defeats the redness of the early morning sun. The fragrance of lotus from Her body causes the bumble bees to go wild and fly around her. The gesture of her eyebrows defeats the pride of million of Cupids. I worship the lotus feet of that Srimati Radharani, the daughter of King Vrsabhanu.

3) Her eyes, which move like the khanjana bird, are anointed with mascara. From the corner of Her eyes, She shoots her beautiful glance, ust like the flower arrows from the bow of Cupid. Her beautiful nose defeats the beauty of sesame-flowers and from it a nose-ring swings very beautifully. I worship the lotus feet of that Srimati Radhika, the daughter of King Vrsabhanu.

4) Her lips are more reddish than a ripe bimba-fruit, and Her teeth are as beautifully set as the seeds of pomegrantes. Her voice is more melodious than that of a cuckoo. I worship the lotus feet of that Srimati Radhika, the daughter of King Vrsabhanu.

5) She has cheeks that are blossoming with gracefully with a golden complexion. Her jeweled ankle bells tied to Her feet sways freely. Her long hair and necklace of pears lie on Her breasts. I worship the lotus feet of that Srimati Radhika, the daughter of King Vrsabhanu.

6) The beauty of Her cheeks defeats the beauty of a golden mirror. She wears jeweled ankle bells and Her ear-rings swing beautifully. Her slender fingers are decorated with jewel-studded rings. I worship the lotus feet of that Srimati Radhika, the daughter of King Vrsabhanu.

7) She moves more majestically than the king of elephants. A golden girdle shines beautifully around her slender waist, and the small gold bells in them tinkle sweetly. Her thighs are smooth and slender like an upturned trunk of a golden banana tree. I worship the lotus feet of that Srimati Radhika, the daughter of King Vrsabhanu.

8) Her movement is more graceful than a swan’s. Jewelled ankle-bells adorn her feet. I worship the lotus-feet of that Srimati Radhika, the daughter of King Vrsabhanu.
