**LYRICS:**

(1)

yugala caraṇe prīti, parama ānanda tathi,

rati prema-maya parabandhe

kṛṣṇa nāma rādhā-nāma, upāya koro rasa dhāma,

caraṇe poḍiyā parānande

(2)

manera smaraṇa prāṇa, madhura madhura dhāma,

yugala vilāsa smṛti sāra

sādhya sādhana ei, iha boi āra nāi,

ei tattva sarva tattva sāra

(3)

jalada sundara kāńti, madhura madhura bhāti,

vaidagadhi avadhi suveśa

pīta vasana dhara, ābharaṇa maṇivara,

mayūra candrikā karu keśa

(4)

mṛgamada candana, kuńkuma vilepana,

mohana mūrati tiribhańga

navīna kusumāvalī, śrī ańge śobhaye bhāli,

madhu lobhe phire matta bhṛńga

(5)

īṣat madhura smita, vaidagadhi līlāmṛta,

lubadhalo vraja vadhu vṛnda

caraṇa kamala para, maṇimaya nūpura,

nakha maṇi yeno bāla candra

(6)

nūpura marāla dhvani, kula-vadhu marālinī

śuniyā rahite nāre ghare

hṛdaye bāḍāya rati, yeno mile pati satī,

kulera dharama gelo dūre

(7)

krsna-mukha-dwija-raje     sarala-bamsi-biraje

jara dhwani bhubana mataya

srabane patha diya     hrdaye prabesa hana

prana adi akarsi anaya 

(8)

govinda śarīra satya, tāhāra sevaka nitya,

vṛndāvana bhūmi tejomaya

tribhuvane śobhā sāra, heno sthāna nāhi āra,

yāhāra smaraṇe prema hoy

(9)

śītala kiraṇa kora, kalpataru guṇadhara

taru latā chaya ṛtu sevā

govinda ānandamaya, nikaṭe vanitā-caya

madhura vihāra ati śobhā

(10)

gobinda anandadamaya    nikate banita-caya

bihare madhura ati sobha

dunhu prema dagamagi    dunhu donha anuragi

dunhu rupa dunhu manolobha 

(11)

vrajapura vanitāra, caraṇa āśraya sāra,

koro mana ekānta koriyā

anya bola gaṇḍagola, nā śunaho uttarola,

rākho prema hṛdaya bhariyā

(12)

krsna prabhu eka-bara     karibena angikara

jena mana e satya bacana

dhanya lila brndabana     radha-krsna-sri-carana

dhanya sakhi manjirira gana 

(13)

pāpa puṇyamaya deha, sakalei anitya eha,

dhana jana saba michā dhanda

marile yāibe kothā, ihāte nā pāo vyathā,

tabu niti koro kārya manda

(14)

rājāra ye rājya pāṭa, yeno nāṭuyāra nāṭa,

dekhite dekhite kichu noy

heno māyā kore yei, parama īśvara sei,

tāre mana! sadā koro bhaya

(15)

pāpa nā koriho mana, adhama se pāpī jana,

tāre mui dūre parihari

puṇya ye sukhera dhāma, tāra nā loiho nāma,

puṇya mukti dui tyāga kori

(16)

prema bhakti sudhānidhi, tāhe ḍubo niravadhi,

āra yoto kṣāra-nidhi prāya

nirantara sukha pābe, sakala santāpa yābe,

para tattva kohinu upāya

(17)

anyera paraśa yeno, nahe kadācit heno,

ihāte hoibo sābadhāna

rādhā-kṛṣṇa nāma gāna, ei se parama dhyāna,

āra nā koriho paramāṇa

(18)

karmī jñānī michā bhakta, nā hobe tāte anurakta,

viśuddha bhajana koro mana

vraja janera yei rīta, tāhāte ḍubāo cita,

ei se parama tattva dhana

(19)

prārthanā koribo sadā, śuddha bhāve prema kathā,

nāma mantre koriyā abheda

naiṣṭhika koriyā mana, bhajo rāńgā śrī caraṇa,

pāpa granthi hobe pariccheda

(20)

rādhā kṛṣṇa sevana, ekānta koriyā mana,

caraṇa kamala boli yāo

dońhāra nāma guṇa śuni, bhakta mukhe puni puni,

parama ānanda sukha pāu

(21)

hema gaurī tanu rāi, āńkhi daraśana cāi,

rodana koribo abhilāṣa

jaladhara ḍhara ḍhara, ańga ati manohara,

rūpe bhuvana parakāśa

(22)

sakhī-gaṇa cāri pāśe, sevā kori abhilāṣe,

se sevā parama sukha dhare

ei mana tanu mora, ei rase sadā bhora,

narottama sadāi vihare

**TRANSLATION**

1) Love for the lotus feet of the Divine Couple is the resting place of transcendental bliss.  Radha and Krsna's holy names are the reservoir of transcendental sweetness.  I happily fall down to offer my respectful obeisances to Radha and Krsna's lotus feet.

2) The Divine Couple's sweet, sweet holy name is life of the mind's memory.  Their pastimes are the best remembering.  Remembering Them is both the goal and the way to attain it.  That is the truth of all truths.  This book is not the only place that it is said.

3) Sri Krsna is splendid like a monsoon cloud, very sweet and charming, expert, gracefully dressed in yellow garments, decorated with jewel ornament, and crowned with a peacock feather placed in His hair.

4) He is decorated with musk, sandal paste, kunkuma, and other fragrances.  His three-fold bending form is sweet and charming.  His transcendental body is decorated with garlands of flowers so fresh they draw swarms of maddened bumblebees eager for honey.

5) His gentle smile is sweet.  He is expert at tasting the nectar of transcendental pastimes.  He is surrounded by the amorous girls of Vraja.  His lotus feet are decorated with jewel anklets.  His toenails eclipse the glory of the crescent moon.

6) When they hear the warbling of the male swan that is Krsna's anklets, the female swan gopis can no longer remain peacefully in their homes.  Love for Him growing in their hearts, they run, leaving their household duties far behind, to meet Him, their lover.

7) The music of the straight flute placed to Krsna's lips enchants the world.  Entering first the ear and then the heart, that music attracts all living beings.

8) Devotional service to Lord Govinda is eternal.  They who serve Him are His servants eternally.  The land of Vrndavana is glorious.  There the Yamuna's water glitters eternally.  Eight forests are on the Yamuna's shore.

9) Vrndavana is splendid with cooling moonlight and glorious with kalpa-vrksa trees and kalpa-lata vines blossoming in all six seasons.  Full of transcendental bliss and glorious as the full moon, it makes everyone eager to see its blissful form.

10) Surrounded by the gopis and very handsome and charming.  Lord Govinda is full of transcendental bliss.  The Divine Couple is beautiful, charming and overcome with passionate love.

11) O mind, take shelter of the lotus feet of the Vrajagopis.  Don't listen to the useless din of the materialists' words.  Fill my heart with pure love for the Divine Couple.

12) O mind, just this one time accept Lord Krsna as your supreme master.  I tell you the truth.  Sri Sri Radha and Krsna's lotus feet are supremely glorious, Their pastimes are glorious, Their land of Vrajapura is glorious, and their friends, the sakhi-gopis and manjari-gopis are glorious.

13) This material body, which one attains because of his previous pious and impious deeds is temporary and the foolish attempt by all conditioned souls to accumulate more and more wealth is a clever trick of the illusory potency maya.  When the material body dies, what will happen to all the carefully collected wealth?  Where will it go?  O mind, don't work day and night with a great struggle simply to collect money.  You are so foolish that you constantly work for such a fleeting goal.

14) A monarch's kingdom is just like the dramatic performance of an actor:  although one sees them, they are never actually real, but only a pretence arranged by the illusory energy maya.  O mind, don't pay attention to these false material things.  Fix your mind always on the Supreme Personality of Godhead.  Fear His displeasure.  Don't be concerned with other things.

15) O mind, don't sin.  Stay far away from sinful persons.  Don't work to attain material piety, the resting place of material happiness.  Don't strive for the false liberation imagined by the impersonalists.

16) Dive into the shoreless nectar ocean of pure love for Krsna, larger than the largest salt-water ocean.  If one swims in that nectar ocean of live for Krsna, Lord Krsna will make all his sufferings disappear, and he will attain endless transcendental bliss.

17) Take great care only to serve the Divine Couple, and don't let any other activity touch you.  Know that the chanting of the holy names of Sri Sri Radha and Krsna is the supreme spiritual meditation.  Please don't try to raise any objections to this, or try to present evidence confirming any other view.

18) O mind, please engage in pure devotional service, which cannot be followed by the fruitive workers, speculative philosophers, or pseudo-devotees.  Just accept that the opinion of the exalted devotees in Vraja is the perfect explanation of the Absolute Truth.

19) I shall continually offer prayers to the Divine Couple, and I shall describe the pure love of the Lord and His devotees.  With my words I shall prove that the Supreme Lord is not different from the chanting of His holy names.  O mind, have firm faith in Lord Krsna, and worship the reddish soles of His lotus feet.  Do this, and the karmic results of your past sins will be smashed.

20) O mind, please place in my heart Sri Sri Radha Krsna's lotus feet, which are my only treasure.  Again and again hear the holy names of the Divine Couple from the mouths of the devotees, and in this way attain transcendental bliss.

21) Srimati Radharani's transcendental form has the splendour of gold.  Weeping, I pray to attain the glance of Her lotus eyes.  Sri Krsna's handsome form is splendid as a monsoon cloud.  From it the entire material cosmos is manifested.

22) I yearn to engage in devotional service with the gopis at my four sides.  That service is my great happiness.  Again and again Narottama says: This is the desire in my heart.
