**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) He is handsome and dark. His peacock-feather crown is graceful. His smile glistens like the autumn moon. Again and again He happily talks with His gopa friends, friends whose glorious garments, age, and sweetness are all like His own.

1) His graceful sweet form glistens like sapphires. His ways are charming. His garland of mallika and malati flowers makes the black bees wild with its nectar scent. He has set Kamadeva's trap.

2) A line of graceful peacock feathers kisses His curly glistening hair. His glistening restless wonderful glances rob every heart.

3) He is decorated with red gairika and yellow gorocana, anointed with sweet fragrances, and dressed in graceful garments. Govinda dasa sings the glories of Him, the Lord filled with all virtues, the protector of the cowherd people.
