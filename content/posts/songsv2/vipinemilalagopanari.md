vipine milala gopa-nārī

heri hasata muralī-dhārī

nirakhi bayāna puchata bāta

prema-sindhu gāhanī

puchata sabaka gamana kṣema

kahata kiye karaba prema

brajaka sabahu kuśala bāta

kāhe kuṭila cāhani

teji taruṇī patika kora

kaiche pā-oli kānana ora

rākhata kāḿhe manahi go-i

iha-i āna naha-i ko-i

gobinda-dāsa gayanī

**TRANSLATION**

1) The gopis assembled in the forest. Seeing Krsna play the flute, they smiled. Krsna glanced at their faces and asked them some questions. He plunged them in an ocean of love.

2) He asked of their journey through the forest was good and auspicious. He wished them well. But why did He talk to them of love? Why did He glance at them with crooked eyes?

3) "You can see this night is very fearsome. Why did you girls leave your husbands' embraces and come to the forest?" Why did Krsna speak these words?

4) "Your graceful braids have become loose. Why did you girls run here? Was there a quarrel in your homes?" As an army surrounds its oppnent, the gopis surrounded Lord Krsna.

5) "This autumn night is splendid with its moonlight. This forest grove is filled with flowers. You can see the black bees are very glorious here. Did you girls know all this before you came here?"

6) Lord Krsna spoke these words, but no gopi offered a reply. Why did they always keep Krsna in their hearts? No gopi offered a reply. Govinda dasa sings this song.

This song is in Raga Malhara.
