**TRANSLATION**

1) Sweet, sweet is the youthful Gaura. Sweet, sweet is His dancing. Sweet, sweet are all His companions. Sweet, sweet is His marketplace.

2) Sweet, sweet are the sounds of the mrdangas. Sweet, sweet is the rhythms. His devotees are wild with the sweet nectar of ecstatic spiritual love. Sweet, sweet is their singing.

3) Sweet is His leaning on a companion and sweet is His swaying to and fro. Sweet, sweet are His motions. Sweet, sweet are His beautiful words. Sweet, sweet is His effulgent glory.

4) Sweet are His lips that defeat the moon. Sweet, sweet is His laughter. Sweet is His arati, His ecstatic spiritual love, and his character. Sweet, sweet is His talking.

5) Sweet are his reddish eyes. Sweet are His sidelong glances. But Sekhar Ray has not attained His sweet loving service.
