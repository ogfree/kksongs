**LYRICS:**

I'm living in the material world

Living in the material world

Can’t say what I'm doing here

But I hope to see much clearer,

After living in the material world

I got born into the material world

Getting worn out in the material world

Use my body like a car,

Taking me both near and far

Met my friends all in the material world

Met them all there in the material world

John and Paul here in the material world

Though we started out quite poor

We got 'Richie' on a tour

Got caught up in the material world

From the Spiritual Sky, Such sweet memories have I

To the Spiritual Sky How I pray

Yes I pray that I won't get lost or go astray

As I'm fated for the material world

Get frustrated in the material world

Senses never gratified Only swelling like a tide

That could drown me in the material world

From the Spiritual Sky, Such sweet memories have I

To the Spiritual Sky How I pray

Yes I pray that I won't get lost or go astray

While I'm living in the material world

Not much 'giving' in the material world

Got a lot of work to do

Try to get a message through

And get back out of this material world

I'm living in the material world

Living in the material world

I hope to get out of this place

by the Lord Sri Krsna’s grace

My salvation from the material world
