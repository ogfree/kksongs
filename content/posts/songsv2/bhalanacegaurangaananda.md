**LYRICS:**

(Refrain)

bhala nace gauranga ananda sindhu

badana madhuri hasa caturi

nichaye sarada indu

(1)

gauranga sundara  nata purandara

prakata premera tanu

kiye naba-ghana  purata madana

sudhaya garala janu

(2)

kiba se nayana  jiniya khanjana

bhan a-bhangima sobha

aruna barana   yugala carana

e yadunandana lobha

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) Lord Gauranga gracefully dances. He is an ocean of bliss. His face is filled with sweetness. His smile is charming. He is like an autumn moon.

1) Lord Gaurangasundara is the king of dancers. Is He ecstatic spiritual love personified? Is He like a new monsoon cloud? Is He like a golden Kamadeva? Is He like nectar?

2) His restless eyes defeat the restless khanjana birds. His arched eyebrows are glorious. The soles of His feet are reddish. Yadunananda yearns to attain His association.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is to be sung in Raga Mayara.
