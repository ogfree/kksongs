**TRANSLATION**

1) O Lord Krsna, You smiled and jokingly asked the hunchbacked-girl Kubja to give the sandalwood paste (she was carrying). Because her mind was captivated by You, she nicely decorated You with that sandalwood ointment.

2)  O Lord Krsna, You became delighted when Kubja anointed all Your limbs with sandalwood paste, and You took away her triple-bent crookedness and made her into a beautiful straight girl.

3) O Lord Krsna, (attracted to You), Kubja (amorously) pulled at Your garments, causing You to smile. You reassured her and granted her a great benediction.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is based on Srimad Bhagavatam Canto 10 Chapter 42.
