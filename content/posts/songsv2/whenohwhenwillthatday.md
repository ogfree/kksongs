**LYRICS:**

(1)

When, oh when will that day be mine?

When my offenses ceasing taste for the name increasing

when in my heart will your mercy shine

when, oh when will that day be mine

(2)

Lower than a blade of grass, more tolerant than a tree.

When will my mind attain this quality?

Respectful to all, not expecting their honor,

then shall I taste the name's nectar sublime.

(3)

Great wealth or followers, feminine beauty

I won't care for them or the comforts of my body.

Birth after birth, give me, Oh Lord Caitanya

causeless devotion to Your feet divine

(4)

When will I utter Krsna, Krsna, Krsna,

with words choked up and shivering body?

When will I be trembling all over, lose bodily color,

tears pouring from my eyes,

(5)

When in Navadvipa along the Ganges bank,

shouting 'Gaura-Nityananda' as a surrendered soul,

dancing, chanting, running everywhere,

when will I become half mad of mind?

(6)

When will Lord Nityananda show mercy upon me,

when will I reject the world of Maya:

' Bestow unto me the shade of Your lotus feet

let the right to preach the name be mine.

(7)

I will beg, borrow, or steal the nectar of the name.

By the name's effect I will feel paralyzed.

Oh! Enjoyed of the nectar of the name

when will I touch your lotus feet till the end of time?

(8)

When kindness to all beings will be appearing

with free heart forget myself comforting

Bhaktivinoda in all humility prays

"Now I will set out to preach Your order sublime."
