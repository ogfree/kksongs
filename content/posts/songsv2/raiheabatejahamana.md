**LYRICS:**

(Refrain)

rā-i he aba tejaha māna

caraṇe lāgi tohe sādhaye kāna

(1)

badana na kara malina chānda

bāde ki ā-oye pūṇimaka cānda

(2)

adhara bāndhuli madhura hāsa

nīrasa nā kara dīragha niśāsa

(3)

cañcala nayana khañjana jora

bhāńga-bhujańgama rāhu āgora

(4)

ki phala mohe etahu roṣa

jagate bidita dāsaka doṣa

(5)

bacana amiya binu ye nāhi jīye

māna-kuliśa daraśāyasi kiye

(6)

gobinda-dāsa cite e-i āśa

tejana baraye māna abhilāṣa

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) O Radha, give up Your jealous anger. Walking with Your feet, go to meet Krsna.

1) Don't make Your face so dark. Make it like a glistening full-moon.

2) Don't give out these long despairing sighs. Place a sweet smile on Your bandhuli\-flower lips.

3) Your restless eyes are like khanjana birds. Now You are in a snake's grip.

4) What sweet fruit will Your jealous anger bring to You? The whole world knows that Your servant has His faults.

5) He cannot live without the nectar of Your words. Why do You show this thunderbolt of Your jealous anger?

6) In Govinda dasa's heart this desire resides: Give up this jealous anger.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is sung in Raga Sri.
