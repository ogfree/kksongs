**LYRICS:**

(1)

gorā mora gokulera śaśī

kṛṣṇera janama āji kahe hāsi hāsi

(2)

se āveśe thira haite nāre

dhari gopaveśa nāca ullāsa antare

(3)

nitāi gopera veśa dhari

hāte laiyā laguḍa nācaye bhaṅgi kari

(4)

gaurīdāsa rāmāi sundara

nāce gopa-veśe kāndhe bhāra manohara

(5)

śrivāsa advaita gopa-veśe

chāḍaya haladī dadhi manera ullāse

(6)

keha keha nānā vādya vāya

mukunda mādhava ye janama-līlā gāya

(7)

kare sumaṅgala nārīgaṇa

śrivāsa ālaya yena nandera bhavana

(8)

jaya-dhvani kari bāre bāre

dhyāya loka dhairaja dharite keu nāre

(9)

kata sādhe dekhe aṅkhi bhari'

śobhāya bhuvana bhule bhaṇe narahari

**TRANSLATION**

1) My Gora, the moon of Gokul, again and again declares that today is the birthday of Krsna.

2) In an introspective mood He has donned the dress of a cowherd boy, and dances in a way that delights His heart.

3) Nitai has also donned a cowherd dress, and dances in various ways while carrying a stick.

4) Gauridasa and Ramai look beautiful, dancing in the dress of cowherds while carrying clay pots on their shoulders.

5) Srivasa and Advaita, dressed as cowherds, joyfully throw haldi and yoghurt everywhere.

6) While different persons played different varieties of music, Mukunda das and Madhava das sang about Krishna's birth-pastimes.

7) The ladies made many auspicious sounds, as if Srivasa's home was the palace of Nanda Maharaj.

8) Again and again the devotees shouted 'jaya!', and nobody could control themselves.

9) Eagerly gazing on these pastimes, everyone felt theirs eyes to be satisfied. Narahari declares that the whole world is enchanted by that beauty.
