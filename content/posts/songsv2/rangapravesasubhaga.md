**TRANSLATION**

1) O Lord Krsna, entering the arena, You appeared to be decorated with all the splendid opulences of the heroes. You carried the great tusk on Your shoulder, and You were sprinkled with drops of blood and rut from the elephant Kuvalayapida.

2) O Lord Krsna, please be merciful to me. Your lotus-face decorated with drops of perspiration, You appeared differently to the different people in the arena, according to the different relationships they bore with You.

3) O Lord Krsna, You appeared as the greatest hero, as the most beautiful cupid, the greatest friend, the great supreme controller, the most affectionate, the supreme time-factor, and the supreme spiritual master.

4) O Lord Krsna, You appeared as the supreme truth, greatly worthy to be served, and enchanting to the minds of all living entities. Impelled by transcendental love, the people on the dais sang about Your great glories.
