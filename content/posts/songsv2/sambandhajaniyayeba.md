**LYRICS:**

(1)

“sambandha” jāniyā yebā jīvana yuddha kore

sei to’ vāńciyā thāke ār saba mare

(2)

“sambandha” nā jāni jebā āna pathe dhāya

kṛṣṇa prītii nāhi mile vṛthā janma jāy

(3)

kṛṣṇa se sambandha ādi bhālo kore bujha

se sambandha rākhi tumi māyā sāthe jujh

(4)

tāhā chāḍi hoy yebā jñāna karma vīra

mokṣa nāhi pāya tārā hoy to asthira

**TRANSLATION**

1) One who fights the war of life knowing his true relationship, He will remain alive while all others will perish.

2) One who does not know his relationship, and takes up some other path, He will never attain love of god, and his whole life is useless.

3) First understand properly your relationship with Krsna, and then keeping that relationship, go and fight with maya.

4) Other than this all the heroes of jnana and karma never attained liberation, they were all uncertain.
