(1)

kānane sabahu kusuma parakāśa

śārī śuka pika-kula madhurima bhāṣa

**TRANSLATION**

1) Flowers bloom in the forest. Parrots and cuckoos sweetly talk.

2) Peacocks and peahens loudly call. These sounds make one wild with bliss.

3) Look! Look! There is the king of playful heroes. He walks to the forest-place where He will meet His beloved.

4) He sits on a couch of twigs and leaves. He thirsts to enjoy pastimes with His beloved.

5) He watches the path. His life's breath is uneasy. The beautiful gopi has not yet come.

6) Kamadeva is manifest in His heart. Govinda dasa carefully watches the four directions.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is sung in Raga Sri.
