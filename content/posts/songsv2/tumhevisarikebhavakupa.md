**LYRICS:**

(1)  
tumhe visārike, bhava kūpa ānā,  
pāyi nānā-vidha vyathā  
tere caraṇoń meń, ā gayā hūń,  
kahūń nija duḥkha kathā

(2)  
mātrī jaṭhara meń, paḍā thā jab maiń,  
viṣama bandhana-pāśe  
eka-bāra prabhu! daraśana de mujhe,  
chaliyā dīna dāse

(3)  
taba hi ṭhārā, janama pākara,  
karuńgā bhajana terā  
janama pākara, māyā-jāla meń,  
jñāna-bhūlā saba merā

(4)  
mamatā nandana, sva-jana ke bandhana,  
moha bītāyā kāla  
janaka jananī ke sneha meń bhulā,  
prīya lāgā jañjāla

(5)  
krama se dina dina, bacapana bītā hoiyā,  
kautaka sańgi sańge  
samaya to bītā, jñāna upajiyā,  
pāṭha paḍhā rańgi rańge

(6)  
vidyā mada meń, bhrami' deśe deśe,  
vaibahava kiyā uparjana  
sva-jana pālana, kiyā data cita,  
bhulā tumhe, janārdana!

(7)  
ab hai buḍḍhāpā, bhakativinoda,  
rove kātara ati  
bhajan tujhako divasa gawāyā  
ab kyā hove gati?

**TRANSLATION**

1) I forsook You, O Lord, and came to this world of pain and sorrow. Now I submit my tale of woe at Your lotus feet.

2) While still in the unbearable fetters of my mother’s womb, I saw You before me You revealed Yourself but briefly and then abandoned this poor servant of Yours.

3) At that moment I swore to worship You after taking birth; but birth came, and with it the network of worldly illusion which robbed me of all good sense.

4) As a fondled son in the lap of relatives, I passed my time smiling and laughing. My parents’ affection helped me to forget the pangs of birth, and I thought the world was very nice.

5) Day by day I grew and soon began playing with other boys. Shortly my powers of understanding emerged. I read and studied my lessons incessantly.

6) Traveling from place to place, proud of my education, I grew wealthy and maintained my family with undivided attention. O Lord Hari, I forgot You!

7) Now in old age, Bhaktivinoda is sad. He weeps. I failed to worship You, O Lord, and instead passed my life in vain. What will be my fate now.
