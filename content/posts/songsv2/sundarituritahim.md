(Refrain)

sundari turitahiḿ karaha payāṇa

sabahu tīratha-phala          swāmī su-mańgala

bhānuka kuṇḍe sināna

aichana bacana        kahala yaba so sakhī

guru-jane anumati māgi

bahu upahāra        su-kapūra candana

le-ola bhānuka lāgi

sabahu sakhī meli          de-i hulāhuli

calatahim panthaka mājha

so bara sundarī          kari patha cāturī

milāyala nāgara-rāja

rā-ika badana         cānda heri mādhaba

pūrala saba abhilāṣa

duhu daraśane duhu       ārati naba naba

katahim gobinda-dāsa

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) "O beautiful girl, please quickly depart. You should bathe at most auspicious Bhanu-kunda, which grants the results of visiting all holy places."

1) When a friend had spoken these words, that gopi asked permission from her elders. Taking sandal paste, camphor, and many other things, She left for Bhanu-kunda.

2) When She met her gopi\-friends there was a great uproar of joyful greetings. Together, the gopis walked on the path. Walking, that wise gopi met Krsna, the king of playful heroes.

3) Gazing at Sri Radha's moonlike face, Lord Krsna felt all His desires were fulfilled. Gazing at Sri Sri Radha and Krsna, who are youthful eternally, and offering arati to Them, Govinda dasa sings this song.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is sung in Raga Dhanasri.
