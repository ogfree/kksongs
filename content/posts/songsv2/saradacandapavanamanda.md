śarada canda pabana manda

bipine bharala kusuma-gandha

phulla mallikā mālatī yūthī

matta madhukara bhoraṇī

kehu kahuka patha nā heri

aichana milala gokula-canda

gobinda-dāsa bolanī

**TRANSLATION**

1) The autumn moon glistened. A gentle breeze blew. A fragrance of flowers filled the forest. Mallika, malati, and yuthi flowers bloomed. Intoxicated black bees flew.

2) The gopis looked at the splendid night. They were enchanted by dark Krsna. They had fallen in love with Him. From a flute somewhere came melodies on the fifth note, melodies that robbed the saintly gopis of their hearts.

3) Hearing the music, the gopis were overcome with feelings of love. Entering the gopis' thoughts and there speaking eloquent words, the sweet flute-music aroused the gopis' desire to enjoy with Krsna.

4) Overcome, the gopis forgot their homes and their own bodies. To only one eye they applied black kajjala. On only one ankle they placed a jangling anklet. On only one ear they placed a swinging earring.

5) Their tight belts became loosened. Quickly the teenage gopis ran. Their belts, bodices, and garments became loose and began to slip. Their braids were tossed to and fro.

6) Somehow the gopis all met. As they walked, they could not see the path before them. They met Lord Krsna, who is like a glorious moon shining in Gokula. Thus sings Govinda dasa.
