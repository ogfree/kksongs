**LYRICS:**

(1)

āju bipine yā-ota kāna

mūrati mūrata kusuma bāṇa

janu jaladhara rucira ańga

bhańgī naṭa-bara śohanī

īṣata hasata badana-cānda

taruṇī nayana nayana phānda

bimba adhare murali khurali

tri-bhubana-mano-mohinī

(2)

kusuma milita cikura-puñja

caudike bhramara bhramarī guñja

piñcha-nicaya racita mukuṭa

cañcala nayana khañjana jora

saghane yā-ota śrabaṇa ora

aruṇa taraṇi kiraṇa gañja

gobinda-dāsa hṛdaya rañja

mañju mañjāra bolanī

**TRANSLATION**

1) Now Krsna goes to the forest. He is Kamadeva personified, Kamadeva who shoots arrows of flowers. His form is splendid like a monsoon cloud. He bends like the best of dancers. A gentle smile rests on the moon of His face. His eyes set a trap to catch the teenage gopis' eyes. He play the flute at His bimbe\-fruit lips. He enchants the hearts of the three worlds.

2) Flowers adorn His hair, flowers that attract the humming black bees on four sides. His crown is made of peacock feathers. His shark-shaped earrings swing to and fro. His glistening large eyes, eyes that reach almost to his ears, are restless like khanjana birds. The king of jewels glistens at His neck. His pearl necklace sways to and fro.

3) About His waist are a yellow cloth and a belt of jangling links. His gait is graceful and slow, like the king of elephants. His kadamba garland extends to His knees, a garland that maddens the black bees. The soles of His lotus feet are reddish like the dawn. Govinda dasa says: Graceful like a blossoming flower, Lord Krsna delights the heart.
