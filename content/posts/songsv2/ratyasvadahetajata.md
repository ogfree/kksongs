raty-āswāda hetu jata         bibhāba nāmete khyāta

**TRANSLATION**

1) All the things which cause one to taste his attachment to the Lord are called vibhava (special stimulants). The two divisions of these causes are called: 1) alambana (the persons who are foundations of support, and between whom love appears reciprocally), and 2) uddipana (the exciting factors which stimulate the awakening of love). There are also two sides to the alambana foundations 1) visayathe subject of love: Krsna) and 2) asraya (the object of love: Krsna's devotee).

2) Lord Krsna Himself is full of all good qualities, for He is the most outstanding Hero amongst all heroes. He is the eternal reservoir of all virtuous qualities, and is the Supreme Greatest of the greatest. There are many, many devotees who are very much attached to Krsna in ecstatic love. These devotees are also full of transcendental qualities themselves. Some of them are known as siddha (spiritually perfect), whereas others are sadhaka (neophyte practitioners).

3) All the things which stimulate the awakening of ecstatic emotions are called uddipana. This includes Krsna's enchanting smile, His sweet bodily fragrance, His buffalo horn, His flute, His conchshell, His place of residence, the buzzing of the bees in Vraja, the marks on the soles of His lotus feet, His ankle bells, and the soft sweet sound of His voice and flute.

4) Other causes are the association of Srimati Tulasi Devi, the various symbols and practices of devotional service, and the vision of the Lord's bona fide representatives and devotees. In this way, there are many factors to stimulate ecstatic love. And all these causes, which induce one to taste the mellow of devotion, have been clearly described by Srila Rupa Gosvami and Srila Sanatana Gosvami.
