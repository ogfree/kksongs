**LYRICS:**

(1)

śacīra ańginā mājhe, bhubana-mohana sāje

gorācānda deya hāmāguḍi

māyera ańguli dhari, kṣaṇe cale guḍi guḍi

āchāḍa khāiyā jāya paḍi

(2)

bāgha-nakha gale dole, buka bhāsi jāya lole

cāńdamukhe hāsira bijuli

dhūlā-mākha sarva gāya, sahite na pāre māya,

bukera upare loya tuli

(3)

kāńdiyā ākula tāte, nāme gorā kola hoite

puna bhūme deya gaḍāgaḍi

hāsiyā murāri bole, e nahe kolera chele

sannyāsī hoibe gaurahari

**TRANSLATION**

1) In Saci's courtyard crawls infant Gauracandra, who charms all the worlds. For a moment He grasps His mother's finger and walks. Then again He crawls and crawls. Sometimes He walks a few steps, and then again He tumbles to the ground.

2) As He crawls a splendid tiger-claw necklace swings to and fro on His chest. A lightning-flash smile glistens on the moon of His face. Now His every limb is anointed with dust. How can His mother bear it? She picks Him up.

3) He is agitated. He cries. Child Gaura scrambles from His mother's lap. She places Him on the ground. Again He crawls. Murari smiles and says: This is not just another little boy on his mother's lap. This is Lord Hari withn a fair complexion, Lord Hari who later will become a sannyasi.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This is to be sung in Raga Pahadi.
