**LYRICS:**

(1)

\`nirākār nirākār’, koriyā cītkār

keno sādhaker śānti bhāńgo, bhāi, bār bār

(2)

tumi jā’ bujhecho bhālo, tāi lo’ye koto kāl,

bhakti vinā phalodoy tarke nāhi, jāno sār

(3)

sāmānya tarkera bale, bhakti nāhi āsvādile,

janama hoilo bṛthā, nā korile suvicār

(4)

rūpāśraye kṛṣṇa bhaji’, jadi hari-preme maji,

tā’ ho’le alabhya, bhāi, ki koribe bolo ār

**TRANSLATION**

1) O brothers, by your screaming out again and again, "The Supreme Lord is formless! The Absolute Truth is a void!” why do you so insist on disturbing the peace of the Vaisnavas?

2) Having accepted this impersonal philosophy, which you consider to be very good, you are simply wasting so much time. You should understand this essential truth: Without devotion for the Supreme Lord, no factual gain is brought about by engaging in mere dry arguments.

3) Your birth as a human being is useless, for although you are supposed to be great philosophers, you did not judge rightly in this regard-by the power of mundane logic and argument you have failed to taste the bliss of pure devotion to the Supreme Lord.

4) If I worship Krsna under the shelter of Srila Rupa Goswami, and thereby deeply immerse myself in divine love for Lord Hari-and you are unable to attain that state, O brothers, then what will you do? What more will you say?
