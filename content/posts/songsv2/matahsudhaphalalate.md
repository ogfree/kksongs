**TRANSLATION**

(awakening prayer) Wake up, wake up O Supreme Personality of Godhead. Wake up half man, half lion. Wake up O You whose navel is like a lotus flower and thus make the three worlds auspicious.

1) O Mother, creeper of nectarine fruits, You are the possessor of many elevated qualities. You constantly enjoy on the chest of Nrsimha without interruption. Your body is like that of the milk ocean. You are the garland of fulfilled desires to those who fully take shelter of You. O beloved of Nrsimha, good morning.

2) Good morning to You whose greatness and opulence is unapproachable. You are the sum total of all good qualities found on this earthly plane. You are the purpose behind all achievements. O ocean of mercy, You are the beloved of the Lord of the Ghaöika mountain.

3) O Sri Nrsimha please accept our offerings, from those surrendered unto You, to Your lotus feet which are considered as weapons in the heavenly planets pouring honey. You are raised at dawn by group of sages headed by Atri.

4) You are beautifully glorified by the sapta rsis. O Lord Nrsimha, You possess lovely bodily features and wonderful qualities. You reside on the Simha-giri mountain. O Lord let Your awakening be victorious.

5) You are the destroyer of the asuras, the enemies of the saintly. You were given Sankha and Cakra by the son of Maruta. You are protected by the hoods of Lord Sesa. Your lotus feet are worshipped by the demigods headed by Lord Indra. O Lord let Your awakening be victorious.

6) O Lord, God of gods, O sweet One. You are most conversant with the purpose of mystic meditation. You are the rejuvenator of those who desire to surrender unto You. You are knower of everything, O manipulator of everything, You just like a violent storm move everything around. O Lord let Your awakening be victorious.

7) You are the protector of Prahlada Maharaja and this was the purpose of Your incarnation. You by the tips of Your beautiful nails tore apart the chest of Your enemy. Your opulence is worshipable by everyone. Your luster is like that of the shining moon. O Lord let Your awakening be victorious.

8) Those who solely hear only the sastras they always long for that holy place (Vaikuntha) that by Your mercy is always infested with brilliance and most excellent qualities and rasas that raise from bhakti. O Lord let Your awakening be victorious.

9) You are fully praise worthy being the best on battle field. You form which is the source of brilliance is described in the prayers of the learned. Protector of the pious, Your lotus feet are properly worshipped by the saintly. O Lord let Your awakening be victorious.

10) Those who desire the essence of the essence they expertly propagate Your glories by chanting about Your transcendental pastimes. This way they purify all the places just as if they would take all the holy places into their horn bugle for propagation. O Lord let Your awakening be victorious.

11) In Varanasi people worship Ganga, at Prayaga they worship Visvanatha, Lord siva, and You are famous as the Lord of the Ghaöika mountain who gives a good lesson at the right time. O Lord let Your awakening be victorious.

12) You are surrounded on both sides by Laksmi, (Bhu and Nila). Your very auspicious incarnation took place at the city of Colasimhapura. O Lord of spotless manners, at whom it is very pleasant to take shelter just like at a parijata tree. O Lord let Your awakening be victorious.

13) O best of the Ghana-desikas, Your auspicious benevolence is like an ever increasing festival of devotion. Your appearance, fully adorned in gold, is very merciful. O Lord let Your awakening be victorious.

14) By visiting the Ghanika mountain and offering obeisances to the Lord who stood on the bank of Brahma-tirtha and whose navel looks like a lotus flower, one will certainly become very intelligent, captivating and definitely a great spiritual teacher. O Lord let Your awakening be victorious.

15) Those who are most worshippable amongst great teachers and are very advanced in the process of worshipping Lord Rama always keep most auspicious paraphernalia in their hands for Your worship, they are always engaged in the service of Your lotus feet. O Lord let Your awakening be victorious.

16) Those who everyday engage the reading of this suprabhatam, which is the crest jewel of Lord Nrsimha's mountain, the pleasing faced companion of the goddess of fortune will supply all desired fruits according to their wishes and taste.
