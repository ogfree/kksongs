**LYRICS:**

(1)

mudita nayane hiyā bhuja-yuga cāpi

śūti rahala hari kachu nā ālāpi

(2)

parasańge kahalahi nāmahi tori

tabahi meliyā āńkhi cāhe mukha mori

(3)

sundari ithe nāhi kaha āna chanda

tahe anurata bhela śyāmara canda

(4)

yo-i nayana-bhańgī nā sahe anańga

so-i nayane srabe lora-tarańga

(5)

yo-i adhare sadā madhurima hāsa

so-i nīrasa bhela dīrgha niśwāsa

(6)

bidyāpati kaha micha naha bhāti

gobinda-dāsa rahu tahi kṛta sāthi

**TRANSLATION**

1) His hands folded over His heart, and His eyes closed, Krsna lies down to rest. He speaks not a word.

2) He chants Your name. His eyes glance at my face.

3) O beautiful girl, do not say anything more. Krsna glorious like a dark moon loves You.

4) From the eyes that could not resist amorous crooked glances now flow waves of tears.

5) The lips that always held the sweetness of a smile now are filled with sad long sighs.

6) What Vidyapati said was not a lie. Govinda dasa says: O gopi\-friend, please go to Him.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is to be sung in Raga Adana.
