**LYRICS:**

(Refrain)

śuna bṛṣabhānu-nandinī rā-i

abalā-maṇḍale      kirīti rākhali

bhāla mati se bithā-i

(1)

nanda-nandana         rāja-bhūṣaṇa

nayana sukha-maya śeja

ki khane tuyā sane       leha karala he

se saba dūrahi teja

(2)

ye tuhu tākara        birasa ānata

heri mūrachita bhela

kaiche pāmari       bacana aichana

nidaya antara-śela

(3)

tuhāri nāgara  dhūli-dhūsara

se nāhi lagaye toya

bāma kara\-tale  badana lambita

dharaṇī likhi lihki roya

(4)

ye jana duhu-jana  bedana nāhi jāne

tākara antara jāna

rāya rāmacandra  bacana mānaha

dāsa gobinda bhāṇa

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) O Radha, O daughter of Vrsabhanu, please listen. In the circle of young girls Your reputation was good in the past. But today that good reputation is in disarray.

1) Nanda's son is a regal jewel. Delight resides in His eyes. He loves You. Why do You flee so far from Him?

2) You have made Him very unhappy. If He sees You He is overcome. O cruel girl, why did You speak such words to Him, cruel words, words like a lance pushed into His heart?

3) For Your sake Your lover is now anointed with dust. Now He cannot attain You. In His left hand He rests His head. Aimlessly scratching some letters in the ground, He weeps.

4) No one knows what You two feel. Only You know what is truly in His heart. Please reflect on Ramacandra Raya's words. This Govinda dasa says.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is sung in Raga Dhanasri.
