**LYRICS:**

(1)

yamunā-puline, kadamba-vana meń, chavi kaun dekhi āja

śyāma baḿsīdhārī, maṇi-mañcopari, kare līlā rasarāja

(2)

kṛṣṇa-keli sudhā-prasravana

aṣṭa-dalopari, śrī rādhā śrī hari, aṣṭa-sakhī parijana

(3)

sugīta-nartana, saba sakhī-jaṇa, sevita yugala-dhane

kṛṣṇa-līlā lakhi, prakṛti-sundarī, bikharāye śobhā vane

(4)

gṛha na jāuń, vane meń praveśuń, līlā-rasa ke tare

tyāgi kula-lāja, bhajo vraja-rāja, vinoda binatī kare

**TRANSLATION**

1) Oh sakhi! My dear girlfriend! What have I seen today? In a kadamba grove on the banks of the Yamuna, a beautiful blackish boy holding a long flute (vamsi) is seated upon a throne of jewels, performing His pastimes as the King of all transcendental mellows!

2) Situated upon the eight petals of the jeweled altar is Sri Radha and Sri Hari surrounded by Their attendants the eight chief gopis. There Krsna performs His amorous pastimes which are just like a waterfall of nectar.

3) By singing sweet songs and by dancing nicely, all the gopis satisfy the treasured Divine Couple. Thus I am beholding Krsna's pastimes with His beautiful female consorts expanding throughout the splendorous forest.

4) For the sake of the mellows of such pastimes, I will not go to my home, but I will instead enter into the forest. Renouncing all shyness due to fear of family members, just worship the Lord of Vraja. This is the humble submission of Bhaktivinoda.
