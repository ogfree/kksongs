(chorus)

āju kuñje rādhā - mādhava jhulari

(jhulari jhulari jhulari jhulari)

āju kuñje rādhā - mādhava jhulari

(1)

sakhīgaṇa meli koroto gāna

ghana ghana muralī śāna

locane locana toḍai māna

nāsāya veśara lolarī

(2)

hindolā racita kusuma puñja

ali kula tāhe vihare guñja

sāri śuka pika beḍhalo kuñja

gheri gheri gheri bolari

(3)

jhulanā dhamake camake rāi,

vihasi mādhava dharai tāi

ānande avaśa paraśa pāi

cāpi dharai kolari

(4)

priya sahacari ṭānai ḍori

alase avaśa hoilā gori

ghumāolo dhani rase vibhori

dīna kṛṣṇa dāsa bolari

**TRANSLATION**

Chorus: Today Radha and Madhava are swinging in the kunja.”

1) “The sakhis meet and sing while the flute plays incessantly. Meeting eyes uproot pique and pearls dangle under Their noses.”

2) “The swing is made of lots of flowers and swarms of buzzing bees enjoy there. The female Sari-parrots, the male Suka parrots and the cuckoos fly around in the kunja, surrounding them and singing.”

3) “On the swing Radha is alarmed and scolds Madhava, Who laughs and holds Her. He becomes overwhelmed with bliss when He touches Her and keeps Her pressed on His lap.”

4) “The priya sakhis pull the ropes of the swing and Gori Rai becomes overwhelmed with fatigue. Dina Krsna dasa sings: Absorbed in rasa Dhani Rai fell asleep.”

**Remarks/ Extra Information****:**

This is to be sung in Raga Kalyana or Raga Yaman in Cancu-Puta Tala.
