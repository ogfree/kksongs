**TRANSLATION**

1) "May the young prince of Vraja, whose bodily luster defeats the pride of a monsoon cloud, the luster of Whose garment defeats that of the filaments of a lotusflower and the moon of Whose childhood becomes afflicted when he sees the sun of His adolescence rising, fulfill my desire!"

2) "May the young prince of Vraja, Who constantly stirs innumerable life-airs of His father, Who is the embodiment of His mother's great maternal love, and Who is the nectar wick for the eyes of His favorable superiors, fulfill my desire."

3) "May the young prince of Vraja, Who is the foremost and most splendid guru of all charming arts in the whole universe, Who is the most elevated resting place of valorous transcendental bliss and Who delights His innumerable friends with all His matchless attributes, fulfill my desire."

4) "May the young prince of Vraja, Who, by twanging the bow of His eyebrows, causes waves of agitation in the minds of the young girls that are hard to generate even by trillions of Cupids, and Who is the ocean in which the fish-like hearts of His dear friends play, fulfill my desire."

5) "May the young prince of Vraja, Whose goad-like eyes blissfully strike and agitate the elephant of erotic desires, thus causing it to wreak havoc in the depth of the lake of Sri Radha's heart, and Who is the bumblebee who relishes the honey of rasika loving pastimes, fulfill my desire!"

6) "May the young prince of Vraja, Whose constant love for Sri Radha defeats even the constant passionate love of the pairs of Cakravaka flamingoes (since they are separated at night, while Krsna can meet Radha day and night) and Who is the ocean wherein all the honey-rivers of sweetness stream, fulfill my desire!"

7) "May the young prince of Vraja, Whose indomitable lordly elephant-heart, which cannot be checked by anything within the three worlds, is bound by the strong and crooked ropes of Sri Radha's glance, and Whose face smiles as He hears the blissful jokes of talkative Visakha, fulfill my desire!"

8) "May the young prince of Vraja, Who by embarrasses Radha by revealing His intimate pastimes with Her, telling one girlfriend: "O sakhi! Just see how Your sakhi's waist bells shine, even though She quickly and hypocritically put them on again after suddenly meeting you in solitude at dawn!", fulfill my desire!"

9) "Sri Krsna, Who knows the flavors of Sri Vrndavanesvari Radhika's prema, will be pleased with anyone who carefully and with a satisfied heart, recites these eight verses, that describe the excellent enjoyments of the young prince of Vraja, and will count him by name amongst His own intimate associates."
