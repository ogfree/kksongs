**TRANSLATION**

1) O Krsna, desiring to take breakfast as a picnic in the forest, You called the cowherd boys by sounding Your buffalo-horn bugle, and went (to the forest) accompanied by unlimited calves and boys.

2) O Krsna, when one cowherd boy playfully stole another's lunch-bag, and when the clever cowherd boys played other games, such as the contest to see who could first touch Your lotus-feet, You became greatly pleased and jubilant.

3) O Krsna, You were always associated with Your contemporary friends, who could not for a moment even, understand Your supernatural prowess, and whose good fortune was glorified by Sukadeva Gosvami.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is based on Srimad Bhagavatam Canto 10 Chapter 12.
