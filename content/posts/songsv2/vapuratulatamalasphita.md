**TRANSLATION**

1) The best of mountains a bunch of golden flowers on the great broad arm of the branch of the incomparable tamala tree of His transcendental form, and the charming reddish fingertips of His other hand resting on His hip, Sri Gopala\-raja is splendidly manifest on the king of mountains.

2) The wonderful moon of His handsome face making the two lotuses of His charming eyes blossom, and the parrot's beak of His nose smelling the splendid bimba fruit of His lips, Sri Gopala\-raja is splendidly manifest on the king of mountains.

3) With the moving curved bows of His eyebrows shooting swift and sharp arrows from the corners of His eyes as if to drive away the powerful lion of Radha's peacefulness, Sri Gopala\-raja is splendidly manifest on the king of mountains.

4) Considering the kiss of Radha's lips unattainable and, on the pretext of vainly gazing at His own cheeks, from afar meditating on Her reflection in a mirror, Sri Gopala\-raja is splendidly manifest on the king of mountains.

5) The fragrant breeze from His teeth, which defeat a host of splendid ripe pomegranate seeds, creating the restlessness of a parrot's tongue in the hearts of the young gopis, Sri Gopala\-raja is splendidly manifest on the king of mountains.

6) Making the gopis intoxicated with the nectar of His words, and then stealing from them the precious jewels of transcendental amorous pastimes, Sri Gopala\-raja is splendidly manifest on the king of mountains.

7) As if to frighten the bumblebee gopis intoxicated by His transcendental glories, He wears on His blue lotus forehead kunkuma tilaka like a stationary lightning flash on a host of monsoon clouds. Sri Gopala\-raja is splendidly manifest on the king of mountains.

8) Eagerly tying the two Kama ropes of His ears to capture the restless young cakora birds of Radha's eyes, like a glorious moon decorated with shark-shaped earrings, Sri Gopala\-raja is splendidly manifest on the king of mountains.

9) With the powerful soldiers of His restless glances plundering the jewels of the young gopis't1, senses and keeping these jewels in the palace of His heart behind the great sapphire door of His chest, jubilant Sri Gopala\-raja is splendidly manifest on the king of mountains.

10) The three folds of skin flowing on His handsome abdomen enter the navel-lake from which a fearful serpent of a great line of hairs rises to suddenly devour the mouse of the young gopis' shyness. Sri Gopala\-raja is splendidly manifest on the king of mountains.

11) His hips broad and handsome, and His thighs a pool of sweet nectar for the gopis and the destruction of the sapphire plantain trees' pride, Sri Gopala\-raja is splendidly manifest on the king of mountains.

12) His feet lotus flowers, His calves handsome, His knees two chests for the jewels of transcendental amorous pastimes, His body decorated with many ornaments and garments, and His neck graceful, Sri Gopala\-raja is splendidly manifest on the king of mountains.

13) His transcendental form loved by the people of Sri Vitthala-desa, nourished by the sweet nectar His pure devotees' service, and eclipsing the splendor of a host of passionate Kamadevas, Sri Gopala\-raja is splendidly manifest on the king of mountains.

14) Appearing in this world, Sri Gopala\-raja, His bodily hairs erect with joy, chanted the holy names of Lord Vitthalesvara and offered Him the jewel necklace of pure love and the many flowers of the activities of pure devotional service. Sri Gopala\-raja is splendidly manifest on the king of mountains.

15) These verses are splendid with prayers to Sri Gopala\-raja, who gloriously stands on the crown of the king of mountains. These verses bring pure love to the reader. A person who with great faith makes these prayers dance on the tip of his tongue at once attains the mercy that is the jewel of pure love for Sri Gopala\-raja.
