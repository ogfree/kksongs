**LYRICS**

(1)

jei rati janme jāra      sei mata rasa tāra

rasa mukhya pañca-bidha hoya

gauṇa-sapta-rasa punaḥ        hoya ratira anuguṇa

ratira sambandha bhābāśroya

(2)

pañca mukhya madhye bhāi      madhurera guṇa gāi

sarba-śreṣṭha rasa-rāja boli

guṇa anya rase jata      madhurete āche tata

āra bahu bale hoya bali

(3)

gauṇa rasa āche jata          saba sañcārīra mata

haya srńgarera puṣṭi kore

śrī-rūpera anugata       bhajane je hoya rata

sthiti tāra kebale madhure

(4)

madhura ujjwala-rasa          sadā śṛńgārera baśa

braja-raja-nandana biṣoya

aiśwarja su-gupta ta'te       mādhurja-prabhābe mate

tāhāra āśroya bhakta-coya

**TRANSLATION**

1) According to the particular type of attachment that attracts one to love Krsna, the devotee becomes attached to that degree in one of the five direct mellows. Besides to this direct attachment, there are occasional manifestations of the seven indirect mellows, which follow the direct attachment. Thus the seven indirect attachments remain subjugated under the shelter of the ecstatic emotions presented by the more predominant direct mellow.

2) Oh brothers! Now listen as I sing of the glories of the madhura rasa, the sweet conjugal mellow, for it is said to be the best and most powerful rasa amongst all the five direct mellows. Indeed, it is just like the king of all mellows. All the transcendental qualities of the other mellows are fully present in this topmost of all rasas, and therefore it is most powerful because of the combined potencies of all the other mellows contained within it. And also, the other mellows individually become more powerful when they are within the madhura rasa than they are when they stand on their own.

3) All the seven indirect mellows give transitory stimulation to the madhura rasa (also called srngara rasa). They also circulate to nourish and supplement the ecstasies of the conjugal mellow. Those devotees who develop attachment for the worship that follows in the footsteps of Srila Rupa Gosvami become situated and firmly established only in this conjugal mellow.

4) The madhura rasa is known as the most brilliant mellow, and its main subject is Sri Krsna, the Son of the King of Vraja. Indeed, He actually lets Himself be controlled and subjugated by this loving mellow. The majestic opulences of the Lord (aisvarya) are covered over, and the powerful maddening influence of its transcendental sweetness (madhurya) is the sole refuge of all the assembled devotees, who are the object of this mellow.
