**LYRICS:**

(Refrain)

mādhaba no abicāra kula-rāmā

maramahi go-i   ro-i dina-yāminī

guṇi guṇi tuyā guṇa-gāmā

(1)

kāñcana gorī   bherī bṛndābane

khela-i sahacarī meli

tuyā diṭhi miṭhi    garale tanu jārala

taikhane śyāmarī bheli

(2)

guru-jana abudha  mugadha-mati parijana

alakhita biṣama beyādhi

ki karaba dhanī maṇi   mantra mahauṣadha

locane lāgala samādhi

(3)

kṣaṇe kṣaṇe ańga    bhańga tanu moḍa-i

kahata bharamamaya bāṇī

śyāmara nāme   camaki tanu jhāmpa-i

gobinda-dāsa kiye jāni

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) O Krsna, this saintly girl is now overcome. Her heart is wounded. Day and night she weeps. She thinks and thinks of Your host of virtues.

1) Meeting her friends there, a girl fair like gold enjoyed many pastimes in Vrndavana forest. Then the poison of Your sweet glance made her burst into flames. At once she became filled with thoughts of dark Krsna.

2) Her elders know nothing of her plight. He friends don't know what to do. Unknown to others, she is ravaged by a terrible affliction. What medicine, what mantra should we use to cure this jewel of a girl? Her eyes are now closed in a trance of samadhi.

3) Moment after moment her body is bent and crumpled. Bewildered, she speaks nonsense. Hearing the name Syama", she becomes startled and trembles. How can Govinda dasa know what to do?

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**
