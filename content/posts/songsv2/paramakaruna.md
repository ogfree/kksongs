**LYRICS**

(1)  
parama karuṇa, pahū dui jana  
nitāi gauracandra  
saba avatāra-sāra śiromaṇi  
kevala ānanda-kanda

(2)  
bhajo bhajo bhāi, caitanya nitāi  
sudṛḍha biśwāsa kori  
viṣaya chāḍiyā, se rase majiyā,  
mukhe bolo hari hari

(3)  
dekho ore bhāi, tri-bhuvane nāi,  
emona doyāla dātā  
paśu pākhī jhure, pāṣāṇa vidare,  
śuni' jāńra guṇa-gāthā

(4)

saḿsāre majiyā, rohili poriyā,  
se pade nahilo āśa  
āpana karama, bhuñjāye śamana,  
kahoye locana-dāsa

**WORD FOR WORD TRANSLATION: [Parama Karuna](http://kksongs.org/synonym/p/paramakaruna.html)**

**TRANSLATION**

1) The two Lords, Nitai-Gauracandra, are very merciful. They are the essence of all incarnations. The specific significance of these incarnations is that They introduced a process of chanting and dancing that is simply joyful.

2) My dear brother, I request that you just worship Lord Caitanya and Nityananda with firm conviction and faith. If one wants to be Krsna conscious by this process, one has to give up his engagement in sense gratification. One simply has to chant, "Hare Krsna! Hari Hari!" without any motive.

3) My dear brother, just try and examine this. Within the three worlds there is no one like Lord Caitanya or Lord Nityananda. Their merciful qualities are so great that upon hearing Them even birds and beasts cry and stones melt.

4) But Locana dasa regrets that I am entrapped by sense gratification. Since I have no attraction for the lotus feet of Lord Caitanya and Lord Nityananda, then Yamaraja, the superintendent of death, is punishing me by not allowing me to be attracted by this movement.

**Remarks/ Extra Information****:**

Sung in Raga Khamaja in Dadra Tala.
