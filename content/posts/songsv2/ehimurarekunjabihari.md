**LYRICS:**

(1)

ehi murāre kuñjabihāri

ehi praṇata tava bandho

he mādhava madhu mathana vareṇya

keśava karuṇā sindho

(2)

rāsa nikuñje guñjati niyataḿ

bhramaraśataḿ kila kānta

ehi nibhṛta patha pāntha

tvāmiha yāche daraśana dānam

he madhusūdana śānta

(3)

nava nīraja dhara śyāmala sundara

candra kusuma ruciveśa

gopigaṇa hṛdayeśa

govardhana dhara vṛndāvana cara

vaḿśīdhara parameśa

rādhā rañjana kaḿsa niṣūdana

praṇa tistāvaka caraṇe

nikhila nirāśraya śaraṇe

ehi janārdana pitāmbara dhara

kuñje manthara pavane

**TRANSLATION**

1) O killer of the demon Mura, Who roams in the gardens! Come near. O Mādhava, Who is the friend of those who bow upon, Who destroyed Madhu, Who is desirable, Who is Keśava, and Who is the ocean of compassion! Come near!

2) Hundreds of shiny bumble-bees are continuously buzzing in the gardens of \[our\] transcendental mellows. O You, Who beyond the paths of material standards, Come near. We all are craving for the sight of You, O Madhusūdana, Who is the quiet one!

3-4) O You, Who holds a new lotus, Who is dark in complexion, Who is beautiful, Who is decorated with Candrakusuma, Who rules the heart of group of Gopī, Who held Govardhana, Who roams in Vṛndāvana, Who holds a flute, Who is the supreme ruler, Who gives pleasure to Rādhā, Who destroyed Kamsa, Who is complete! I am bowing into Your feet which is the shelter of the unsheltered. O Janārdana, Who has yellow robes! Come close to me in this garden.
