**TRANSLATION**

1) Look! During the Dipavali festival Krsna's mother worships Govardhana Hill, the splendid gopis happily sing, and Krsna, His graceful hand artistically decorated with turmeric, calls the cows with a voice like thunder and makes them jump and play.

2) With the cows in front and Queen Yasoda and the gopis in the rear, the vrajajanas, headed by the Vraja King, circumambulate the hill. O friend, look! Krsna, the moon of Vraja also circumambulates, joking with His friends, and on various pretexts glancing at Sri Radha.

3) If the youthful divine couple, who are as fragrant as beautiful sumanah flowers and the life of the entire world, will not sprinkle me with the nectar of Their mercy, then, O my friend, I ask that you be merciful to me. Bless me that I may live my entire life at this sacred Radha'-kunda.

4) How many sufferings do I endure by not seeing Rupa, Sanatana, Sri Gaurangacandra, Lalita, Visakha, and Sri Sri Radha-Mukunda, whose transcendental limbs are made of the nectar pastimes of charming joking words? O forehead, I think you will break apart in this pain.  

5) As the sun with its shining makes the lotus flowers in the river blossom with splendor, Lord Krsna with the waves of many sidelong glances makes Radha' smile in the jubilant festive assembly hosted by the King of Vraja at Nandisvara.

6) Like a very thirsty cakori bird gazing at a nectar cloud in the sky, near the hill hiding Radha places Her restless eyes on the smiling circle of Lord Giridhari's face.

7) Will I assist Lord Krsna as he decorates Sri Radha whose beauty defeats Rati, Gauri, Prthvi, Laksmi, Satyabhama, Candravali, and all the beautiful women of Vrajapura?

8) Lord Giridhari, the hairs of His body erect in ecstasy, desires to paint pictures on Sri Radha' full breasts, which are more beautiful than a pair of beautiful curved waterpots. When will I be allowed to place the aromati pigments in His hand? 

9) "Who is this goddess, the vine of Her arm resting on Krsna's shoulder and the hairs of Her body upright in ecstasy as She gazes at the beauty of this forest near a hill?" "Beautiful friend, know that this girl trembling in a flood of spiritual love is Sri Radhika. Who else could it be?"

10) He was my life and soul. Again and again he kindly splashed me with the fragrant waters of shoreless ocean of limitless love. Now misfortune forces me to become swallowed by the forest fires of material calamities. I have no shelter. Except for him, of whom can I take shelter?

11) Now that I no longer have the sustainer of my life, the land of Vraja has become empty and desolate, Govardhana Hill has become like a great python, and Radha-kunda has become like the gaping mouth of a ferocious tiger.

12) It is not the fault of my body that it does not immediately fall down and die. By deep logical analysis I have concluded that the creator Brahma must have constructed my body from the strongest thunderbolts. How else could it be able to bear the weight of all this pain?

13) Chanting the glories of Sri Sri Radha'-Krsna, with love remembering Their charming lotus feet, and eating the fruit and yogurt of Vraja, may I eternally live in the forest at the base of the best of hills by the beautiful lake that belongs to the queen of Vrndavana.

14) O Lord, please allow me to pass my days living on yogurt and buttermilk under the king of hills. Permit me again and again to call out, "O Radha! O Krsna!"

Verses 10 through 14 is in reference to Srila Rupa Goswami.
