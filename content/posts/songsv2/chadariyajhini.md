**LYRICS:**

(introductory verse)

kabīrā jab ham paidā hue

jaga hańse ham roye

aisī karanī kara calo

ham hańse jaga roye

(refrain)

cadariyā jhinī re jhinī

he rāma nāma rasa bhīnī

(1)

aṣṭa kamalā ka carkhā banāyā

pāñca tattva kī pūnī

nau dasa māsa bunana ko lāge

mūrakha mailī kīnhī

(2)

jaba morī chādara bana ghara āī

rańga-reja ko dīnhī

aisā rańga rańgā rańgare ne

lālo lāla kar dīnhī

(3)

cādara oḍha śańka mat kariyo

ye do dina tumako dinhī

mūrakha loga bheda nahīń jāne

din din mailī kīnhī

(4)

dhruva prahlāda sudāmā ne oḍhī

śukadeva ne nirmala kīnhī

dāsa kabīra ne aisī oḍhī

jyuń kī tyuń dhara dīnhī

**TRANSLATION**

(Introductory verse) Poet Kabir Das says, “When I was born, the world smiled and cried. However, I will do such deeds that when I leave, I will be the one smiling and the world will be the one crying.”

(Refrain) It is a very thin transparent shawl (representing life) that is drenched in the holy name of Lord Rama, the Reservoir of Pleasure.

1) The eight lotuses is the spinning wheel using the five earthly elements to make the shawl (the body). In nine of ten days, the shawl is completed; however, the fools will destroy it.

3) When the shawl is completed, it is sent to the dyer (the spiritual master) to color it. The dyer (the spiritual master) colored it as such that it is all red (the color of self-realization).

3) Do not have doubts or fears while wearing this shawl. It is only given to you for two days and it is temporary too. The foolish people do not understand the temporariness of this shawl, and they destroy it, day after day!

4) Great devotees such as Dhruva Maharaja, Prahlad Maharaja, Sudama, and Sukadeva Goswami have worn this chadar as well as purified their shawl as well other shawls (souls). The servant, Kabir Dasa, is attempting to wear this shawl as given to him originally by his guru.
