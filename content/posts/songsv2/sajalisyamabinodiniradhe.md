(Refrain)

sājali śyāma binodinī rādhe

sańgahi rańga       tarańgi rańgiṇī

madana mohana chānde

mañju caraṇa-yuga          yābaka rañjana

bhāńa dhanuyā janu manamatha sebi

gobinda-dāsa        hṛdaye abadhārali

śińgāra deba adhidebī

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) Radha enjoys many pastimes with dark Krsna. In His company She splashes in many waves of pastimes. She enchants Him with amorous lila.

1) Her graceful feet are anointed with red yavaka. Her anklets jangle like cooing khanjana birds. Her garments are blue. Her jewel ornaments jangle. Her waist is slender like a lioness' waist.

2) Her flower-bud breasts rob the golden goblet of its splendor. Her pearl necklace glistens. Her arms defeat the unmoving lightning flashes. Her jangling jewel bracelets startle Kamadeva.

3) Her charming smile eclipses the sweetest nectar. The splendor of Her teeth defeats the splendor of pearls. Jewel earrings sway to and fro on Her graceful cheeks. Her eyes fill the ten directions with arrows of glances.

4) Her ringlets of hair are gathered into graceful braids. The archer Kamadeva skillfully bends the bows of Her eyebrows. In his heart Govinda dasa knows for certain this girl is the goddess who keeps company with Krsna, the Deity of playful amorous pastimes.
