**LYRICS:**

(Refrain)

sajani ko kahe kāma anańga

keli kadamba tale        so rati-nāyaka

pekhalu naṭa-bhara-bhańga

(1)

cūḍaka cūḍā      mayūra-śikhaṇḍaka

maṇḍita mālatī-māleee

saurabha unamata         bhramarī bheramara kata

caudike karata jhańkāre

(2)

katahu biṣama śara         nayana tūṇa bhara

sañcaru bhāńa kāmāne

nāgarī nārī         marama māhā hāna-i

lekha-i nā pāra-i āne

(3)

śruti-mūle cañcala         maṇimaya kuṇḍala

dolata makara-ākāra

gobinda-dāsa        ataye anumānala

madana-mohana abatāra

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) O gopi\-friend, was that person I saw Kamadeva Himself? A hero of playful pastimes, He gracefully danced under a kadamba tree.

1) He wore a peacock-feather crown. His jasmine garland was surrounded by black bees. Intoxicated by the scent of His garland, how many humming bees filled the four directions?

2) Moving the archer's bows of His eyebrows and emptying the two quivers of His eyes, how many flower-arrows did He fire? Many playful girls' hearts were wounded. Those girls could not gaze on anyone but Him.

3) Shark-shaped jewel earrings swung from His ears. Govinda dasa says: I think that person must have been more enchanting than Kamadeva himself.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is sung in Raga Dhanasri.
