**TRANSLATION**

1) O Krsna, decorated with autumn flowers, You appear very charming as You perform pastimes in the autumn. You appear like an actor or a dancer garlanded with karnikara flowers. I worship You.

2) O Krsna, all glories unto You. The corners of Your eyes dance in Your lotus-face, and You play very melodiously on the excellent flute placed on Your lips, which are red as the bimba fruits.

3) O Krsna, I offer respectful obeisances unto You. You cast curved glances (from the corners of Your eyes) and Your form charmingly bends in three places. The universe is enchanted by the sound of Your flute, and the gopis sing about Your glories.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is based on Srimad Bhagavatam Canto 10 Chapter 21.
