**LYRICS:**

(1)

The transcendental lamp of Navadvip, Gaurangadev,

He took with great endeavor 'round the world the souls to save

Who long had dwelt in darkness, never chanting Krsna's name

The vast renown of Srila Prabhupada I now proclaim.

(2)

The sacred treasure left by Vyas and other learned saints

He rendered into English free of speculation's taints,

And thus he mercif'lly fulfilled Sri Sarasvati's aim

The vast renown of Srila Prabhupada I now proclaim.

(3)

The brilliant sun of Lord Govinda's form is shining bright

Throughout this world because of his sharp logic's awesome might.

That sun makes all the Mayavadi glowworms hide in shame

The vast renown of Srila Prabhupada I now proclaim.

(4)

The pristine Ganges of the Bhagavat flows everywhere

Because of his great effort. In that stream, the sages' prayers

Are gems, and Krsna's pastimes are swans sporting unrestrained

The vast renown of Srila Prabhupada I now proclaim.

(5)

Ensuring that his mission's victory would be complete,

He planted Sri Sri Radha-Krsna's charming lotus feet

In temples by the dozen and in countless hearts unchained

The vast renown of Srila Prabhupada I now proclaim.

(6)

The fierce and formidable army led by wicked Kali

Is being slain by arrow showers, volley upon volley.

Those arrows are his all-auspicious books of spotless fame

The vast renown of Srila Prabhupada I now proclaim.

(7)

The Hare Krsna movement's a desire tree, whose fruits

Are all the splendid ways Lord Gaura's army wins recruits.

To plant that tree upon the earth, from Krsna's realm he came

The vast renown of Srila Prabhupada I now proclaim.

(8)

An ocean of compassion, he has taken shelter of

Sri Nanda's Son with all his being in everlasting love.

He lives on by his words, with him his followers remain

The vast renown of Srila Prabhupada I now proclaim.

(9)

I pray that those who hear this hymn, which shines the brilliant light

Of Srila Prabhupada's renown in Kali-yuga's night,

Will soon attain firm faith in his instructions so that they

May one day join him in Golok, and there with Krsna stay.
