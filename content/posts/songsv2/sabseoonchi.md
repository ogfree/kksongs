(refrain)

sabse ūńcī prema sagāī

(1)

duryodhana ko mevā tyāgo

sāga vidura ghara pāī

(2)

jūṭhe phala sabarī ke khāye

bahu vidhi prema lagāī

(3)

prema ke bas nṛpa sevā kīnhī

āp bane hari nāī

(4)

rājasuya yajña yudhiṣṭhira kīno

tāmai jūṭha uṭhāī

(5)

prema ke basa arjuna ratha hāńkhyo

bhūla gaye ṭhakurāī

(6)

aisī prīta baḍhī vṛndāvana

gopina nāca nacāī

(7)

sūra krūra is lāyaka nāhī

kaha lag karau baḍāī

**WORD FOR WORD TRANSLATION: [Sabse Umci Prema Sagai](http://kksongs.org/synonym/s/sabseoonchi.html)**

**TRANSLATION**

Refrain: Of all forms of worship of the Lord, love is the highest.

1) Lord Krsna renounced the delicacies that Duryodhana offered, and ate vegetables at Vidura’s house.

2) As Lord Ramacandra, He ate fruits which were already filled with love from Sabari.

3) Love is indeed the best way to serve and please the Lord.

4) In Maharaja Yuddhistira’s Rajasuya Yajna sacrifice, Lord Krsna served the brahmanas and picked up their eating utensils.

5) Out of pure love for Arjuna, He took the position of being his charioteer, and He forgot that He was the Lord.

6) Such love did Lord Krsna portray in Vrndavana when He danced with the gopis in the rasa lila.

7) The harsh Suradasa is not worthy to praise the merciful and magnanimous Lord.

This song became popular by Jagjit and Chitra Singh’s 1983 album “Samarpan” as well as in B.R. Chopra’s Mahabharat series.
