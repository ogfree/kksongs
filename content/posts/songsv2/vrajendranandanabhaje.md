**LYRICS:**

(1)

vrajendra-nandana, bhaje jei jana, saphala jīvana tā’ra,

tāhāra upamā, vede nāhi sīmā, tri-bhuvane nāhi āra

(2)

emana mādhava, nā bhaje mānava, kakhana mariyā jābe,

sei se adhama, prahāriyā yama, raurave kṛmite khābe

(3)

tā’ra\-para āra, pāpī nāhi chāra, saḿsāra jagat-mājhe,

kona kāle tā’ra, gati nāhi āra, michāi bhramiche kāje

(4)

śrī locana dāsa, bhakatira āśa, hari-guṇa kahi likhi,

hena rasa-sāra, mati nāhi jā’ra, tā’ra mukha nāhi dekhi

**TRANSLATION**

1) That person who worships Vrajendra-nandana makes his life successful. In the three worlds there is none equal to Him. The Vedas cannot completely describe His glories.

2) Whoever fails to worship that Sri Madhava is taken to Yamaraja after death and put in the hell called Raurava-loka (where he is eaten alive by worms and insects). There is no one as sinful as him.

3) Since there is no greater sinner than he throughout the universe, he cannot be delivered at any time but continues to wander, performing temporary materialistic activities that result in suffering.

4) Sri Locana dasa states, "Only by my desire to obtain bhakti am I able to describe Sri Hari’s qualities. I never wish to see the face of that person whose intelligence is not fixed on Vrajendra-nandana, the very essence and embodiment of all rasa.
