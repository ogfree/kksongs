**TRANSLATION**

1) Balarama and Beautiful Syama Krsna are moving along holding rods for driving the cows, ropes for binding

them, canes, and the flute from which issues sweet notes.

2) Krsna calls out, "O dear Sridama! O Sudama! Come let us play together on the bank of the daughter of Tarani (the Yamuna). As He walks, Krsna calls out for His pet cows, "Dhabali! Syamali! Come along."

3) Young is His age; charming is His beauty. His face is a veritable moon, and His complexion is like that of a dark cloud. He is decorated with a peacock feather on His head and a necklace of gunja seeds. His face appears like that of the god of love.

4) Although He is the essence or the only deity worshipped in the agamas, nigamas and Vedas, He is relishing the pastime of hearding the cows. Nasir Mehmood clings to the hope that He may give him refuge at His lotus feet.

**Remarks/ Extra Information****:**

This song is to be sung in Raga Todi.
