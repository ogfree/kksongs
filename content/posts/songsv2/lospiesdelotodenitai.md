**LYRICS:**

(1)

Los pies de loto de Nitai,

cual mil lunas nos refrescan

A todos Su sombra alivio nos dan

Sin Sus pies de loto hermano

Radha Krsna no es logrado

Con firmeza Su gracia debes tomar

(2)

Quien no aprecia Su sambhanda,

pierde su vida humana

Y se mal comporta como un animal

Quien Su nombre no exclama

busca placer en el samsara

Mas ni ciencia ni influencia lo van a salvar

(3)

Por orgullo enloquecidos

lo dejan en el olvido

Y aceptan como real lo temporal

Quien Su gracia bien reciba

tendrá en Vraja a Radha y Krsna

Así toma Sus pies sin cesar

(4)

Su refugio es real sírvelo por la eternidad

Sus pies sean tu esperanza sin fin

Estando triste Narottama

pide alegría a Nityananda

“A Tus pies deja un rincón para mí...”

**TRANSLATION**

1) The lotus feet of Lord Nityananda are a shelter where one will get the soothing moonlight not only of one, but of millions of moons. If the world wants to have real peace, it should take shelter of Lord Nityananda. Unless one takes shelter under the shade of the lotus feet of Lord Nityananda, it will be very difficult for him to approach Radha-Krsna. If one actually wants to enter into the dancing party of Radha-Krsna, he must firmly catch hold of the lotus feet of Lord Nityananda.

2) Anyone who has not established his relationship with Nityananda Prabhu is understood to have spoiled his valuable human birth. Such a human being is actually an uncontrollable animal. Because he never uttered the holy name of Nityananda, he has become merged into so-called material happiness. What can his useless education and family tradition do to help him?

3) Being maddened after false prestige and identification with the body, one is thinking, oh, what is Nityananda? What can He do for me? I don't care. The result is that he is accepting something false to be truth. If you actually want to approach the association of Radha-Krsna, you must first achieve the mercy of Lord Nityananda. When He is merciful toward you, then you will be able to approach Radha-Krsna. Therefore you should firmly grasp the lotus feet of Lord Nityananda.

4) The lotus feet of Nityananda are not illusion; they are a fact. One who engages in the transcendental loving service of Nityananda is also transcendental. Always try to catch the lotus feet of Lord Nityananda. This Narottama dasa is very unhappy, therefore I am praying to Lord Nityananda to make me happy. My dear Lord, please keep me close to Your lotus feet.
