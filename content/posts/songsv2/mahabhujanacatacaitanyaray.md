**LYRICS:**

(Refrain)

mahā-bhuja nācata caitanya rāya

ke jāne kata kata  bhaba śata śata

soṇāra baraṇa gora rāya

(1)

preme ḍhara ḍhara ańga niramala

pulaka ańkura-śobhā

āra ki kahiba aśeṣa anubhaba

hera-ite jaga-mana lobhā

(2)

śuniyā nija guṇa  nāma kīrtana

bibhora naṭana bibhańga

nadīyā-pura loka pāśarila duḥkha sukha

bhāsala prema-tarańga

(3)

ratana bitaraṇa prema-rasa barikhaṇa

akhila bhubana siñcita

caitanya dāsa gāne atula prema-dāne

muñi se ha-iluḿ bañcita

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) His arms long and graceful, Lord Caitanya Raya dances. How many hundreds and hundreds of devotional ecstasies does He feel? Who has the power to know? Lord Gaura Raya is splendid like gold.

1) He sheds tears of ecstatic spiritual love. His limbs are glorious. Splendid like sprouting blades of grass, the hairs of His body stand erect. What more shall I say? When the people of the world see Him, they understand. Their hearts yearn to attain His company.

2) Hearing the chanting of His own glories and His own holy names, He dances, overcome with ecstasy. Forgetting their pains and pleasures, the people of Nadiya float in waves of ecstatic spiritual love.

3) He freely gives away the jewels of ecstatic spiritual love. He showers a great monsoon of the nectar of ecstatic spiritual love. He showers all the worlds. Caitanya dasa sings: He gives away the peerless gift of ecstatic spiritual love. Only I did not receive that gift. Only I was cheated
