**TRANSLATION**

1) Lord, if you are sandalwood, I am water; fragranced by You in all parts of my body.

  
2) Lord, if you are a cloud, I am a peacock; looking for You like a cakora for the full moon.

3) Lord, if you are a lamp, I am the wick; with the light of love burning day and night.

4) Lord, if you are a pearl, I am the thread; just as as gold looks beautiful when adorned on a beautiful married woman.

5) Lord, you are the master and I am Your servant, Raidasa, who is always performing devotion to You.

6) There is no escape; I have already been attached to the name of chanting of Lord Rama’s name.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song was the third track from the ISKCON’s tape “Bhajan Sandhya” by Anup Jalota performed in Juhu in the early 1980s.
