**LYRICS:**

(1)

bhule bhule re doḿhāra rūpe nayana bhule

kanaka-latikā rā-i tamāla-kole

(2)

bīja-i bane bane bhrama-i duhu

duḿhāra kāndhe śobhe duḿhāra bāhu

(3)

dīpa-samīpe yena indranīla maṇi

jalada jaḍāyala yena saudaminī

(4)

kaṣite kaṣila nahe kundana hema

tulanā dibāra nāhi duḿhāra prema

(5)

badane badana dite madana jāge

ālińgana diyā śyāma kibā dhana māge

(6)

cānda upare cānda piye rasa sudhā

gobinda-dāsa kahe nā bhańgila kṣudhā

**TRANSLATION**

1) Gazing at each other's forms, Their eyes are enchanted. They are enchanted and again enchanted. Radha is like a golden vine embracing a tamala tree.

2) They wander from forest to forest. They adorn each other's shoulders with Their arms.

3) They are like a sapphire and a glistening lamp. They are like a monsoon cloud and lightning.

4) No gold is pure as Their love. Their love has no peer.

5) When They gaze at each other, amorous desires awaken within Them. When dark Krsna embraces Her, for what greater treasure can Radha ask?

6) They are like one moon sipping the nectar of another moon. Govinda dasa says: Their thirst to taste that nectar is never broken.
