**LYRICS:**

(1)

aisī bhakti dedo mujhe śyāma

ke japtā rahūń maiń terā nām

saphala ho merī bhakti

bulā le mujhako gokula dhāma

(Refrain)

nirbal ke prāṇ pukāra raheń

jagadīśa hare jagadīśa hare

(2)

ākāśa himālaya sāgara meń

pṛthvī pātāla carācara meń

yeh bol madhura jhańkāra raheń

(3)

o jab gayā dṛṣṭi ho jāti hai

jalatī kheti hari āti hai

ṭūṭe na lagā yeh tāra raheń

(4)

mujha meń tujhe meń antara yeh hai

maiń nara hūń tuma nārāyaṇa ho

maiń hūń us jaga ke hāthoń meń

jisakā tu uddhāra kareń

**TRANSLATION**

1) Please grant me such devotion to You, O Syama, the I continue chanting Your name. May my devotion to You become successful that You call me to Your abode in Gokula.

Refrain: This puny soul is calling out, O Jagadisa! O Lord of the Universe! O Hari!

2) Whether in the sky, in the Himalayas, in the oceans, in the earth, in the underworld, or hellish conditions, may I always hear the sweet sounds of “Jagadisa Hare”

3) Whenever I lose my vision and when fields of green become torched in fire, may the star of Jagadish, Hari never break away.

4) The difference between You and me, is that I am a mortal, and you are Narayana, the best of all men. I am under the hands of the world, in which you also redeem too.
