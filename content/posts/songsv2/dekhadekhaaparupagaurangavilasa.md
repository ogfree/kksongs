**LYRICS:**

(Refrain)

dekha dekha aparupa gauranga bilasa

puna giri-dharana        puraba nilakrama

nabadwipe karila prakasa

(1)

suddha-bhakti gobardhana        puja kara jagaj-jana

e-i bidhi dila kali majhe

srabanadi naba anga      kalpa-taru-maya anga

panca-rasa phale taha saje

(2)

pulaka ankura sobha        asru jana-mano-lobha

manda bayu bepathu sundara

nijendriya upacare       puja se-i giri\-bare

prema-mani pabe irta bara

(3)

dekhiya lokera gati        kali-yuga-surapati

kope tanu kampita ha-ila

adharama airabate        kumati indrani sathe

sa-sainyete sajiya a-ila

(4)

kama-megha barirane        krodha-bajra-niksepane

lokera ha-ila bada dara

lobha-moha-sila-ghate         matsaryadi khara\-bate

dhairya\-dharma ude nirantara

(5)

janiya jibera daya         sri-gauranga daya-maya

upaya cintila mane mane

bhakta-bhava saroddhara       nije kari angi-kara

bhakti-giri karila dharane

(6)

tanhara asraye loka        pasarila duhkha-soka

kali-bhaya khandila sakale

tabe kali-deba\-raja         peye parabhaba laja

stuti kare carana-kamale

(7)

aparadha ksama-iya         kahe kichu dina haiya

yata jiba prabhura asraya

yeba taba guna gaya      tahe mora nahi daya

e-i satya karinu niscaya

(8)

prabhu tahe daya kaila          dhanya kali nama haila

adhyapi\-o ghoraye samsare

caitanya-dasete bale          gobardhana-lila-chale

yuge yuge jibera uddhare

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) Look! Look at Lord Gaura's wonderful pastimes! As in the past He lifted Govardhana Hill. So again He lifted it in Navadvipa and Nilacala.

1) As the people of the world were worshiping Kali-yuga, Lord Gaura taught them to worship instead the Govardhana Hill of pure devotional service. That hill has nine parts, beginning with the part of hearing the Lord's glories. On that hill are many kalpa-taru trees whose fruits are the five rasas.

2) The grass on that hill is the devotees’ bodily hairs standing erect in ecstasy. The streams on that hill are the tears that flow from the devotees’ yearning hearts. The gentle breezes blowing by that hill are the devotees’ trembling in ecstasy. Using their own senses as the paraphernalia of worship, the people woprshiped that Govardhana Hill of devotional service. At the end they attained their desired boon, the jewels of ecstatic spiritual love.

3) Seeing what the people of the world had done, the King Indra of Kali-yuga trembled with rage. Taking with him the Airavata elephant of impiety, the Queen Indrani of wicked thoughts, and the great hosts of his armies, that Indra came to this world.

4) As the clouds of lust showered torrents of rain and the thunderbolts of anger fell, the people of the world became afraid. As hailstones of greed an illusion fell and a sharp hurricane wind of envy and other vices blew, the people's peacefulness flew away.

5) Aware of the calamity that had fallen on the people, merciful Lord Gauranga thought and thought, trying to find a solution. Deciding that to life the life of a devotee is the best solution, He lifted the Govardhana Hill of devotional service.

6) When the people took shelter under that hill, their suffering and lamentation fled far away. Their fear of Kali-yuga was broken into pieces. The embarrassed King Indra of Kali-yuga was defeated and he spoke many prayers before Lord Krsna’s lotus feet.

7) Now humbled, he asked forgiveness. He was an individual soul taking shelter of the Supreme Lord. He said, “O Lord, I praise Your glories. Please do not punish me. You are the Supreme Truth. This I know for certain."

8) Then Lord Gauranga gave mercy to him. That is why Kali-yuga is known as a fortunate and glorious time. In this world to this day Kali-yuga is famous in this way. Caitanya dasa says: Yuga after yuga, manifesting this pastime like the lifting of Govardhana Hill, the Lord delivers the fallen souls.
