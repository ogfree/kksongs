**TRANSLATION**

1) Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu is always the most worshipable Deity of the demigods, including Lord Siva and Lord Brahma, who came in the garb of ordinary men bearing love for Him. He instructs His own pure devotional service to His own devotees. Will He again become visible before the path of my eyes?

2) Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is the protector of the demigods, the supreme goal of the Upanisads, the be-all and end-all of the great sages, the beautiful shelter of His devotees, and the essence of the love of the lotus-eyed gopis. Will He again be visible before the path of my eyes?

3) Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has manifested His own form, which cannot be compared to anything in the material universe. He is very dear to Advaita Acarya, and Srivasa Pandita is surrendered to Him. He is very respectful to Paramananda Puri. He takes away the ignorance of the material world and delivers the conditioned souls suffering from the threefold misery. He showered His mercy on Maharaja Prataparudra, the king of Orissa. Will He again become visible before the path of my eyes?

4) Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu becomes maddened by tasting the mellows of devotional service. His effulgent form is the abode of sweetness for millions of Cupids, and He is the crest jewel of sannyasis. His garments display the effulgence of the sun, and the splendor of His body eclipses the beauty of gold. Will He again become visible before the path of my eyes?

5) Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu chants the Hare Krsna mantra in a loud voice, the holy name dancing on His tongue as He counts the number of recitations on a beautiful knotted string held in His effulgent hand. His eyes are large, and His long arms, bending as He performs His pastimes, reach down to His knees. Will He again become visible before the path of my eyes?

6) Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is the topmost of all devotees. Sometimes, while walking on the beach, He would see a beautiful garden nearby and mistake it for the forest of Vrndavana. He would thus be completely overwhelmed by ecstatic love of Krsna and begin to chant the holy name and dance. His tongue worked incessantly as He chanted “Krsna! Krsna!” Will He again become visible before the path of my eyes?

7) Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu danced down the main road in great ecstasy before Lord Jagannatha, the master of Nilacala, who was sitting on His car. Overwhelmed by the transcendental bliss of dancing, and surrounded by the Vaisnavas who sang the holy names, He manifested waves of ecstatic love of Godhead. Will He again become visible before the path of my eyes?

8) Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu became joyful during the loud chanting of the holy names, and he sprinkled the earth with showers of tears. All the hairs of His body, standing on end, appeared like beautiful filaments of fresh kadamba blossoms, and His body glistened with profuse perspiration. Will he again become visible before the path of my eyes?

9) May the great ocean full of waves of pure love for the two white lotus flowers of the feet of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu become immediately manifested at every moment to whatever pious person reads these eight most auspicious verses, his pure intelligence shining with faith as he meditates on Lord Gauranga.
