**LYRICS:**

(1)

sajala jalada         ańga manohara

chaṭāye cāhila nahe

īṣata hāsiyā        manera ākuti

aruṇa nayāne kahe

(2)

āju ki pekhalu        binoda nāgara

keli-kadambera tale

rūpa nirakhite      āńkhira lāja

bhāsila ānanda-jale

(3)

baula-māla diyā       kuntala ṭāniyā

ma-ura-pucchera chānde

rańginī locana      khañjana bandhite

pātila biṣama phānde

(4)

makara-kuṇḍala        sańge dolaye

gaṇḍa darapaṇa-bhāne

bhāle se madana          tāhe bimbita

gobinda-dāsa anumāne

**TRANSLATION**

1) His charming limbs dark like monsoon clouds were so effulgent I could not even look upon them. His gently smiling reddish eyes spoke of the desires hidden in His heart.

2) Who is it I saw today? He was a playful boy under a keli-kadamba tree. My eyes were shy to gaze on His handsome form. I floated in an ocean of bliss.

3) He wore a garland of bakula flowers. A peacock feather decorated His hair. His reddish eyes were like restless kanjana birds. I fell into the terrible trap He had carefully set.

4) Shark-shaped earrings swung to and fro on His glistening-mirror cheeks. Kamadeva was reflected on His forehead. Govinda dasa thinks of Him in this way.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is sung in Raga Todi.
