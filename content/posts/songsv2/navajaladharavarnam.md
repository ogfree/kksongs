**TRANSLATION**

1) Let me praise Yasoda-gopi's little son, whose complexion is the color of a new monsoon cloud, who wears splendid campaka earrings, whose face is a blossoming lotus, who smiles gently, who wears silk garments splendid as gold, who wears a peacock feather crown, and who is the best of all persons.

2) May Nanda's son, whose face defeats the autumn moon, who is an ocean of playfulness and handsomeness, who holds a toy ball in his hand, who is the life-friend of the gopis, whose transcendental form is now covered with dust, whose flute is tucked under his arm, and whose words are obeyed by the cows, protect me.

3) O Lord who killed the demon Sankhacuda, o Lord embraced by the gopis, o Lord who rises in the hearts of the devotees, o Lord who wears a peacock feather crown, O Lord who wears a charming gunja necklace, o Lord who enjoys transcendental pastimes in the beautiful forest, o Lord who wears jasmine flower earrings, O Lord Mukunda, please protect me.

4) O Lord who became angry to see the gopas troubled by the great floods and rains from the terrible clouds sent by Indra angry at the stopping of his yajna,

o Lord who lifted the great hill with your left lotus hand, o Lord who protected Vraja, o lotus-eyed Lord, please, please protect me in the same way.

5) May the Lord who, wearing a beautiful necklace of starlike pearls, appears like a god of love in the gopis' hearts, who is angry at Kamsa, the crest jewel of all demons, who delights in playing the flute, and who carries the Sarnga bow, give transcendental happiness to us.

6) May Lord Krsna's transcendental form, which is filled with wonderful pastimes, which is dark as a garland of monsoon clouds, which loves the beautiful and slender gopis, which is glorified by all the sages, which is pleased by the cows, protect me.

7) Please worship the handsome Lord, whose face removes the pride of the full moon, who is glorified as the pleasure-palace of king Nanda, who is anointed with sandal paste, who has made a mountain cave his palace to enjoy amorous pastimes with the beautiful gopis, who lifted a great mountain, and whose neck is flooded by the splendor of his earrings.

8) Please worship the Lord, who is the auspiciousness of Gokula's courtyards, who liberated Putana, who has handsome jasmine-flower teeth, whose eyes are glorified by the lotus flowers, who holds a very fragrant, blossoming lotus in his flower-blossom hand, whom even the demigods cannot approach, and who is the beloved of the gopis.

9) Let me glorify the Lord, the splendor of whose face eclipses the moon, the corners of whose cheeks are the place where jeweled shark-shaped earrings dance, who wears a garland of lotus petals, whose arms are supremely powerful, and who killed the demon Kamsa.

10) May the cowherd boy who, splashed by waves of angaraga, has now become golden, whose hand held a great mountain, who is the auspiciousness of the gopis, the blossoming creeper of whose fame shines with smiling jasmine flowers in all directions, and whose blossoming eyebrows are very graceful, now protect you.

11) O Lord who checked Indra, o prince of Vraja, o Lord who stopped the rain, o Lord who removed the floods, o Lord who protected Vraja, O Lord who pleased the cows, O Lord who lifted the hill, o Lord who stays with your friends and relatives, I glorify you.

12) O lance at the heart of king Kamsa, o Lord who always stays by the banks of the Yamuna, o Lord who wears a handsome peacock-feather crown, o root of all moving and nonmoving beings, I offer my respectful obeisances unto you.

13) May the Lord, who is splendidly anointed with sandal paste, whose transcendental form defeats the monsoon clouds, who protects the demigods, who pleases the earth, who enjoys the nectar of transcendental mellows, who enjoys transcendental pastimes, whose white teeth are very handsome, and who is the kind giver of benedictions, be kind to me.

14) Please offer your respectful obeisances to the Lord, whose flute is filled with waves of music, whose transcendental form is splendid as a new monsoon cloud, who creates great waves of amorous desire in the hearts of the young gopis, and who dances on the Yamuna's shore.

15) I worship the Lord, who is dark as a new monsoon cloud, whose ideal character pleases the entire world, who places the flute to his mouth, who wears a peacock feather crown, who holds a stick in his hand, whose eyes are handsome lotus flowers, who wears a great gunja necklace, and who stays in the forest.

16) I worship the king of the gopas, who removed the burden of the earth, who removed a host of sufferings, whose heroic prowess is sung throughout the world, who wears a great necklace of jewels, whose hair is soft and black, who is splendidly decorated with forest flowers, and who is an ocean of mercy.

17)May Devaki's son, who is the thief of the splendid gopis' garments, whose bodily luster defeats the sun, and whose powerful broad arms are gloriously decorated with sandal paste, always protect you all.

18) Please meditate on the Lord, who is the savior from the cycle of repeated birth and death, who is the herder of the surabhi cows, who holds a flute, who is expert at playing, who is decorated with pictures drawn in mineral colors, who is the enemy of the demons, and who is the lover of the gopis.

19) I eternally offer my respectful obeisances to the Lord, who holds a morsel of food, who is colored with flower pollen, who is my only shelter, whose feet are lotus flowers, who crushed Aristasura, who attracts the gopis, and who is a festival of transcendental bliss.

20) Please worship the Lord, who is a palace of transcendental pastimes, whose teeth are charming, who is amorous, whose face is the moon, whose chest is a lotus, who is splendid with fame, and who holds a lotus in his hand.

21) May the Lord, who is the death of the demons, who wears a garland of karnikara flowers, who playfully sounds the fifth note on his flute, the waves of whose pastimes flood the gopis' hearts, who is supremely independent, and who is Kamsa's enemy, protect you all.

22) May the Lord, who enjoys glorious and blissful pastimes in Vrndavana forest, who is the Kamadeva in the gopis' hearts, who speaks playful joking words, who stole the gopis' garments and then climbed a kadamba tree, and who wears a peacock feather crown, protect me.

23) O friend busily hurrying about, please develop love and devotion for Lord Hari's splendid toenails, the shelter of the surrendered devotees.

24) May Lord Hari, who wears handsome garments, who stays on the Yamuna's shore, who is the leader of the gopas, who is the abode of transcendental virtues, who is supremely pure, and who is splendid as a monsoon cloud, appear in my heart.

25) O Lord who playfully broke the yamala-arjuna trees, o Lord whose charming pastimes please everyone, o Lord whose dancing eyebrows defeat the restless khanjana birds, o conqueror of Kaliya, please protect me.

26) O Lord whose glories are proclaimed in all the worlds, o Lord who kills all the demons, o son of Yasoda, o Lord dressed in yellow garments, please grant my greatest desire.

27) O intelligent men, please at once place Lord Mukunda, who wears a graceful peacock feather in his hair, whose forehead defeats the crescent moon, and the glory of whose teeth eclipses the jasmine buds, in your heart.

28) May the Lord, who protects the surabhi cows, who expertly crushes the frightened enemies of the demigods, who again and again plays the flute, and who wears a garland of forest flowers, grant auspiciousness to you.

29) May you develop great devotion for Lord Mukunda, who pleases all the boys, whose bimba fruit lips drink the flute, who kills the demons, who is kissed by the gopis, who worships king Nanda, who is the root of all playfulness, and whose belly contains all the universes.

30) May the transcendental form named Krsna, the glorious lips of which are kissed by the young gopis, the eyes of which are restless with amorous passion, which is a monsoon of transcendental bliss, which is splendid as a new monsoon cloud, which is the most sweet thing in all the worlds, and which is gracefully garlanded, protect you all.
