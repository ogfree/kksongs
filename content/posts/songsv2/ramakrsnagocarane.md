bhāi-re!

rāma-kṛṣṇa gocāraṇe,  jaibena dūra vane,

\`āra deo’ \`āra deo’ kore

**TRANSLATION**

1) O brothers! Mother Yasoda and Mother Rohini were thinking, "Today our two boys, Balarama and Krsna, will go to a distant forest to tend Their cows." Contemplating thus in the ecstasy of parental affection, they prepared a wonderful feast for the two boys, consisting of khira, solid cream, curd, and fresh yellow butter.

2) All the cowherd boyfriends take lunch with Balarama and Krsna while dancing and singing in ecstasy. They eat the remnants of Krsna's meal until their bellies are full, and still exclaim, "Give us more! Give us more!"

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This sung is to be sung when offering to the child forms of Krsna (bāla-bhoga).
