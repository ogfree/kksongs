**TRANSLATION**

1) O Lord Krsna, all glories unto You. The gopis searched for You, asking the trees, creepers, malati flowers and tulasi plants if they had seen You.

2) O Lord Krsna, the gopis asked the deer (if they had seen You) and they observed that the entire earth planet had become festive and jubilant because it had been graced with the touch of Your lotus feet. The gopis saw that the earth was in ecstasy for this reason and it's trees and creepers were jubilantly standing upright, just as the hairs on the body of a person in ecstasy stand up.

3) O Lord Krsna, all glories unto You. Searching for You, the gopis became mad, and imagining that they had become You, imitated Your pastimes.

4) The already disturbed gopis see the search the marks of another woman’s lotus feet.
