**LYRICS:**

(Refrain)

koī kahiyo re prabhu āwan kī

āwan kī mana bhāvana kī

(1)

āp na āye, likh nahīń bheje,

bān paḍī lalacāvana kī

ye dou nainā, kahā nahīń māne

nadiyā bahe jaise sāvana kī

(2)

kā karūń kachu nahīń basa mero

pańkh nahīń uḍ jāwana ke

mīrā kahe prabhu, kaba re miloge

ceri bhayī hūń tere dāman kī

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) Oh! Someone said that Lord Hari was coming. On His coming, my mind is filled with bhava.

1) But You didn’t come. You didn’t send me a letter. I became obsessed with you. These two eyes do not want to obey the fact. These eyes are flowing tears, just like the river is flowing in rain.

2) What should I do? I have no control on my end. I don’t have wings that I could fly to You. Mira says “O Lord! Where will we meet?” My entire persona is offered unto You.
