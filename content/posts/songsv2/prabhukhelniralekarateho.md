**LYRICS:**

(refrain)

prabhu khel nirāle karate ho

(1)

kabhī kahate ho maiyā maiń halakā

kabhī kahate ho kamali bhāri hai

kabhi uńgali pe paravata dharate ho

(2)

kabhī kāliyā se nahiń ghabarāye

kabhī kaḿsa ko śera najara āye

kabhī mātā kī ḍāńṭa se ḍarate ho

**TRANSLATION**

Refrain: Oh Lord, Your divine play is very unique.

1) Sometimes, You say, “O Mother! I am shaking.” Sometimes, You say, “the butter pot is too heavy.” But sometimes, You lift a mountain (Govardhana Hill) with your small finger.

2) You were never afraid of Kaliya. You appeared as a lion in front of Kamsa. But, You are afraid of being scolded by Mother Yasoda.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is sung in Raga Darbari Kanhada in Kaherva tala.
