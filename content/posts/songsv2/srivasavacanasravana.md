**LYRICS:**

(1)

śrībāsa-bacana      śrabaṇa koriyā

sādhwī pati-brata-gaṇa

śoka parihari'      mṛta śiśu rākhi'

hari-rase dilo mana

(2)

śrībāsa takhana          ānande mātiyā

ańgane ailo punaḥ

nāce gorā\-sane      sakala pāsari'

gāya nanda-suta-guṇa

(3)

cāri daṇḍa rātre         mārilo kumāra

ańgane keho nā jāne

śrī-nāma-mańgale         tṛtīya prahara

rajanī atīta gāne

(4)

kīrtana bhańgile         kohe gaura-hari

āji keno pāi duḥkha

bujhi ei gṛhe       kichu amańgala

ghaṭiyā harilo sukha

(5)

tabe bhakta-jana         nibedana kore

śrībāsa-śiśura kathā

śuni' gorā rāya          bole hāya hāya

marame pāinu byathā

(6)

keno nā kohile      āmāre takhana

bipada-sambada sabe

bhakatibinoda       bhakata-batsala

snehete mājilo tabe

**TRANSLATION**

1) Hearing these words of Srivasa Pandita, all those chaste and faithful ladies gave up their lamentation for the dead son, because Srivasa had satisfied their minds by informing them of the transcendental mellows of Lord Hari.

2) Then Srivasa again came out into the courtyard and, overwhelmed with joy, resumed dancing with Lord Caitanya and loudly sang the glories of the Son of Nanda Maharaja, completely forgetting about what had just happened.

3) The boy had expired only 1 – ½ hours after dark, but out in the courtyard no one had known anything due to the loud kirtana. Then for 9 hours there was continuous chanting of the auspicious holy names. Thus the entire night had elapsed in this ecstatic singing.

4) Then the kirtana stopped, and Lord Gaurahari said, "Why am I feeling some unhappiness today? I can understand that something inauspicious has happened in this house which has robbed Me of My bliss."

5) Then the devotees related to the Lord the story of the death of Srivasa's son. Hearing this news, the Lord loudly exclaimed, "Oh no! What has happened? Now the core of My heart has become pierced with so much unbearable pain!"

6) "Why didn't you inform Me of this calamity when it had just happened?" Now, Bhaktivinoda has completely lost himself in the affection that he Lords shows to His own devotees.
