**LYRICS:**

(Refrain)

e dhani māninī māna nivāro!

ābire aruṇa, śyāma ańga mukure,

nija pratibimba nehāro

(1)

tuhu eke ramaṇī, rasavatī śiromaṇi

kon aiche jaga māho

tohāri samukhe śyāma, ān sańge vilasabo

koichana rasa niravāho

(2)

aichana sahacari, vacana śravaṇe dhari,

sarama bharama mukha pheri

īṣata hāsi mone, māna teyāgalo,

ulasita dońhe dońhā heri

(3)

puna saba jana meli, koroye vinoda keli,

picakāri lei nija hāte

dvija haridāsa, ābira jogāyato,

sakala sakhīgaṇa sāthe

**TRANSLATION**

Refrain: O Fortunate, angry girl! Give up Your pique! You are seeing Your own reflection within Syama's mirror-like body, which is reddened by abira!

1) Which woman in the world is the crown jewel of rasikas like You? How could Syama ever sport rasika pastimes with another girl in front of You?

2) Hearing such words of Her sakhis Sri Radhika understood Her mistake and turned Her face around. Slightly smiling, She then gave up Her pique. Thus They gladly looked at Each other again.

3) Again everyone assembled to perform joyful pastimes, taking syringes in the hand. Dvija Haridasa supplies them the abira along with all the other sakhis.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is sung in Raga Sohini in Ektala.
