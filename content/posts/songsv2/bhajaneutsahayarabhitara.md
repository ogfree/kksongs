**LYRICS:**

(1)

bhajane utsaha yara bhitare bahire

sudurllabha krsna-bhakti pabe dhire dhire

(2)

krsna-bhakti prati yara visvasa niscaya

sraddhavan bhaktiman jana sei haya

(3)

krsna-seva na paiya dhira-bhave yei

bhaktira sadhana kare bhaktiman sei

(4)

yahate krsnera seva krsnera santosa

sei karme vrati sada na karaye rosa

(5)

krsnera abhakta-jana-sanga parihari'

bhaktiman bhakta-sange sada bhaje hari

(6)

krsna-bhakta yaha kare tad anusarane

bhaktiman acaraya jivane marane

(7)

ei chaya jana haya bhakti adhikari

visvera-mangala kare bhakti paracari

3) And if Sri Krsna's service he fails to attain, yet practices with (3) patience - devout is such a man.

4) That which serves Lord Krsna, for only Krsna's pleasure, in such action, the devotee can never feel anger.

5) Abandoning the company of the non-devotee, ever with devotees, the devout serve Sri Hari.

6) Following the pure devotees' direction on the path, the true devout practice, as a matter of life and death.

7) Who follow these six qualities qualify for pure devotion -they purify the universe by their preaching mission."
