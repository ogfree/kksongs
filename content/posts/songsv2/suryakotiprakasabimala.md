**TRANSLATION**

1) The Lord's dark form is splendid like millions of suns. His face is splendid like moons and lotus flowers.

2) On His head He wears a beautiful many-jeweled crown and on His ears He wears beautiful shark-shaped earrings.

3) The glory of His face is like moonlight. His gentle smile is like foam on the ocean of milk.

4) His arms are like lotus stems and His hands like lotus flowers. His bracelets and other ornaments are very charming.

5) Dressed in yellow garments and decorated with a string of pearls, He is like a dark raincloud accompanied by lighting and a line of white birds.

6) He carries a conch, cakra, clubs, and lotus in His four hands. His charming navel is Brahma's birthplace.

7) Wearing exquisite yellow garments and a graceful belt, he is very charming and handsome.

8) His lotus toenails are like a series of jewels on the crowns worn by Brahma and the demigods.

9) On His left is Laksmi-devi, splendid like a golden campaka flower. On His right is Prthivi-devi, splendid like a blade of durva grass.

10) Rapt in meditation, Sanaka and the sages stay behind Him. Reciting many prayers, with folded palms Garuda stands before Him.

11) Many liberated associates gaze at the four-armed Lord's very glorious feet.

12) If I think of this form of the Lord I become rapt in meditation. In my heart I see only the Lord's limbs and nothing else.
