**TRANSLATION**

1) O Krsna, while sitting on mother Yasoda's lap You greatly amazed her by performing the pastimes of becoming very heavy. (After she had put You down), You were carried away by the demon Trnavarta.

2) O Krsna, Your mother searched for You, and the demon Trnavarta became unable to carry You. Grasping the demons throat, You caused him to fall to the ground, lifeless and inactive.

3) O Krsna, in this way You made the Trnavarta demon become as harmless and insignificant as a blade of grass. The crying gopis saw You and You were given to Your mother, the gopi Yasoda, who began to nurse You. O Lord, O Giver of bliss to the inhabitants of Vraja, I offer respectful obeisances unto You.
