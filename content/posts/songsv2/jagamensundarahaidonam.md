**LYRICS:**

(refrain)

jaga meń sundara hai do nāma

cāhe kṛṣṇa kaho yā rāma

bolo rāma rāma rāma

bolo śyāma śyāma śyāma

(1)

mākhana brija meń ek curāve

ek peḍ ḍhilanī ke khāve

prema bhāva se bhare anokhe

dono ke hai kām

(2)

ek hṛday meń prema baḍhāve

ek tāpa santāpa miṭāve

dono sukha ke sāgara hai

aur dono pūraṇa kāma

(3)

ek kaḿsa pāpi ko māre

ek duṣṭa rāvaṇa sańghāre

dono dīna ke duḥkha harata hai

dono bal ke dhām

(4)

ek rādhikā ke sańgarāje

ek jānakī sańgavirāje

cahe sītā rāma kaho

ya bolo rādhe śyām

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain): In the world, there are only two beautiful names, whether you chant Krsna or Rama. Sing the names of Rama and Krsna!

1) As Krsna, He stole butter from butter from Vraja. As Rama, He ate fruits and roots from trees. Both are won with prema and bhava, since they are Love personified.

2) As Krsna, He poured love into the hearts of the gopis. As Rama, He destroyed the evil demons during His forest exile. Both of the ocean of happiness, and both are complete Cupids.

3) As Krsna, He killed the sinner Kamsa, and as Rama, He killed the rascal Ravana. Both names destroy distress of the fallen. They both are strength, personified.

4) As Krsna, He is eternally with Sri Radhika. As Rama, He is eternally with Sita-devi. They are the same Supreme Lord, whether you chant Sita-Rama or Radhe-Syam.
