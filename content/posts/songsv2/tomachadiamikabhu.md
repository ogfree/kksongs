**LYRICS:**

(1)

hari he

tomā chāḍi' āmi kabhu      anātha nā hoi prabhu

prabhu-hīna dāsa nirāśroya

āmāke nā nile sātha      kaiche tumi ha'be nātha

domanīya ke tomāra hoya

(2)

āmādera e sambandha      bidhi-kṛta su-nirbandha

sa-bidhi tomāra guṇa-dhāma

ata eba nibedana         śuno he madhu-mathana

chāḍā-chāḍi nāhe kona kāma

(3)

e bhaktibinoda gāya      rākho more taba pāya

pālo more nā chāḍo kakhana

jabe mama pāo doṣa       koriyā ucita roṣa

daṇḍa diyā deo śrī-caraṇa

**TRANSLATION**

1) My dear Hari! I will never, ever abandon Your shelter, oh Lord, for if I were to do that, I would become utterly helpless without my Master. When a faithful servant becomes bereft of his Master, then he remains helplessly lost and confused, with no shelter from any quarter. However, if You do not accept me into Your association, then how will You be known as my Master, and who else besides me will be a suitable recipient of Your mercy?

2) This is our eternal relationship which is unavoidably fixed up by our destiny, and which reflects Your abode of good qualities. Please hear my appeal to You now, oh Lord Who bestows nectar upon those that You punish! For there is no possibility whatsoever of separating us from our eternal relationship of being the Master (You) and the servant (me).

3) Now Bhaktivinoda sings to You his appeal, dear Lord: Please keep me always under the shelter of Your lotus feet, always protect me, and never abandon me at any time. Whenever You find me deviating slightly from the shelter of Your feet, then I request You to please manifest suitable anger and punish me in a befitting way by mercifully kicking some sense into me with those same divine lotus feet.
