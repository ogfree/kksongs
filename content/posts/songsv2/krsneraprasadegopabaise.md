**TRANSLATION**

1) By Lord Krsna's mercy, the gopa people in Vrndavana did not know anything of disease, lamentation, or fear.

2) At every moment Govinda protected everyone. All the sins of every past birth were thrown far away.

3) When He attained the age of twelve years, Krsna became very handsome. He enchanted all the worlds.

4) His lotus face defeated the full moon. His charming eyes defeated the khanjana birds.

5) He wore a peacock feather atop His curly hair. He wore earrings of rubies and diamonds.

6) On His chest was a flower garland of many colors. On His hands were golden rings and bracelets.

7) On His feet were anklets and on His graceful head a crown. Accompanied by many boys, He who is the master of the universes passed His time protecting the calves.

8) His body adorned with a yellow dhoti and a forest-flower garland, He was like a monsoon cloud accompanied by lightning

9) His face was splendid like a mirror of pastime jewels. His drops of perspiration were like a row of stars.

10) When they saw Krsna, the young girls could not stay peaceful at heart. When they thought of Krsna's feet, the gopis were tormented by desire.

11) Their hearts burning with passion, and they fear and shyness broken to pieces, the young girls abandoned their husbands.

12) Day and night, the young girls thought of Krsna. They could not think of their household duties.

13) They thought, "Where is Krsna? What shall I do to be able to see Him?"

14) As they thought of Krsna in this way, they could see Him residing in their hearts.

15) Aware of their hearts, Krsna will manifest His yogamaya potency and enjoy a rasa\-dance pastime with them in Vrndavana forest.

16) Handsome Krsna walked by the Yamuna's shore, where the trees and vines bore many flowers.

  
17) With one heart please hear, O people, Gunaraja Khan's description of Lord Krsna's feet, a description that lifts us out of the world of birth and death.
