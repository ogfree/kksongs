**LYRICS:**

(1)

From Bombay to Bangalore

All the Hindus know the score

If you wanna live some more

Hare, hare, hare

(2)

If you do not take the vow

You can eat the sacred cow

Youll get karma anyhow

Hare, hare, hare

(Refrain)

Bow down mister

Hare Rama, Hare Krsna

Bow down mister

We say Radhe Syam

(3)

Do the right thing with your hands

Lay down on the pleasing sands

Whatever else your faith demands

Hare, hare, hare

(4)

From Bombay to Rajastan

Nitai Gaura, Radhe Syam

Hare Krsna, Hare Rama

Hare, hare, hare

(5)

In the desert jahshamire

They put kun in their hair

At the westemers they stare

Hare, hare, hare

(6)

Paint a tilak on your brow

Open like a lotus flower

Its time to check your karma now

Hare, hare, hare

(Raise your head and lift your hands to the lord)

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This popular song was sung by Boy George when he joined ISKCON for a short time. This song was also sung with famous Indian playback singer, Asha Bhosle.

Verse 4 has the line “Nitai Gaura Radhe Syam, Hare Krsna Hare Rama,” which isn’t a bona fide chant according to Srila Prabhupada.
