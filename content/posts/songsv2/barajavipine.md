**TRANSLATION**

1) In the forests of Vraja on the banks of the Yamuna there are beautiful thrones bedecked with flowers.

2) The creepers and fruit trees give satisfaction to the eyes and upon these trees and creepers many birds sing sweetly.

3) A breeze from the Malaya hills blows ever so gently while swarms of bumblebees fly about in search of honey.

4) The full glowing moon of the spring season then distributes its cooling rays out of love and respect.

5) At such a time as this, the best of relishers begins His rasa dance the holder of the flute.

6) Millions of cowherd maidens Lord Hari is in the midst dancing along with Radha rejoicing in great bliss.

7) The Enchantress of Madhava singing beautiful songs steals away the minds of all the three worlds.

8) All moving and non-moving beings enchanted by chaste Radha who has forcefully defeated the pride of Candravali.

9) After agitating the mind of youthful Vraja-Kisor Radha oh so suddenly disappears from the scene.

10) This Bhaktivinoda perceives some calamity-the rasa dance has now stopped in the absence of Radha.
