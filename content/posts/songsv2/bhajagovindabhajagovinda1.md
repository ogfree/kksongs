**LYRICS**

(1)

bhaja govinda bhaja govinda bhaja govinda kā nāma re

govinda ke nāma bina tere koī nā āve kāma re

(2)

yeh jīvana sukha duḥkha kā melā duniyā sārī svapanon kā khelā

jānā tujhko pāde akela bhaja re hari kā nāma re

(3)

govinda kī mahimā gāve prema kī usapar āga lagāke

jīvana apanā saphala banāe cala īśvara kī dhama re

**TRANSLATION**:

1) Worship Govinda! Worship Govinda! Worship Govinda’s name! Without chanting the name of Govinda, none of your desires will be fulfilled and it will be all useless.

2) In this world with the fair of happiness and distress, many desires are just a play of dreams. I want to go to alone to Your feet! Worship the name of Lord Hari! Oh!

3) By singing the glories of Lord Govinda, the heart will be aflame with love. Life will become of use. Let’s go to the divine abode of the Lord!
