You are an Ocean of Mercy

You are the Source of all Divine

You are the Reservoir of all Love

Transcendental and Sublime

(2)

Oh I am falling at your lotus feet

Seeking relief from this pain

There’s only one thing that can free me now

It is the nectar of Your Holy Name

Radhika Ramana Madhusudana

Sri Gopinatha Govinda Rama

Kesava Madhava Giridhari Rama

Sri Gopinatha Govinda Rama

Your sweet face is like a million suns

Flooding my mind

Oh You have captured me with Your Beauty

Now this heart is no longer mine

(4)

Oh I am falling at Your Lotus Feet

Seeking relief from this pain

There’s only one thing that can free me now

It is the Nectar of Your Holy Name
