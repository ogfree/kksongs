**LYRICS**

(1)

bhāi-re!  
śarīra abidyā-jāl, joḍendriya tāhe kāl,  
jīve phele viṣaya-sāgore  
tā'ra madhye jihwā ati, lobhamoy sudurmati,  
tā'ke jetā kaṭhina saḿsāre

(2)  
kṛṣṇa boro doyāmoy, koribāre jihwā jay,  
swa-prasād-anna dilo bhāi  
sei annāmṛta pāo, rādhā-kṛṣṇa-guṇa gāo,  
preme ḍāko caitanya-nitāi

**TRANSLATION**

1) O brothers! This material body is a network of ignorance, and the senses are one's deadly enemies, for they throw the soul into the ocean of material sense enjoyment. Among the senses, the tongue is the most voracious and verily wicked; it is very difficult to conquer the tongue in this world.

2) O brothers, Lord Krsna is very merciful. Just to control the tongue, He has given us the remnants of His own food! Now, please eat these nectarean grains while singing the glories of Their Lordships Sri Sri Radha and Krsna, and in love call out "Caitanya! Nitai!"

**Remarks/ Extra Information****:**

ISKCON devotees sing this set of prayers before eating prasadam, in conjunction of the verse (**[Maha Prasade Govinde](http://www.kksongs.org/songs/m/mahaprasadegovinda.html)**).
