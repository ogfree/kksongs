**TRANSLATION**

1) Lord Krsna, the supreme hero, has the most beautiful body which possesses all good features. He has the most sweet smile, He possesses extraordinary bodily strength, He is ever-youthfully beautiful, and His grave plans and actions are very difficult for anyone else to understand. He is expert at speaking meaningful words with all politeness, He is the most pleasing talker, He is the source of all nectar, and He is a wonderful linguist Who is fluent in all languages (even that of the animals and birds). He is most expert in all kinds of artistic enjoyment (He lives wonderfully at the topmost height of artistic craftsmanship), He is cunning and clever in the art of performing various types of work simultaneously, He is always joyful and untouched by any distress, and He is always self-satisfied and peaceful.

2) Krsna is grateful by never forgetting the service of His friends, He is simple and liberal, He is the best, and is very famous for His good works. He is very attractive to all women, He is very playful in amorous sports, and He possesses an eternally fresh and youthful form. He is the full manifestation of complete transcendental beauty, He is most expert at playing His all-attractive flute, and He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

3) Krsna is most grave, gentle, forgiving, peaceful and forbearing, self-composed, carefree and joking, the best lover, proud and restless, and the hero of all women. He is always surrounded by five kinds of eternal servants: 1) ceta (spies), 2)vita (dressing attendants). 3) vidusaka (clowns headed by Madhu-mangala), 4) pitha-marda (back-massagers like Sridama), 5) priya-narma-sakha (close friends.

4) Thus served by these five kinds of helpers, the Son of the King of Vraja enjoys various mellows, sometimes as a husband or as an illicit lover of others' wives. Being extremely thirsty to taste these rasas, He enjoys playing the role of four kind of heroes, as anukula (favorable), satha (deceitful), drsta (impertinent), and daksina (clever). Thus He sports in the amorous garden groves as the personification of all ecstatic mellows.
