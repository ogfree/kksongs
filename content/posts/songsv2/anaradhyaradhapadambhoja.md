**TRANSLATION**

1) Without worshiping the pollen of Sri Radha's lotus feet, without taking shelter of Vrndavana, which bears Her footprints, and without respectfully greeting the great souls whose hearts are filled with deep love for Her, how will one be able to plunge into the nectar ocean of love for Lord Krsna?

2) O friend, when, requested by playful and charming Lalita, will Sri Radha happily, sweetly, affectionately, and shyly teach me again and again your splendid and peerless new plays filled with many concealed riddles and puns and with the beautiful sound of the lute?

3) When in a secluded place will Lord Mukunda beg me in sweet words to untie the knot of Radha's jealous anger? When, seeing crooked me fallen at Sri Radha's feet to fulfill this goal, will harsh Lalita rebuke me in the cruel anger of love?  

4) May the teacher Visakha, the dear friend overcome with love for the divine couple, proudly teach me the art of preparing for the pleasure of Sri Sri Radha-Krsna the sweet madhvika nectar of many joking words mixed with the fresh camphor of charming playfulness.

5) I pray that Visakha-devi, whose voice is sweeter than the cuckoos, may teach me the art of beautiful singing. I pray that by singing during the rasa dance I will please the youthful divine couple and I will obtain from Them and Their associates many necklaces of gold and jewels as my reward.

6) When, having learned the art of cooking from Campakalata, will I make my queen, all Her dear friends, and Lord Krsna, who by a trick has come at midday to that forest place, enjoy a feast that defeats the taste of nectar? 

7) O friend, when will this person taught by Citra-gopi become filled with joy and wonder by picking up the colorful flower petals fallen from the youthful divine couple's very passionate amorous struggle in the forest grove? 

8) O friend, with her wonderful transcendental virtues Tungavidya has clearly defeated Padma and her friends in the assembly of young girls. Will this person, instructed by the clever sidelong glance of the queen of goddesses, also become the abode of all kinds of transcendental knowledge?

9) May Indulekha happily teach me to string necklaces of glittering pearls, guna, jewels, and sumanah flowers. In a cottage by Radha's favorite lake may this person decorate Sri Sri Radha-Krsna with these necklaces.

10) O friend, if she whose name bears the nectar syllables Ran#a-devi, on my request teaches me the art of dancing, then in the rasa dance I shall place in the mouths of the gracefully dancing divine couple betelnuts to make them even more expert in dancing.  

11) May Sudevi teach to me the art of dice-playing so when the divine couple play at dice in the assembly of Gokula's beautiful-eyebrowed girls with the words of my I eyes I shall declare that She who is the queen of goddesses is the winner.

12) When, clearly understanding the inscrutable verse-riddle written on a lotus petal by sweet-talking Krsna and brought by a parrot to this secluded place, will I quickly lead my queen to Him at a cave's entrance on the king of mountains?

13) Will I enter the dark cave at the right moment to see the divine couple caught in a ferocious amorous struggle, wounded by the sharp arrows of Their sidelong glances and, eager to defeat each other, tormented by the weapons of each other's teeth and nails?

14) O friend, when, the divine couple completing Their pastimes in the amorous assembly, and Their transcendental bodies together in sleep, will I, on Their order, approach and eagerly serve Them by moving a fan of flowers?

15) O moon-faced one, will I make a bed of flowers in the grove of buzzing bees? Will I make flower garlands, kunkuma, madhu nectar, and betelnuts to please the divine couple eager at heart to again enjoy transcendental amorous pastimes?  

16) When, seeing Sri Radha' sleeping, more splendid than gold, on Lord Hari's handsome chest, which defeats the splendor of the blossoming blue lotuses, will I spit with distaste at the stationary lightning flash resting on a new cloud in the sky?

17) When, having forgotten the jewel necklace She dropped during Her pastimes, and suddenly arriving with fear and embarrassment in the company of Her dearmost friends, will my queen smile on me, Her maidservant, and with dancing sidelong glances, dispatch me to recover the forgotten necklace?

18) When, with many splendidly affectionate words delighting Candravali in the company of Padma, Saibya, and her other friends, will Lord Krsna, suddenly noticing my presence, become very embarrassed, and, asking "Where is Radha?" make everyone wilt in despair?

19) O friend, holding back harsh Lalita and her proud companions and ordered both by Lord Krsna frantically searching for His lost treasure and by the dancing eyes of my queen, will Visakha angrily drag me away into exile?

20) Hearing Lord Krsna say "Your breasts are like mountains, and Your hips are like a great chariot. This boat is very old and fragile, and now there is a ferocious hurricane. How will I be able to cross to the other shore? You must stay here for the night," may Radha, pretending to be very angry, make me smile.

21) One day, the banana tree in the forest grove of my heart bursting into fruit because of the breeze from the celestial vine that bears the name Ranganalata-gopi, will I happily worship the youthful divine couple as they enjoy splendid transcendental amorous pastimes in the company of Their dear friends?
