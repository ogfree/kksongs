**LYRICS:**

(1)

dehātma buddhi yār sei jaḍa deha

sei dehe āsvādana nāhi kore keha

(2)

vaiṣṇavete jāti buddhi prabala pracura

līlā āsvādane kintu baḍa bāhādura

(3)

ḍāka gharera kerānī eka gosāñī ṭhakura

bābājī praṇām kare tāhāre pracura

(4)

gosāñī ṭhākura kore jāti abhimān

nityānanda prabhuvare kore khāna khāna

**TRANSLATION**

1) One who has the material concept that the body is his self cannot relish spiritual mellows.

2) But those who have conceptions of the Vaisnavas are very bold when it comes to relishing the lilas of the Lord.

3) Like the clerk in the post office, one goswami is as such. The babajis all pay their obeisances to him a lot.

4) To the goswami caste who has a great deal of false ego, Lord Nityananda has come to smash their ego to pieces.
