(refrain)

jāgie vrajarāja kuńvara kamala kusuma phūle

kusumavṛnda sakucita bhae bhṛńga latā bhūle

(1)    

tamacura khaga sora sunahu bolata banarāī

rāḿbhati go kharikani maiń bacharā hita dhāī

(2)

bidhu milana rabi prakāsa gāvata nara nārī

sura syāma prāta uṭhau ambuja karadhārī

**TRANSLATION**

Refrain: O young prince of Vraja! Wake up, it is morning and lotus-flowers are blooming in the ponds. The Kumudanī flowers are collapsing and bumble bees are getting out from creepers (to get to lotuses and flowers.)

1) All the birds are chirping loudly and You can also hear the rooster shout. The cow in barn is running towards her calf to feed it.

2) The moon is without shine now in the presence of resplendent sun and people are singing the morning chants and eulogies. O Śyāma of Sūradāsa! Wake up, You, Who holds a lotus flower!
