(1)

vipinahi keli kayala duhu meli

jalamāha paiṭhi karala jala-keli

(2)

nāhi uṭhala duhu mochana ańga

duhu rūpa nirakhite mūrache anańga

ańge karala duhu naba naba beśa

kabarī bānā-ola bāndhala keśa

nija nija mandire kayala payāṇa

gobinda-dāsa duhuka guṇa gāna

**TRANSLATION**

1) Meeting in the forest, They both enjoy many pastimes. Entering the water, They enjoy water-pastimes.

2) Rising from the water, They dry Their limbs. Gazing at Their transcendental forms, Kamadeva is overcome.

3) They dress in new garments. She ties His hair. He twines Her braids.

4) They walk to Their own palaces. Govinda dasa sings the divine couple's glories.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is in Raga Bhatiyara.
