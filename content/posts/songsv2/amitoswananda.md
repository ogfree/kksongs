**TRANSLATION**

1) I am a resident of Svananda-sukhada-kunja and a maidservant of the lotus feet of Radhika and Madhava.

2) At the union of the Divine Couple I rejoice, and in Their separation I die in anguish.

3) I never look at the place where Candravali and her friends stay. Whenever I see such a place it reminds me of Candravali’s gopi friend, Saibya.

4) I feel pain in my heart when I catch sight of Candravali’s girl-friends, for they are opposed to Radha.

5) Candravali wants to take away Radha’s Lord Hari, thus covering the grove of Radhika with the darkness of gloom.

6) I never look at the faces of those who are opposed to Sri Radha and Govindas joyous union.

7) Nor do I find any pleasure in conversing with those who are opposed to Radha.

8) Bhaktivinoda has enthusiastically entrusted his soul to the lotus feet of Srimati Radharani.
