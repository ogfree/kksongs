**TRANSLATION**

1) Nanda-dulala, the beloved son of Nanda, comes back from the cow pasture. His blackish form sprinkled with the dust kicked up by the cows' hooves, (He wears) a garland of forest flowers which reaches to His knees.

2-4) Hearing the sound of the cowherd boys' horns and flutes, the Brajavasis come running. Standing in the doorways of their houses, All the ladies wave plates of lamps to greet Krishna, who wears yellow garments. His face vanquishes the beauty of the full moon. He wears a fresh Manjari blossom on His ear, a peacock feather in the crown of His topknot, and plays upon His enchanting flute. All the Brajabasis, young and old, behold Him with unblinking eyes, like thirsty partridges upon finding the moon\*; they can't bear to return to their houses.

5) All the cows enter their respective sheds, and Nanda-lala walks home. Utterly delighted, Yashomati comes out to meet Him on the path. Relishable is this song of Mohana.
