**LYRICS:**

(1)

sakhi, kevā śunāila śyāma-nāma

kānera bhitara diyā, marame paśila go

ākula karila mora prāṇa

(2)

na jāni kateka madhu, śyāma-nāme āche go

vadana chāḍite nāhi pāre

japite japite nāma, avaśa karila go

kemane pāiba, sai, tare

(3)

nāma-paratāpe jā’ra, aichana karila go

ańgera paraśe kivā haya

jekhāne vasati tā’ra, sekhāne thākhiya go

yuvatī dharama kaiche raya

(4)

pāsarite cahi mane, pāsarā nā jāya go

ki kariba ki habe upāya

kahe dvija-caṇḍidāse, kulavatī kula-nāśe

apanāre yauvana jācāya

**TRANSLATION**

1) O my dear sakhi, who is that person who first made Me hear this name “Syama”? When it enters My heart through My ears, I become overwhelmed with impatience.

2) I don’t know how much sweetness fills this name. It is so sweet that My tongue will not leave it for a moment. As I go on repeating this name, I become completely absorbed. O sakhi, how will I ever be able to meet Him?

3) If that person’s name alone has the power to put Me in such a condition, I cannot even imagine what My condition would be if I were to touch His body. Wherever He stays, how can the young women maintain their religious principles?

4) In My heart I want to forget Him, but I cannot. Now I cannot understand what is the remedy, what to do. Dvija Candidasa says, “Simply by displaying His youthful beauty, that Syamananda has destroyed the whole dynasty of young cultured ladies.”

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

The first word of the song can be changed to “sai.”
