**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) Beautiful glorious Radha, the crest-jewel of Vraja's beautiful girls, has come!

1) Her curly hair is graceful. Her garments have no peer. Her graceful gestures are plunged in nectar, O! Her lips are red. Her limbs are a wave-filled stream of nectar. A joyful girl is Her companion, O!

2) Her glorious graceful motions are like those of a graceful elephant. Her teeth are like pearls. She is wonderful to behold, wonderful like a lightning flash, O!

3) She is filled with ever-new spiritual love. She possesses all auspiciousness and good fortune. She sings enchanting melodies in the fifth raga, O! She enjoys pastimes of rasa\-dancing. She blossoms with smiles. She is splendidly manifest in Govinda dasa's heart, O!

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is sung in Raga Sri.
