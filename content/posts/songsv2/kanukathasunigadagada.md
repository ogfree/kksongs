**LYRICS:**

(1)

kānu-kathā śuni gadagada bhāṣa

milati sahacarī rā-ika pāśa

(2)

kahatahi sahacarī śuna bara gora

tuyā lāgi hālata nanda-kiśora

  
(3)

tuyā rūpa nirakha-i taru de-i kora

hera-ite galatahi locana-lora

(4)

yaba nahi sundara karabi payāna

taba jī\-u tejaba nāgara kāna

(5)

saha-i nā pāra-i madana-hutāśa

cāmara ḍhulāyata gobinda-dāsa

**TRANSLATION**

1) After hearing Krsna speak broken words in a choked voice, the gopis approached Radha.

2) The gopis said: O beautiful fair girl, please listen. Nanda's son trembles with love for You.

3) Thinking it is Your beautiful form, He embraces a tree. Tears stream from His eyes.

4) If You do not go to Him, the hero Krsna will give up His life.

5) He has no power to bear Kamadeva's flames that now surround Him. As these words are spoken, Govinda dasa moves the camara\-whisk.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is sung in Raga Dhanasri.
