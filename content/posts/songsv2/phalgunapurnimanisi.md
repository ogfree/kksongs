**LYRICS:**

(1)

phalguna-purnima nisi      saci-ankakase asi

gauracandra ha-ila udaya

se sasira sahacara       bhakta-taraka-nikara

cari\-dike prakasita haya

(2)

papa ghora andhakara       sarbatra chila bistara

bidhudaye prasthana karila

jibera bhagya kumuda          hari sasi mano-mada

premanande hasite lagila

(3)

papa ama\-nisi bhora        harire bhakta-cakora

tulila ananda kolahala

prema-kaumudira sudha         piye dura kaila krudha

saba-i ha-ila su-sitala

(4)

se prema-sudhara kana      pana tapta sarba-jana

jiba-kula bhela anandita

apana karama dore        na pa-iya naba lese

prema-dasa dhulaya lunthita

**TRANSLATION**

1) On the full-moon night of Phalguna month, the moon of Lord Gaura arose in the sky of Saci's lap. Around that moon in the four directions the stars of the devotees shone.

2) When that moon rose the horrible all-pervading darkness of sin was chased far away. Seeing that moon, the lotus flowers of the people's good fortune smiled with ecstatic love. Their hearts became wild with bliss.

3) The cakora birds of the devotees, long distraught over the moonless night of sins, now let out a blissful clamor. Drinking the nectar moonlight, those birds felt their hunger flee far away. Everyone became filled with cooling bliss.

4) Drinking that nectar moonlight of spiritual love, the living entities became filled with bliss. Because of his past misdeeds, Prema dasa did not drink even a single ray of that nectar moonlight. That is why he now rolls about in the dust.
