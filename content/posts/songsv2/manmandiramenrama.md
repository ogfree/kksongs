**LYRICS:**

(1)

mana mandira meń rāma base hai

tana mandira meń sīyā

hṛdaya bhavana meń dono base to

sadā jale mana diyā sīyā rāma

(2)

paga dhāye tiratha dhāma kiyo

choḍ ke jaga kī māyā

hātha pujana meń mukha bhajana meń

prabhu daraśana meń ańkhiyāń

(3)

rāma nāma se subahā hotī

har pal dina mahinā

rāma nāma se sāla bīte

bītī sāri umariyā

**TRANSLATION**

1) In the temple of the mind resides Lord Rama. In the temple of the body, Sita resides. In the room of the heart, when both of Them reside together, the mind remains illuminated with the chant of Sita! Rama!

2) With my feet, I go to the pilgrimage of holy abodes of the Lord leaving the world of maya. I engage my hands in Deity worship, I engage my mouth in chanting devotional songs, and I engage my eyes in seeing the Lord.

3) In the morning, the name of Lord Ramacandra takes place lasting every moment, every day, and every month. With Rama’s name, a year passes. With Rama’s name, an entire lifetime passes.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is popularized by Gautam in his 1997 recording of the album “Bhakti Kusum.”
