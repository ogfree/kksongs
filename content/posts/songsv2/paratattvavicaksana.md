(1)

hari he

para-tattwa bicakṣaṇa   byāsa ādi muni-gaṇa

śāstra bicāriyā bāra bāra

prabhu taba nitya-rūpa  guṇa-śīla anurūpa

tomāra caritra sudhā-sāra

(2)

śuddha-sattwa-moyī līlā  mukhya-śāstre prokāśila

jībera kuśala su-bidhāna

rajas-tamo-guṇa-andha  asura\-prakṛti-manda\-

jane tāhā bujhita nā jāne

(3)

nāhi māne nitya-rūpa  bhajiyā maṇḍūka-kūpa

rahe tāhe udāsīna prāya

e bhaktibinoda gāya  ki durdaiba haya hāya

hari-dāsa nāhi hari pāya

**TRANSLATION**

(1-2) Oh my Lord! All the great sages headed by Srila Vyasadeva are most experienced and wise regarding the transcendental truth. This is because they discuss and deliberate on the revealed scriptures again and again. Thereby they help to manifest these sacred literatures which reveal Your eternal personal form abounding in all virtuous qualities, Your divine character which is the very essence of ambrosial nectar as well as Your eternal pastimes of pure transcendental goodness. These principle scriptures thus prescribe the path of auspicious well-being for all souls. However, those unfortunate souls who are blinded by the material modes of passion and ignorance, who harbor the nature of demons, and who are foolish and dull-minded cannot possibly understand Your divine form or pastimes which are described throughout all these scriptures.

3) Those who live in this universe but are not interested in Your eternal form remain completely oblivious just like ignorant frogs who live in a small, shallow well. Now Bhaktivinoda sings, alas! What an unfortunate, sorry situation has arisen here! For it seems that the eternal servants of Hari have not become fixed up in the service of their eternal Lord Hari.
