**TRANSLATION**

1) Oh, my most youthful Lord Gaura-Kisora! When will You be merciful and show Yourself to me, thus stealing my mind within the forest of Godruma?

2) Within the grove of Ananda-sukhada-kunja, You stand with Sri Gadadhara on Your left side, radiating the effulgence of pure gold. With beautiful curling hair, You are wearing the fine dress of a dramatic actor.

3) In an instant Sri Sri Radha-Madhava will appear and brilliantly illuminate the entire scene. Accompanied by all of Their confidential friends and associates, They will dance with Their necks decorated with various types of golden necklaces.

4) The merciful Ananga-Manjari, catching the hands of this maidservant, will take me to offer me in devotion unto Sri Sri Radha-Madhava, and my eyes will be brimming with pleasure to behold the beauty and sweetness of Them both.

**Remarks/ Extra Information****:**

This prayer is submitted by Bhaktivinoda Thakura unto Sri Sri Gaura-Gadadhara, his personal deities at his house in Godruma.
