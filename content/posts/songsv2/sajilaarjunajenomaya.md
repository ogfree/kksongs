**LYRICS:**

(1)

sājila arjuna jena māyā baddha nara

mohitera nyāya hoilo pāṇḍava sodara

(2)

ātmīya svajana hiḿsā pare rājya bhoga

īthe hibā sukha – pārtha dekhāilā śoka

(3)

sei to “dehātma budhi” ātmīya jñāna ka’re

kṣatriya hoiyā snehe yuddha kṣetre chāḍe

(4)

moha dekhi kṛṣṇa tā’ra korilo nindana

ataeva arjuna koilo siṣyatva grahaṇa

**TRANSLATION**

1) Arjuna acted just like a conditioned soul bound by illusion. The Pandava brother was bewildered as such.

2) Violence to his relatives and then enjoyment of the kingdom. Could this truly lead to happiness? Arjuna showed lamentation, in this way.

3) This though, was all identification with the body, one who is a ksatriya gives up such family affection on the battlefield.

4) Upon seeing Arjuna bound by illusion, Krsna chastised him. Therefore, Arjuna accepted discipleship.
