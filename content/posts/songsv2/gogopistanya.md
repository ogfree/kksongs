**TRANSLATION**

1) O Krsna, You drank the breast-milk of the cows and gopis, and their love for You increased more and more. In this way You bewildered Lord Brahma, although Lord Brahma clearly understood (that the boys and calves were all Your expansions).

2) O Krsna, revealing that each of these forms was Your own spiritual form, You caused Lord Brahma to become greatly amazed. Lord Brahma felt helpless, and he awakened (to a proper understanding of Krsna's status).

3) O Krsna, within Yourself You considered Lord Brahma to be very insignificant, although externally You tried to please him. O Lord, who appears like a charming cowherd boy holding a morsal of food in Your hand, please protect me.

4) O Krsna, seeing that new boys and calves were created, Lord Brahma became embarrassed. Understanding the truth about You, He glorified You by offering prayers, and he washed Your lotus feet with His tears of joy.
