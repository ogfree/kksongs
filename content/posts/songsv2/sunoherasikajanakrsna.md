**LYRICS:**

(1)

śuna, he rasikajana kṛṣṇa guṇa agaṇana

ananta kahite nāhi pāre

kṛṣṇa jagatera guru kṛṣṇa vāñcākalpataru

nāvika se bhava-pārābāre

(2)

hṛdaya pīṛita jā’ra kṛṣṇa cikitsaka tā’ra

bhava roga nāśite catura

kṛṣṇa bahirmmukha jane premāmṛta vitaraṇe

krame laya nija antaḥpura

(3)

karmma-bandha jñāna-bandha, āveśe mānava andha

tā’re kṛṣṇa karuṇā sāgara

pādapadma madhū diyā, andhabhāva ghucāiyā

caraṇe karena anucara

(4)

vidhimārga rata jane svādhīnatā ratna dāne

rāgamārge karāna praveśa

rāga-baśavartti ha’ye pārakīya-bhāvāśraye

labhe jīva kṛṣṇa-premāveśa

(5)

premāmṛta-vāri-dhāra sadā pānarata tāń’rā

kṛṣṇa tāń’hādera bandhū pati

sei saba braja-jana sukalyāṇa-niketana

dīnahīna vinodera gati

**TRANSLATION**

1) Listen to this, oh wisest relishers of mellows! The transcendental qualities of Sri Krsna are innumerable; indeed it is not possible to describe such unlimited divine attributes. Krsna is the spiritual master of the entire universe, He is like a wish fulfilling desire-tree, and He is the helmsman of the boat on the ocean of material existence.

2) Krsna is just like a doctor for those whose hearts are ailing, as He is very expert at destroying the diseased condition of material existence. By distributing the nectar of ecstatic love to all the inimical souls, He gradually takes them back into His own confidential realm.

3) Krsna is an ocean of compassion for those who are bound up in fruitive reactions, as well as for those bound up in philosophical speculation, and for those blinded by other human perplexities. Giving the honey of His lotus feet, and thus relieving the darkness of such worldliness, He makes one an attendant of His own feet.

4) Krsna eventually bestows the jewel of independence unto those persons who are attached to the path of rules and regulations, thereby allowing them entrance into the path of spontaneous loving service. Becoming influenced by such spontaneity, remaining under the shelter of the mellows of unwedded love (parakiya-bhava), the soul finally attains all the symptoms of ecstatic love for Krsna.

5) Krsna is the dear most friend and husband of those who are always attached to drinking the fountain of ecstatic tears of love. Thus, the goal of this most fallen and lowly Bhaktivinoda is to be with all such residents of Vraja within the abode of Supreme auspiciousness.
