**LYRICS:**

(Refrain)

jaya jaya nita-i gaura abatara

hari-nama prabala tarani abalambaye

karunaya karala uddhara

(1)

bhaba sagara bara duratara duragraha

duranta gati su-bithara

nimagana jagata  patita saba akula

ko-i na pa-ola para

(2)

aja bhaba adi byasa suka narada

anta na paya-i yanra

aichana prema patita jane bitara-i

ko achu karuna apara

(3)

hena abatara ara kiye hoyaba

rasika bhakata-gana mela

dina ghanasyama  sonari bhela jara jara

hadi maha rahi gela sela

**TRANSLATION**

Refrain: Glory glory to Lord Gaura and Lord Nitai who descended to this world! Kindly picking up the drowning souls They placed them in the strong boat of Lord Krsna’s holy names and delivered them.

1) The ocean of repeated birth and death is horrible and wide. The people of the world were drowning in it. The fallen souls were distraught. No one could swim to the shore.

2) Even Brahma, Siva, Vyasa, Sukadeva, Narada, and all the demigods and sages could not find that ocean's shore. To the fallen people, Lord Gaura and Lord Nitai gave the gift of ecstatic spiritual love. Who has limitless mercy like Them?

3) Will there ever be another avatara like Them? They were surrounded by a host of rasika devotees. Remembering Them, poor Ghanasyama is overcome. He feels as if a javelin is pushed into his heart.
