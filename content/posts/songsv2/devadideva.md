**TRANSLATION**

1) The Lord of lords, Sri Gauracandra, along with Nityananda Prabhu is pleasurably engaged in His pastimes in Gauridasa Pandita’s house in Ambika Kalna.

2) Gaurasundara adorns Himself with a very beautiful, red gunja-mala, which falls over His lotus heart. Brahma and Laksmi worship His lotus feet with great respect.

3) His body shines brilliantly like molten gold, and His cloth is saffron like the rising sun. He desires that prema-bhakti like the anuraga of Srimati Radhika.

4) The son of Saci, Gaurasundara, who is so joyful inside, is roaming about with Nityananda Prabhu, purifying the hearts of the atheists.

5) Both Nityananda and Gaurasundara are in the house of Gauridasa, who hopes that They will deliver all jivas.
