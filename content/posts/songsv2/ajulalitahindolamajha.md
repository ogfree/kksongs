**LYRICS**

(1)

āju lalita hindolā mājha

rańge jhulato nāgara rāja

rāi suvadani vāma pāśa

koto hu ānanda sāyare bhāsa

(2)

kibā adabhuta duhuka śobhā

nāhiko upamā bhuvane lobhā

duhuka vadana duhu se heri

hāsi cumba dei beri beri

(3)

āńkhi bhańgi kori koteko bhāńti

kohe gada gada rabhase māti

lalitādi sakhi se sukhe bhāsi

nehāre dohāra vadana śaśi

(4)

rańge jhulāyato manda manda

miliyā gāoyate pada suchanda

bājate veṇu vīṇā upāńga

madhura mṛdańga muraja cańga

(5)

keho nāce koto bhańgi kori

ati mohita tā dohe heri

sura-nārī nija gaṇa sańge

puṣpa vṛṣṭi koroto rańge

jaya śabada vṛndāvana bhari

śuni rańge māte narahari

**TRANSLATION**

1) “Today Lalita blissfully pushes Nagara Raja as He sits on the swing with fair-faced Rai on His left side, floating in an ocean of transcendental bliss.”

2) “How wonderful is Their beauty! Nothing in the world can compare to Them! Looking at Each other’s faces they laugh and kiss Each other time and again.”

3) “The Divine Pair makes so many gestures with the eyes and speak so many disordered words with faltering voices. Lalita and the other sakhis float in bliss as they behold Their moon-like faces.”

4) “Blissfully and slowly They swing and together They sing nicely composed songs, play flute, vina, upanga and sweet mrdanga and muraja\-drums.”

5) “Some are dancing, making so many gestures, looking at the Divine Pair in total fascination, while the goddesses in the sky blissfully shower flowers. The whole of Vrndavana is filled with the sounds of ‘Jaya’, and Narahari is raving when he hears it.”

**Remarks/ Extra Information****:**

This song is to be sung in Raga Kedara in a twelve matra cycle known as Ektal.
