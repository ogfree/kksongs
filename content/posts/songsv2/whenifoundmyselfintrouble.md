**LYRICS:**

(1)

When I found myself in times of trouble, Prabhupada comes to me,

Speaking words of wisdom: Hari Bol!

And in my hour of darkness He is standing right in front of me,

Speaking words of wisdom - let it be.

Chant your rounds Chant your rounds

Chant your rounds Sixteen Rounds

Whispered words of wisdom: Hari Bol!

(2)

And when the broken hearted people living in the world agree,

There will be an answer Hari Bol!

For thought they maybe parted,

There is still a change that they will see

There will be an answer: Hari Bol!

Chant your rounds Chant your rounds

Chant your rounds Sixteen Rounds

Whispered words of wisdom: Hari Bol!

(3)

And when the night is cloudy, there is still a light that shines on me

Shines until tomorrow - let it be.

I wake up to the sound of japa, Prabhupada still comes to me,

Speaking words of wisdom - let it be.

Chant your rounds Chant your rounds

Chant your rounds Chant your rounds

There will be an answer: Hari Bol!

Chant your rounds Chant your rounds

Chant your rounds Sixteen Rounds

Whispered words of wisdom: Hari Bol!
