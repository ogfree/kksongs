**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) The one who sports in Vrndavana is my Rai (Radharani). My Rai! O My Rai! Syama is yours.

1) Suka (the male parrot) says, “My Krsna is the enchanter of cupid.” Sari says, “Only when Radha is on His left side. Otherwise, He is just a cupid.”

2) Suka says, “My Krsna lifted up Govardhana Hill.” Sari says, “My Radha empowered Him to do so. Otherwise, He couldn’t do it.”

3) Suka says, “My Krsna wears a peacock feather on His head.” Sari says, “My Radha’s name is on there. Just go and see!”

4) Suka says, “My Krsna’s crown leans to the left.” Sari says, “Yes, to touch my Radha’s feet.”

5) Suka says, “My Krsna is the life and soul of Mother Yasoda.” Sari says, “My Radha is the life and soul of life, otherwise, life is void.”

6) Suka says, “My Krsna is the cintamani (a jewel that fulfills desires) of the world.” Sari says, “My Radha is the giver of divine love and even Your Krsna knows this!”

7) Suka says, “My Krsna plays the flute.” Sari says, “it calls Radha’s name, otherwise we wouldn’t hear of it.”

8) Suka says, “My Krsna is the spiritual master of the world.” Sari says, “My Radha is a kalpataru tree (desire tree). Otherwise, who is the spiritual master?”

9) Suka says, “My Krsna is the beggar of love.” Sari says, “My Radha is the waves of love.”

10) Suka says, “My Krsna stays under a kadamba tree.” Sari says, “Only because my Radha comes and goes. Otherwise, He wouldn’t stay here.”

11) Suka says, “My Krsna is the black of the world.” Sari says, “My Radha is the light of the world, otherwise the black cannot be seen.”

12) Suka says, “My Krsna is the servant of Radhika.” Sari says, “You spoke the truth, as His flute is the witness. Otherwise, He’d be a beggar.”

13) Suka says, “My Krsna is the life and soul of the world.” Sari says, “My Radha is the the cool sweet breeze, otherwise life cannot remain.”

14) Suka says, “My Krsna is the life and soul of the universe.” Sari says, “My Radha is the giver of life. Otherwise life cannot remain.”

15) Suka and Sari ended their argument. Filled with love, they chanted “Hari Hari Bol” and flown off to Vrndavana!
