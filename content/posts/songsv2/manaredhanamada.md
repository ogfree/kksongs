**LYRICS:**

(1)

mane re, dhana-mada nitanta asar

dhana jana bitta jata, e deher anugata,

deho gele se sakala char

(2)

bidyar jateka cesta, cikitsaka upadesta

keho deho rakhibare nare

ajapa hoile sesa, deha-matra abasesa,

jiba nahi thakena adhere

(3)

dhane jadi prana dita, dhani raja na marita,

dharamar hoit ravana

dhane nahi rakhe deho, deho gele nahe keho,

ataeva ki koribe dhana?

(4)

jadi thake bahu dhana, nije ho'be akincana,

baisnaber koro upakar

jibe doya anuksana, radha-krsna-aradhana,

koro sada ho'ye sadacar

**TRANSLATION**

1) Oh my dear mind, you are greatly intoxicated by your wealth and possessions, but just let me tell you that this is completely useless. When this body is gone, your wealth, followers, property as well as everything else that depends on this body will be good for nothing at all.

2) Despite all the vast medical knowledge and dexterous efforts of the advising physician, one will never be able to keep this temporary body. When the life airs expire, the only thing which will be left behind is the gross body, for the soul cannot remain trapped within such a dead container for very long.

3) If wealth had the power to prolong life, then a rich king would never have to die. The demon named Ravana also thought that he possessed deathlessness, until he was finally killed by Lord Rama. Thus we see that no one to date has ever been able to protect and keep his body with any amount of money, for no one can prevent his body from dying. Therefore what is the use of your riches?

4) Dear mind, if you have any excess wealth, then just make yourself lowly and humble and use that wealth to do something beneficial for the service of the Vaisnavas. Constantly showing compassion to all souls, worship Radha-Krsna and always make your standard of behavior clean, saintly and virtuous.
