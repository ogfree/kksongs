**LYRICS:**

(1)

jab murali apane ādhāre dhari

kyā prem prīti bharī tune bharī

ke bhakta vṛnda kahane lāgi “hari hari”

aise bajāyā kanhaiyā bāńsuri

(2)

brija meń nanda lāl bajāte jab woh dhun baḍi

pañchi gāne lage nāce māyuri

gope gopīyā sab ho gayi bāvarī

(3)

vṛṣabhānu nandinī rādhāraṇī

ho gayī kanhaiyā kī prema dīvānī

yamunā ke tīre bajāyi jis ghaḍī

**TRANSLATION**

1) When You put Your lips on Your flute, You fill it with love and love, such that the assembly of devotees feel like saying, “Hari! Hari!” Such is the way Kanhaiya plays the flute.

2) Whenever the son of Nanda Maharaja plays the flute in this great tune, birds begin to sing along while peacocks dance. All cowherd boys and girls become mad with love.

3) Radharani, the beloved daughter of Vrsabhanu, became madly in love with Kanhaiya. The tune played by the Yamuna’s banks at the moment was, “such is the way Kanhaiya plays the flute.”
