**LYRICS:**

(1)

bhaja mana rādhe kṛṣṇa govinda

yā-ko nāma\-hi mocita bhava-bandhana

hota\-hi prema-ānanda

(2)

e śuka śańkara sanaka sanātana

anta nāhi pāoye ananta

yā-ko nāma\-hi tri-bhuvana-mańgala

aharniśi japata\-hi santa

(3)

yā-ko nāma\-hi surāsura-nara-vara

muni-gaṇa karata dheyāna

yā-ko nāma rauta nārada sadā

bhuvana phirata kara gāna

(4)

veda\-hi yā-ko yaśa guṇa gāota

karata\-hi nāma-ki āśa

tā-ko nāma\-hi pāpi-jana vañcita

rohiṇīnandana-dāsa

**TRANSLATION**

1) O my mind, just worship and chant the names, “Radhe! Krishna! Govinda!” What a name! Just by uttering it, one becomes free from the bondage of birth and death and receives ecstatic prema.

2) Suka, Sankara, Sanaka and Sanatan and even Ananta Sesa cannot find the limit of the holy name. What a name!  It is auspicious for all the three worlds and is chanted day and night by saintly persons.

3) What a name! It is meditated on by the best of the gods, demons, men and munis. Always chanting the holy name, Narada Muni roams about the universe.

4) The Vedas sing only of the glories and wonderful qualities of the holy name, and the followers of the Vedas place all of their hopes on the holy name alone. It is certain that only sinful persons like Rohininandan Das are cheated by being deprived of the holy name.
