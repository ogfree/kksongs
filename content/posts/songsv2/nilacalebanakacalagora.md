**LYRICS:**

(1)

nīlācale banakācala gora

gobinda phāgu-rańge bhela bhora

(2)

deba-kumārī nāgarī-gaṇa sańga

govinda phagu ranga bhela bhora

(3)

deva-kumari nari gana sane

pulake kadamba karambita anga

(4)

phagu khelata gaura tanu

prema sudha sindhu murati janu

(5)

phagu aruna tanu arunahi cira

banka nayane jhara aruna hi nira

(6)

kanthe hi lohita arunima mala

aruna bhakata-gana ga rasala

(7)

kata kata bhava vitharala anga

nayana dulayata prema taranga

(8)

heri gadadhara lahu lahu hasa

so nahi samughala govinda dasa

**TRANSLATION**

1-2) At Nilacala Puri, the golden mountain Gora becomes overwhelmed in the bhavas of Govinda's Holi festival. While re-enacting this pastime with Lord Jagannatha's devadasis, His body erupts with goose bumps the size of kadamba flowers!

3-6) The kumari devadasis throw red powder over Gora's limbs. O, His body forms a nectar ocean of prema. Thus everyone's body and clothes becomes red, as red tears stream from their sidelong glances. The flower garlands around everyone's necks turn red and so do bhaktas as they sweetly sing.

5-8) All sorts of ecstatic symptoms surge from Gauranga's body, and Gadadhara looks on with a tender smile, Govinda dasa says: I cannot understand why.  Pastimes Govinda dasa has no power to understand.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is in Raga Basanta.
