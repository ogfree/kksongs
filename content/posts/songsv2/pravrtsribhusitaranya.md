**TRANSLATION**

1) O Krsna, when the beauty of the monsoon season decorated the forest, You performed pastimes in the caves and under the large forest-trees, eating their fruits and roots.

2) O Krsna, I offer respectful obeisances unto You. Sitting on a stone and eating Your lunch of rice and yogurt, You and Your cowherd friends are delighted by the autumn rains. Nourishing the fresh grasses, those rains worship You with their manifestation of charming beauty.

3) O Krsna, please be merciful unto me. The beautiful luster of Your form is like the clear autumn sky and Your face is like the splendid autumn moon. You have become the supreme cupid for the gopis.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is based on Srimad Bhagavatam Canto 10 Chapter 20.
