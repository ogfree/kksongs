**LYRICS:**

(1)

mākhana kī corī cora kāmare mai samajhā rahī toye

mai samajhā rahī toye lāile, mai samajhā rahī toye

(2)

na lakhā gaiyā nanda bābā ko, nita naya mākhana hoye

tāu ke tu corī kare, lāja na āve toye

(3)

hāta bāta gaja becana hāri, gaiyā ulahano hoya

bane nāma hai nanda bābā ko, hāsī hamārī hoya

(4)

barasānā pe bhai sadā lalā, nita naya carcā hoya

bane bāpa kī rādhā beṭī, naya bhare gī toye

(5)

mākhana corī chute na maiyā, hona hāra to toya

sūrya dāsa yaśodā ke āge, sadaka sadaka gaye toye

**TRANSLATION**

1) Mother Yasoda says to her son, “I am trying to make You understand, my child, that it is naughty to steal butter.”

2) “Nanda Baba has nine-hundred thousand cows who give fresh butter daily. Yet, still You steal butter from Your uncle’s house without feeling ashamed.”

3) “All the village people are speaking about Your mischievous activities. Nanda Baba has such a high reputation, but now everyone is laughing at us.”

4) “When the residents of Varsana meet together in the evening,

there is always some fresh gossip. And now the name of Radha, the daughter of a reputable father, is connected with You.”

5) Surya dasa looks on as Krsna stands panting before Yasoda while saying, “I cannot stop stealing butter, Maiya! – what will be, will be.”
