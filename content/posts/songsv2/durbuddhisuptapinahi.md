**TRANSLATION**

1) O Krsna, one day Your friends saw a gigantic sleeping serpent (on the path). You earnestly desired to protect Your innocent friends from that serpent, who was known as Aghasura, whose mind was full of demoniac plans and who had performed many abominable deeds.

2) O Krsna, You then became very anxious (for the protection of Your friends). Entering within the demoniac serpent Agha, You killed him, and thus saved the lives of the calves and the cowherd boys.

3) O Krsna, in this way, you delighted the demigods, liberated the offensive Agha demon, and amazed Lord Brahma. O Lord, O ocean of amazing (pastimes), I offer respectful obeisances unto You.
