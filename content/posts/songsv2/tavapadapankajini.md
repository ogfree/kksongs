**LYRICS:**

(1)

hari he

taba pada-pańkajinī        jībāmṛta-sañcāriṇī

ati-bhāgye jība tāhā pāya

se amṛta pāna kori'      mugdha hoya tāhā hori

āra tāhā chāḍite nā cāya

(2)

nibiṣṭa hoiyā tāya       anya sthāne nāhi jāya

anya rasa tuccha kori' mane

madhu-pūrṇa-padma-sthita      madhubrata kadācita

nāhi cāya ikhu-daṇḍa-pāne

(3)

e bhaktibinoda kabe      se pańkaja-sthita ha'be

nāhi ja'be soḿsārābhimukhe

bhakta-kṛpā bhakti-bala       ei duiṭī su-sambala

pāile se sthiti ghaṭe sukhe

**TRANSLATION**

1) Oh my Lord Hari! Your lotus feet distribute the nectar of eternal devotional service to the surrender souls, and only by dint of the greatest good fortune can any soul drink such nectar. By drinking this rare ambrosia they become attracted and captivated, and by being completely absorbed in this transcendental honey of devotion, they will never want to abandon drinking it.

2) Being deeply engrossed in this jivamrta, they will never ever go anywhere else, for they will then consider all other tastes to be simply insignificant and verily nauseating. It is just like when a bee is fully satisfied, tasting the sweet honey within the whorl of a lotus flower, then he won't even consider the inferior sweetness of sugarcane juice.

3) Bhaktivinoda now says that when I become situated at those lotus-like feet, then I will never again go towards the material world. And I will happily attain a place at those lotus feet only due to two most auspicious things... the causeless mercy of the devotee and the power of devotion.
