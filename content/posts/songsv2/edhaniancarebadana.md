**LYRICS:**

(1)

e dhani āñcare badana jhāmpāńa

lubadhala madhupacakora bidhuntuda

ānata ānata cali yāńa

(2)

mukha-maṇḍala kiyeśārada saroruha

bhālahi aṣṭamīka canda

madhuripu maramabharama yāhā aichana

tāre ki gaṇiye mati manda

(3)

jani kaha garabe  pāṇi-tale bāraba

e thala\-kamala ujora

tahi nakha-cāndabharama bhare aichana

tatahiḿ paḍata jani bhora

(4)

bhāńa dhanuyā kiyesutanu dhunāyasi

yachu śare giridhara kāmpa

se kiye atanu   pataga śire ḍārasi

gobinda-dāsa hiye tāpa

**TRANSLATION**

1) With the edge of her garment a beautiful gopi gets shy and covers her face. She has become like a greedy bumblebee or a cakora bird. Yearning and yearning, she walks.

2) Is the half-covered circle of her face really an autumn lotus? Is her forehead a moon on the eighth night? She enchants Krsna's heart. Now He is bewildered. What does Krsna think now?

3) The palm of her hand eclipses the land-growing lotus. The moons of her fingernails enchant and bewilder Krsna. Now He is overcome.

4) She bends the archer's bow of her eyebrows. An arrow is fired. Now Krsna trembles. Did Kamadeva's arrow strike Krsna's head? Govinda dasa says: Lord Krsna's heart is now consumed by flames.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is sung in Raga Bihaga.
