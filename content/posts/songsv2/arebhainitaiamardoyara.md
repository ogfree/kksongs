**LYRICS:**

(1)

āre bhāi nitāi āmāra dayāra avadhi

jīvera karuṇā kari  deśe deśe phiri phiri

prema-dhana yāce nirabadhi

(2)

adwaitera sańge rańga         dharaṇe nā yāya ańga

gorā-preme gaḍhā tanu-khāni

ḍhuliyā ḍhuliyā cale           bahu tili hari bale

du'-nayane bahe nitā-ira pāṇi

(3)

kapāle tilaka śobhe      kuṭila kuntala lole

guñjāra āṇṭunī cūḍā tāya

keśarī jiniyā kaṭi        kaṭi-taṭe nīla dhaṭi

bājana nūpura rāńgā pāya

(4)

bhubana mohana beśa       majā-ila saba deśa

rasābeśe aṭṭa aṭṭa hāsa

prabhu mora nityānanda       kebala ānanda-kanda

guṇa gāya bṛndābana dāsa

**TRANSLATION**

1) O Brothers! My Nitai's mercy is limitless. He wanders village to village giving love of God to one and all.

  
2) He always jokes with Advaita Acarya. His whole body is made of love for Gauranga. He is always intoxicated with the divine mood of love, thus is unable to walk properly. He raises his arms and sings "Haribol!" and He sheds tears from His two lotus eyes.

  
3) Sri Nityananda is adorned with the tilaka on His forehead. He has curly hair matted with red berries. A blue belt encircles His lion-like waist. His feet look red. He wears anklebells on his reddish feet always making a tinkling, tinkling sound.

4) His beauty enchants the whole world. He smiles and laughs while in the divine mood of love! Lord Nityananda Prabhu is my master. He's full of nothing but pleasure. Thus, Vrndavana Dasa sings His glories.
