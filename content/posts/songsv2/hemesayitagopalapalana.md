**TRANSLATION**

1) O Lord Krsna, as You and Your cowherd boy friends were playing the game of police, and thieves who steal lambs, a demon named Vyomasura assumed the form of a cowherd boy, and stole many of Your friends.

2) O Lord Krsna, all glories unto You. You grasped Vyomasura, the son of Mayasura, threw him to the ground (and killed him). You rescued the cowherd boys who had been locked up by him in the mountain caves.
