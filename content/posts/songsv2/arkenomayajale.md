**LYRICS:**

(1)

ār keno māyā-jāle poḍitecho, jīva-mīn

nāhi jāno baddha ho’ye ro’be tumi ciro-din

(2)

ati tuccha bhoga-āśe, bandī ho’ye māyā-pāśe

rohile vikṛta-bhāve daṇḍya jathā parādhīn

(3)

ekhona bhakati-bale, kṛṣṇa-prema-sindhu-jale

krīḍā kori’ anāyāse thāko tumi kṛṣṇaādhīna

**TRANSLATION**

1) O fish like soul, why have you fallen into the entangling nets of Maya? You have not understood that being bound up by those nets you will have to remain in this material world for a long, long time.

2) After becoming captive in Maya’s snare due to your desires for insignificant enjoyments, you remain transformed in a spiritually diseased condition, punishable just like a disobedient servant.

3) Now, by the power of devotional service, always remain subservient to Lord Krsna, swimming and frolicking freely in the nectarine ocean of Krsna-prema.
