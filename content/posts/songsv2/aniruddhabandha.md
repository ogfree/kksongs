**TRANSLATION**

O Lord who made a plan to rescue Aniruddha, O Lord who left Your own abode and went to Banasura's kingdom, O Lord who fought with Siva, O Lord whose fame is pure and glorious, O Lord fought in a battle with a great multitude of weapons, O Lord who with a yawning weapon defeated Siva, O Lord who again and again defeated Banasura, O Lord who in the midst of the battle was embarrassed to see the limbs of Kotara, who was like a mother to Banasura, O Lord who turned away from her, O Lord who showed mercy by with Your own jvara weapon defeating Siva's jvara weapon, O Lord whose glories are proclaimed again and again, O Lord who cut off the arms of Bali Maharaja's demon-son, Banasura, O Lord who was pleased by Siva's prayers, O Lord who is very merciful, O Lord who made Banasura a personal associate of Siva, O Lord who expertly rescued Aniruddha from the prison of arrows and ropes, O Lord who pleased Your kinsmen, O Lord who returned home with Aniruddha and his bride, O Lord whose pastimes are beyond the power of human beings, O Lord who returned to Vraja, played the flute at Your lips, and pleased everyone, O prince of the gopas, O master, O hero, glory to You!
