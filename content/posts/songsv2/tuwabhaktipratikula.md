**TRANSLATION**

1) I vow to abandon without compromise all actions contrary to Your devotional service.

2) I will keep company with no one opposed to devotional service, nor even look at the face of a person inimical toward Lord Gauranga.

3) I shall never reside at a place unfavorable for devotional practices, and may I never take pleasure in non-devotional works.

4) I will read no book opposed to pure devotion, nor listen to any explanation which disagrees with pure devotional principles.

5) I will never regard as sacred any place where Lord Gauranga is rejected. Any knowledge hindering pure devotional service I consider worthless.

6) Any season which poses obstacles to the execution of devotional service shall find no favor with me, and I will consider all relatives or family members averse to pure devotion as strangers.

7) I will abandon all desires that hinder devotion and never accept food offered to me by non-devotee atheists.

8) I vow to promptly shun whatever I know to contradict pure devotion. This I strongly promise.

9) Bhaktivinoda, falling at the feet of the Lord, begs for the strength to give up all obstacles to pure devotion.
