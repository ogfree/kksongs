**LYRICS:**

(1)

śyāma abhisāre        calali sundarī dhanī

naba naba rańginī sāthe

bāma śrabana mūle        śata-dala pańkaja

kāma jaya phula-dhanu hāte

(2)

bhālahi sindūra       bhānu-kiraṇa ṣanu

taḿhi cāru candana-bindu

mukha heri lājame        sāyare lukāyala

dine dine kṣīṇa bhela indu

(3)

kari-rada-biracita         cāru bhūṣaṇa kare

madana jiniyā dhanī sāja

caraṇa-i nūpura          mukhara manohara

rati-jaya bājala bāja

(4)

lalitādi sakhī mili        mańgala hulāhuli

śyāma-daraśa-rasa-āśe

doḿhe doḿhā hera-ite          duhu cita pulakita

bāli hari gobinda-dāse

**TRANSLATION**

1) Accompanied by a young gopi\-friend, a beautiful girl goes to meet Krsna. A hundred-petal lotus flower decorates Her left ear. She defeats Kamadeva, who holds a bow of flowers in his hand.

2) She is decorated with red sindura. She is effulgent like the sun. She is gracefully marked with sandal-paste dots. Shyly she watches. She hides by a pond. She is slender like a crescent-moon grown more and more slender after many days.

3) She is graceful with ivory ornaments. She is so beautiful She defeats Kamadeva. Anklets adorn Her feet. Her face is enchanting. Her jingling ornaments defeat Rati.

4) She meets with Lalita and Her other friends. A joyful tumult arises. She yearns to taste the nectar of gazing on dark Krsna. She and Krsna gaze at each other. The hairs of Their bodies stand erect with joy. This Govinda dasa says.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is sung in Raga Tilaka Kamod.
