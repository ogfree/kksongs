**LYRICS:**

(1)

gora-guna ga\-o suni

bahu punya phale so pahum milala

prema parasamani

(2)

akhila jibera e soka sayara

nayana nimese sese

o-i prema lesa parasa na pa-ile

parana judabe kise

(3)

aruna nayane baruna alaya

karunaya nirikhane

madhura alape akhare akhare

sudha-dhara barisane

(4)

preme dhala dhala pulake purala

apada mastaka tanu

basudeba kahe sata dhara bahe

sumeru sincita tanu

**TRANSLATION**

1) I hear and sing of Lord Gaura's glories. After many pious deeds a soul may meet Lord Gaura, who is a parsamani jewel of spiritual love.

2) In an eye blink He dries up the sufferings of all fallen souls. How can a person who has not even a small fragment of love for Him bring cooling happiness to his own life

3) The glances from His reddish eyes are all oceans of mercy. Syllable by syllable, His sweet words are flooding monsoon showers of nectar.

4) He sheds tears of ecstatic spiritual love. From head to foot the hairs of His body stand erect in bliss. Vasudeva Ghosa says: He is like a golden Mount Meru where hundreds of flooding rivers flow.
