**TRANSLATION**

1) His glorious youthful handsomeness was beyond anything in this world. The splashing waves of his gentle smile would make even Kamadeva faint in bliss.

2) Who was that handsome boy? What happened to me when I saw Him? My peaceful composure fled far away. Now my heart is always agitated. Why do I always weep?

3) Smiling and smiling, and His limbs swaying to and fro, He danced and danced as He walked. From the corner of His eye He shot a fearsome sharp arrow, an arrow that pierced my life's breath.

4) Hanging from His neck, a jasmine garland swayed to and fro on His chest. Rising and falling, intoxicated black bees flew around and around its flowers.

5) Sandal-paste tilaka glistened on His forehead and chest. Why am I now so agitated? I do not know. My heart is wounded. Afraid of the people's gossip, I do not tell anyone.

6) The women and girls all have hard hearts. That is why I do not even go outside. Govinda dasa says: Who knows why this girl has become so changed? I do not know.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This is sung in Raga Sri.
