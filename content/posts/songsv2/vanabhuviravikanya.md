**TRANSLATION**

1) On the shore of the Yamuna in the Dvadasaditya forest filled with the humming bees in the middle of a courtyard of gold and jewels Sri Madana-Gopala is splendidly manifest.

2) Wearing a splendid new peacock-feather crown, charming necklaces, armlets, bracelets, rings, and tinkling anklets, and His transcendental form dressed in fine garments, anointed with saffron, and decorated with jasmine flowers, Sri Madana-Gopala is splendidly manifest.

3) Sweetly playing the flute He holds with both hands to His bimba fruit lips, His waist and knees bent, and His neck tilted, Sri Madana-Gopala is splendidly manifest.

4) The sweetness of His smiles and words maddening Radha's senses, and a single ray of the splendor of His face removing the blinding darkness of Her jealous anger and making useless the moon created by Brahma, Sri Madana-Gopala is splendidly manifest.

5) His crooked sidelong glances frightening the autumn lotus flowers and churning the depths of the milk-ocean of Radha's heart with the churning-rod of Mount Mandara, Sri Madana-Gopala is splendidly manifest.

6) The dancing of the crooked vines of His eyebrows gaining for Him the kindness of all jewellike, saintly girls, and His tilaka decorated forehead destroying the bow of Kama, Sri Madana-Gopala is splendidly manifest.

7) Maddened by the mystic mantra of coyly smiling Radha's words, and His nose, more handsome than the beak of a handsome young parrot, an ocean of splendor where the fish of the glances of saintly girls play, Sri Madana-Gopala is splendidly manifest.

8) Baiting with nectar the rope of the splendor of His teeth to capture the bumblebee of Radha's heart as it lands on the blossoming bandhuka flower of His lips to smell its sweetness, Sri Madana-Gopala is splendidly manifest.

9) Offering the honey of His splendid handsomeness in sacrifice to the bumblebees of the curling locks of hair on His forehead, and aiming the arrow of His sidelong glance at the bird of Radha's peaceful composure as it flies up to see the sweetness of His ears, Sri Madana-Gopala is splendidly manifest.

10) Assuming the role of a black bee drunk on the liquor of Radha's fragrant and splendid lotus face and searching Her cheeks, which defeat the mirrors, for the bimba fruits of Her lips, Sri Madana-Gopala is splendidly manifest.

11) The movements of His golden shark-shaped earrings making Radha forget all material duties, and His eyes meeting Her restless sidelong glance at His flute, Sri Madana-Gopala is splendidly manifest.

12) Placing on His neck more glorious than the sapphire conchshell and splendidly decorated with three lines, the king of jewels in order to embrace Sri Radha' reflected there, Sri Madana-Gopala is splendidly manifest.

13) His lotus chest a great bed for exhausted Radha to sleep on, and His transcendental arms Her excellent pillow, Sri Madana-Gopala is splendidly manifest.

14) His abdomen a charming leaf King Kama has, for the pleasure of the gopis, inscribed with his own names in the form of the wonderful line of hairs rising from the navel, Sri Madana-Gopala is splendidly manifest.

15) His glorious knees eclipsing a host of sapphires and His thighs the nectar posts established by Kamadeva to tightly bind the slowly-moving elephants of the young gopis' hearts, Sri Madana-Gopala is splendidly manifest.

16) His reddish lotus feet life for the senses of the intoxicated bumblebee Radha, whose only wish is to drink the new honey of love there, Sri Madana-Gopala is splendidly manifest.

17) The graceful motions of His peerless, splendid limbs making the glory of the handsomeness of millions of Kamadevas wilt, and a small fraction of His bodily strength destroying the arrogance of the greatest wild lions, Sri Madana-Gopala is splendidly manifest.

18) Like a splendid monsoon cloud, its shoulders and arms embraced by the lightning flashes of many amorous gopis as it moves along the Yamuna's shore, Sri Madana-Gopala is splendidly manifest.

19) Debating with the young gopis who studied the scriptures of Kamadeva Muni under the care of their teacher youth, Sri Madana-Gopala is splendidly manifest.

20) His arrogant demands eclipsed by the splendor of Radha's playful and delightful joking words, and His crooked, smiling glance pointed at Lalita's sharply intelligent face, Sri Madana-Gopala is splendidly manifest.

21) Happy to stay near Radha, a charming moon of love for His elder brother, never tiring of enjoying pastimes in the forest, and showering the nectar of love on the cakora birds of the people, Sri Madana-Gopala is splendidly manifest.

22) An intelligent person washed by the waters of humbleness, who abandons all love for material sense gratification, which only leads to Yamaraja, and reads this prayer glorifying Sri Madana-Gopala, birth after birth attains pure love for His lotus feet.
