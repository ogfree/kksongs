**TRANSLATION**

1) O Lord Krsna, when Your friends and relatives in the Yadu dynasty, who had fled their homes from fear of Kamsa, were brought before You, they respectfully worshipped You, and You returned them to their former residences.

2) O Lord Krsna, with Your continually smiling merciful glance, You delighted all the members of the Yadu dynasty. The nectar of the sight of You removes the influence of old-age and disease, which diminish the powers of the living entities. O Lord, all glories unto You.

3) O Lord Krsna, O best of the Satvata dynasty, O king of the Yadu dynasty, please be merciful to me. O Lord, O best of the Vrsnis, O monarch of the Dasarha dynasty, and descendant of the Madhu dynasty, please protect me.

4) O Lord Krsna, as the monarch of the Kukura and Andhaka dynasties, You caused the earth to flourish. You are the sun which nourishes the lotus flowers of King Yayati's family with it's rays, and You are the moon which has arisen in the ocean which is the dynasty descended from the moon-god.
