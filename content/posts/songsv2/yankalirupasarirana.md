**LYRICS:**

(1)

yań kali rūpa śarīra na dharata

tań vraja-prema-mahānidhi kuṭharīka, kon kapāṭa ughāḍata

(2)

nīra-kṣīra-haḿsana, pāna-vidhāyana, kon pṛthak kari pāyata

ko saba tyaji, bhaji’ vṛndāvana, ko saba grantha viracita

(3)

jaba pitu vana-phula, phalata nānā-vidha, manorāji aravinda

so madhukara vinu, pāna kon jānata, vidyamāna kari bandha

(4)

ko jānata, mathurā vṛndāvana, ko jānata vraja-nīta

ko jānata, rādhā-mādhava-rati, ko jānata soi prīta

(5)

jākara caraṇe, prasāde sakala jana, gāi gāoyāi sukha pāota

caraṇa-kamale, śaraṇāgata mādho, tava mahimā ura lāgata

**TRANSLATION**

1) If Rupa Gosvami had not appeared in Kali-yuga, who would have opened the great store-house of vraja-prema and distributed its contents freely?

2) Just as a swan separates milk from water, who could have separated the rasas to taste them? Abandoning everything, he performed bhajana in Vrndavana and wrote his rasika literatures.

3) When the yellow forest flowers blossom and fruits ripen, he lived like a bee taking the nectar from lotuses – who could have understood the nectar he was collecting?

4) Who could have understood Krsna’s lilas in Mathura and Vrndavana? How could we have known the sweet vraja-lilas and the love between Radha-Madhava?

5) By the mercy of his lotus feet, all can sing about and attain such divine bliss. The surrendered Madhava dasa is always praying to embrace Rupa’s glories.
