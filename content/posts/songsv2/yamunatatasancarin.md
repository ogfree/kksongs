yamunā\-taṭa-sañcārin kāliya\-hrada\-tīraga

**TRANSLATION**

1) O Krsna, moving along the bank of the Ymauna river, You went to the shore of the Kaliya lake. With Your nectarean glance, You restored the life of the cowherd boys and calves who had died because of Kaliya's poison. O Lord, I offer respectful obeisances unto You.

2) O Krsna, the cowherd boys could guess that You had restored their lives and they became amazed. In order to protect Your own devotees, You manifested Your transcendental prowess, which had previously been concealed. O Lord, all glories unto You.
