ore nīla jamunār jol

bol re more bol kothāy ghanaśyāma

bāje vṛndāvaner kon pathe tār

**TRANSLATION**

Refrain: Oh blue waters of the Yamuna River, tell me where did my dear monsoon-cloud-like beauty Krsna is present!

1) I have kept much hope in the heart, that I came to Vraja Dhama.

2) I have gone to the bank of the open forest and who did I see? My Krsna playing the flute, where I went to hear Srimati Radharani’s name.

3) I went to each home in Braja asking, “Where is Krsna?” Where are they not telling me where he is, and why are all eyes filled with tears?

4) Tell me, where is my beautiful Syama? Is he in Mathura? He must be in Gokula or Dwarka! He must be in Vrndavana playing the flute who is walking on the pathways resounding His anklebells that gives pleasure to all.
