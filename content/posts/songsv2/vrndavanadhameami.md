vṛndāvana dhāme āmi bose'āchi ekā

kṛpāmoyer ei kṛpā bujhilām kai?

**TRANSLATION**

1) I am sitting alone in the holy land of Vrndavana. In this mood, many realizations have been coming about.

2) I have my wife, sons, daughters, grandchildren, and everyone. Because I have no wealth, however, they consider me fruitless and without any opulence.

3) Sri Krsna has shown me material existence in its naked form. Because of the strength of Your mercy, I’ve become disguisted by it.

4) “To whom I show favor to, I will take away his wealth, gradually.” How will I understand the mercy of the merciful Lord?
