**LYRICS:**

(1)

\`ahaḿ mama’-śabda-arthe jāhā kichu hoy

arpiluń tomāra pade, ohe doyā-moy!

(2)

\`āmāra’ āmi to’ nātha! nā rohinu ār

ekhona hoinu āmi kevala tomār

(3)

\`āmi’ śabde dehī jīva ahaḿtā chāḍilo

twadīyābhimāna āji hṛdoye paśilo

(4)

āmār sarvasva—deho, geho anucar

bhāi, bandhu, dārā, suta, dravya, dwāra, ghar

(5)

se saba hoilo tava, āmi hoinu dās

tomāra gṛhete ebe āmi kori bās

tumi gṛha-swāmī, āmi sevaka tomār

tomāra sukhete ceṣṭā ekhona āmār

(7)

sthūla-lińga-dehe mora sukṛta duṣkṛta

āra mora nahe, prabhu! āmi to’ niṣkṛta

(8)

tomāra icchāya mora icchā miśāilo

bhakativinoda āja āpane bhulilo

**TRANSLATION:**

1-2) Whatever I am, whatever I possess, I offer at Your lotus feet, O merciful Lord. I no longer belong to myself. Now I am exclusively Yours.

3) The soul inhabiting this mortal body has given up the false ego attached to the word “I”, and now the eternal, spiritual sense of being Yours has entered his heart.

4-5) All my possessions - body, brothers, friends, and followers, wife, sons, personal belongings, house and home- all of these I give You, for I have become Your servant. Now I dwell in Your house.

6) You are the Lord of my house, and I Your most obedient servant. Your happiness is my only endeavor now.

7) Whatever piety or sins were done by me, by mind or deed, are no longer mine, for I am redeemed

8) My desire has become one with Yours. From this day Bhaktivinoda has no other identity.
