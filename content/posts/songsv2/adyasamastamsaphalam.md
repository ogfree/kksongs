**LYRICS:**

(refrain)

adya samastaḿ sa-phalaḿ jātam

śrī-rādhāyā vivahanam iha yac chrī-kṛṣṇena vibhātam

(1)

tasyā jananī-janaka-mahā-kulam api lokānāḿ sva-kulam

api sampat-kulam api līlākulam api sa-vayaḥ-kulam atulam

(2)

tatra bhāva-kulam api sańgati-kulam api virahāṇām

punar api sańgati-śubha-kulam api kulam avirata-sukha-nivahānām

(3)

śvaśru-śvaśura-sukhānvayam asyā gāsyāmaḥ sakhi kila kam

enām api pari pariṇayi jātaḿ tad idaḿ tat-kula-tilakam

**TRANSLATION**

Refrain: Today everything is fruitful. Today is the marriage of Sri Radha and Sri Krsna.

1) Her mother's and father's family are here. The families of all the people are here. Here are good fortune, wealth, transcendental pastimes, and Her peerless gopi friends.

2) Here are love, meeting, separation, auspicious reunion, and endless happiness.

3) How can I describe in song all the happiness Radha's marriage has brought to the king and queen of Vraja, who are now Her father-in-law and mother in-law? This marriage is a glorious tilaka mark for the family.
