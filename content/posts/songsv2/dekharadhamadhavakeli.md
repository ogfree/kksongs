**TRANSLATION**

1) Look! Radha and Krsna meet. They are Kamadeva's nectar pastimes personified.

2) His form is a dark monsoon cloud. She is waves of lightning.

3) He is an abode of sapphires. She is the purest gold.

4) He is the king of wild black bees. She is a lake of new lotus flowers.

5) He is a young tamala tree. She is a sweet golden-jasmine vine.

6) They are glorious like the sun and moon rising together. Gazing at Them, Govinda dasa is filled with wonder.

This song is sung in Raga Kedara.
