**LYRICS:**

(refrain)

(śrī) rāma kaho ghanaśyāma kaho

jaya bolo sītā rāma re

(terī) bīt rahī hai umariyā

jaya bolo ghanaśyāma re

(1)

madhura madhura jaga ke sapanoń meń

tune janama gańwāyā

kabhī na mana mandira meń pyāre

tune hari ko dhyāyā

dāńva lage nā pūrī lage

nā lāge cintām re

(2)

kadam kadam par pāp anekoń

tune nita hī kamāyā

kabhī nā sata-sańgata meń jāke

tune hari guṇa gāyā

jhūṭhī kāyā jhūṭhī māyā

kyūń tu bane g̣ulām re

(4)

hāńḍa māḿsa kā tana yeh terā

āj hai, kal nā rahe

hāthī ghoḍā mahala khazānā

koī sańga nā jāye

yeh tadaka bhanaka yeh camaka damaka

nā devegī kuch kāma re

(3)

ceta are māṭī ke putale

hai naśvar terī kāyā

cār dinoń kī zindagānī meń

tu kāhe bharamāyā

ab dhyāna karo gunagāna karo

lo rādhe śyāma ke nāma re

**TRANSLATION**

Refrain: Chant the name of Rama! Chant the name of Ghanasyama! Oh chant “all glories to Sita Rama!” Alas, Your life is passing by you, so chant the name of Ghanasyama!

1) You have wasted your birth dreaming of very sweet dreams of the world. Oh my dear one, you haven’t installed a temple in your heart and you haven’t worshipped Lord Hari! You take a constant gamble with your life, yet you have no worries about it!

2) At every step of yours, you have regularly accumulated many sins. You have not associated with devotees and sung the glories of Lord Hari! With a false body and false illusion surrounding you, why have you become a slave to this?

3) The bones and flesh of your body is here today, but won’t exist tomorrow. Your elephants, horses, palace, and wealth will not accompany you after death. This momentary hint of shine and glamour will not serve any purpose to you.

4) O soul! Your body that is made of doll made of the elements of this earth is mortal. In this very short lifespan, why are you bewildering? At least now, mediate, chant the glories and the qualities, and take the name of Radhe Syama!
