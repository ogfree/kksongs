(refrain)

harine bhajatāń haju koī nī lāj jatā nathī jāṇī re

jenī suratā śyāmaḷiyā sāth vade vedavāṇī re

(1)

vahāle ugāyoń prahalāda haraṇākaśipu māryo re

vibhīṣaṇa ne āpyuń rājya rāvaṇa saḿhāryo re

(2)

vahāle narasi mahetā ne hār hātho-hātha āpyo re

dhruva ne āpyuń avicaḷa rāja potāno karī thāpyo re

(3)

vahāle mīrā te bāī nā jhera haḷāhaḷa pīdhāń re

pāñcāḷī nāń pūryoń cīra pāṇḍava kāma kīdhā re

(4)

āvo hari bhajavāno lahāvo bhajan koī karaśe re

kara joḍa kahe premaḷa dāsa bhaktoń nāń duḥkha haraśe re

**TRANSLATION**

Refrain: Remembering and worshipping Lord Hari has been proven not to take away one’s modesty. Who ever is protected by Syama’s lotus-like face is considered a scholar of the Vedas.

1) To honor Prahlada Maharaja, You have come as Nrsimha to kill Hiranyakasipu. To honor Vibhisana, You have given him the duty of a king and killed Ravana to end demoniac rule in Lanka during Your incarnation as Lord Ramacandra.

2) To honor Gujarati devotee Narasi Mehta, You came personally to meet him and hold his hand. To honor Dhruva Maharaja, You had given him the duty to be a Krsna Conscious ruler and thus established him in this way.

3) To honor Mira Bai, You transformed the poison given by her husband into nectar. To honor Draupadi, You extended Yourself as extra cloth to protect Draupadi and thus, help the Pandavas achieve their goal in the long run.

4) Come! Let us worship Lord Hari together. Premala Dasa folds his two hands to Lord Hari, the Lord who removes the sufferings of His devotees.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is sung in Raga Gauri in Dipacandi tala.
