sundara śyāmara ańga

rańga paṭāmbara          hāra manohara

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) Dark-limbed Krsna is handsome and charming. His garments and necklace are glorious. His limbs covered with dust raised by the cows' hooves, He charms every heart.

1)  He leads the cows back to Vraja Village. His friends return to their own homes. He ties the calves. Tying the cows, again and again He draws milk from them.

2) He is decorated with new new leaves. On His head is a peacock feather and a ring of flowers. His shark-shaped jewel earrings swing to and fro. Gazing at Him, how many Kamadevas are overcome with wonder?

3) His chest is glorious with a forest-flower garland. His anklets and belt jangle. Govinda dasa's master charms the hearts of the entire world. He delights Vraja's teenage girls.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is sung in Raga Todi.
