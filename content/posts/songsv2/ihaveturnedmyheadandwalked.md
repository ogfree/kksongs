**LYRICS:**

(1)

I have turned my head and walked the other way for so long now

Isn’t it about time I turned to you?

I’ve been searching for something, someone to trust and to believe in

Isn’t it about time I returned to you?

I’ve been running here and there, trying to find pure love somewhere

Oh, what I found has slipped through my hands

(2)

Now within my heart within the very start I’ve feeling so secure

Oh, the sunny lotus smile runs through my eyes

Dancing cascades of waterfalls of love are falling down, calling me again to look to You

Soothing moon beams of peacefulness, harmony are over me.

Reminding that pure love will never end

Lord Krsna, You are the eternal friend

(3)

Throughout life, I felt everything I’ve done is soaked in sin

Hoping what I found won’t fade away

Now, everything I have received, I want to give it all to Thee

Please help me understand You more each day

Dancing cascades of waterfalls of love are falling down, calling me again to look to You

Soothing moon beams of peacefulness, harmony are over me.

Reminding that pure love will never end

Lord Krsna, You are the eternal friend
