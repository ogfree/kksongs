**TRANSLATION**

1) The dead boy continued, "Thus I have been captured and bound by maya. Due to being tied tightly by her ropes of ignorance and bewilderment, I have undergone many, many births since that time, simply wandering here and there in the ghastly darkness of maya's illusions."

2) "Sometime I become a demigod, sometimes a demon, and sometimes I get the body of a man, an animal, a bird or an insect. Sometimes I wander up to heaven, sometimes down to hell, and sometimes on earth, being carried away the whole time by innumerable materialistic hopes and aspirations."

3) " I have no idea of what kind of wonderful pious credit I have earned to be born here in this life as the son of Sri Srivasa Pandita within the holy abode of Navadvipa. Thus I myself am amazed that I have had the great fortune of actually being able to see and touch Your lotus feet, oh Lord."

4) "Usually, whenever I have to die, I always experience great pain and distress upon leaving the particular body I happen to be in. But this time, I am only experiencing great happiness by discussing all these topics related to Your glories. However, my time is now up, so I must take Your leave."

5) "If it is Your desire that I should take another birth, oh Lord, I pray and humbly request Your Lordship to kindly allow me to be always situated in the transcendental loving service of Your divine lotus feet."

6) Saying this, the boy then fell silent. Seeing this wonderful pastime of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, Srivasa Pandita's whole family gave up all of their lamentation and became absorbed in great transcendental happiness.

7) Thus the transcendental character and activities of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu are just like a continuous shower of ambrosia. Bhaktivinoda is thereby losing his vital life force simply begging Srivasa Thakura to allow him to drink more of this nectarean ambrosia.
