sri-bhagavan kahilen:

vedavani karmakandi samsara asraye

nana yoni prapta hay kabhu mukta nay

samsara ye vrksa sei asvattha avyay

urdhvamula adhah-sakha nahi tar ksay

puspita vedera chanda se brahmera patra

mohita se veda-vakya jagata sarvatra

(2)

vrksera se sakhali urdhva adhah-gati

gunera vasete yar yatha vidhi-mati

se vrksera sakha yata visayera bhog

nija karma anusare yata bhava-rog

baddha-jiva ghure sei vrksa dale dale

manusya-loka se bhunje nija karmaphale

(3-4)

ksudra-buddhi manusya se sima nahi pay

ananta akase tar adi anta nay

kiva rupa se vrksera taha nahi bujhe

ananta kalera madhye jiv yuddha yujhe

se asvattha vrksa hay sudrdha ye mul

se mul katite hay sata sata bhul

anasakti ek astra se mul katite

sei se ye drdha astra samsara jinite

katiya se vrksa-mul satyera sandhan

bhagya-krame yar hay tate avasthan

se yay vaikuntha-loke phire nahi ase

e vrksera mul yatha se purusa pase

se adi puruse adya kara ye prapatti

janmadi se yaha hate prakrti pravrtti

(5)

nirabhiman nirmoha sangadose mukta

nityanitya buddhi yar kamana nivrtta

sukha duhkha dvandva mukta jada mudha nay

vidhijna purusa pay se pada avyay

(6)

se akase jyotirmaye surya va sasanka

avasyak nahi tatha kimba se pavaka

sekhane praves hale phire nahi ase

nitya-kal mor dhame se jana nivase

(7)

yata jiv mor amsa nahe se apar

sanatan tar satta jivaloke ghor

ekhane se man ar indriya-vandhane

karsana karaye kata prakrtir sthane

(8)

bar bar kata deha se ye prapta hay

ek deha chade ar anye pravesay

vayu gandha yatha yay sthan sthanantare

karma-phal suksma sei deha dehantare

(9)

sarirera anusar sravana darsan

sparsana, rasana ar ghran va manan

se sarire jiva kare visay sevan

baddha-jiva kare sei samsara bhraman

(10)

mudhaloka na vicare ki bhave ki hay

utkranti sthiti bhog kar va kothay

yar jnana-caksu ache gurura krpay

bhagyavan sei jan dekhivare pay

(11)

kata yogi vaijnanik cesta vahu kare

atmajnan abhavete vrtha ghuri mare

kintu yeva atmajnani atmavasthita

dekhite samartha hay suddha avahita

(12)

ei ye suryera tej akhila jagate

candrera kirana kimba ache bhala\-mate

amara prabhava sei abhasa se hay

ami yake alo di-i se alo pay

(13)

ei ye prthivi yatha vayu-madhye bhase

amara se sakti dhare savete pravese

ami se ousadhi yata posana karite

candra-rupe rasmi-dan kari se tahate

(14)

ami vaisvanara hai dehamatra vasi

pranapan vayuyoge bhaksya dravya kasi

(15)

sabara hrdaye ami, sannivista antaryami,

ama hate smrti jnan man

ami se jagai kare,ami se bhulai tare,

ama hate hay apohan

yata veda prthivite,amara se tallasete,

ami hai saba vedavedya

ami se vedanta-vit,ami ye vedanta-krt,

vedantera katha suna adya

(16)

vaddha mukta purusa se hay dvi-prakar

dui name paricita se ksara aksar

vaddha jiv yata hay tar ksara nam

aksara kutastha jiv nitya mukta-dham

(17)

taha hate ye uttam purusa pradhan

isvara se paramatma thake sarvasthan

(18)

ksara va aksara hate ami se uttam

ataev ghosita nam purusottam

(19)

ye more bujhila srestha se purusottama

sakala sandeha chadi haila uttama

se janila sarva veda nirmala hrday

he bharat! sarvabhave se more bhajay

(20)

ei se sastrera gudha marma katha suna

tumi se nispapa hao suddha tava man

iha ye bujhila bhagye hala buddhiman

he bharat! krta-krtya se hala mahan

(21)

bhaktivedanta kahe sri-gitara gan

sune yadi suddha bhakta krsnagata-pran

**TRANSLATION**

1) The Blessed Lord said: There is a banyan tree which has its roots upward and its branches down and whose leaves are the Vedic hymns. One who knows this tree is the knower of the Vedas.

2) The branches of this tree extend downward and upward, nourished by the three modes of material nature. The twigs are the objects of the senses. This tree also has roots going down, and these are bound to the fruitive actions of human society.

3-4) The real form of this tree cannot be perceived in this world. No one can understand where it ends, where it begins, or where its foundation is. But with determination one must cut down this tree with the weapon of detachment. So doing, one must seek that place from which, having once gone, one never returns, and there surrender to that Supreme Personality of Godhead from whom everything has began and in whom everything is abiding since time immemorial.

5) One who is free from illusion, false prestige, and false association, who understands the eternal, who is done with material lust and is freed from the duality of happiness and distress, and who knows how to surrender unto the Supreme Person, attains to that eternal kingdom.

6) That abode of Mine is not illumined by the sun or moon, nor by electricity. One who reaches it never returns to this material world.

7) The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental parts. Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind.

8) The living entity in the material world carries his different conceptions of life from one body to another as the air carries aromas.

9) The living entity, thus taking another gross body, obtains a certain type of ear, tongue, and nose and sense of touch, which are grouped about the mind. He thus enjoys a particular set of sense objects.

10) The foolish cannot understand how a living entity can quit his body, nor can they understand what sort of body he enjoys under the spell of the modes of nature. But one whose eyes are trained in knowledge can see all this.

11) The endeavoring transcendentalist, who is situated in self-realization, can see all this clearly. But those who are not situated in self-realization cannot see what is taking place, though they may try to.

12) The splendor of the sun, which dissipates the darkness of this whole world, comes from Me. And the splendor of the moon and the splendor of fire are also from Me.

13) I enter into each planet, and by My energy they stay in orbit. I become the moon and thereby supply the juice of life to all vegetables.

14) I am the fire of digestion in every living body, and I am the air of life, outgoing and incoming, by which I digest the four kinds of foodstuff.

15) I am seated in everyone's heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness. By all the Vedas I am to be known; indeed I am the compiler of Vedanta, and I am the knower of the Vedas.

16) There are two classes of beings, the fallible and the infallible. In the material world every entity is fallible, and in the spiritual world every entity is called infallible.

17) Besides these two, there is the greatest living personality, the Lord Himself, who has entered into these worlds and is maintaining them.

18) Because I am transcendental, beyond both the fallible and the infallible, and because I am the greatest, I am celebrated both in the world and in the Vedas as that Supreme Person.

19) Whoever knows Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, without doubting, is to be understood as the knower of everything, and He therefore engages himself in full devotional service, O son of Bharata.

20) This is the most confidential part of the Vedic scriptures, O sinless one, and it is disclosed now by Me. Whoever understands this will become wise, and his endeavors will know perfection.

21) Thus Bhaktivedanta sings the song of Sri Gita, with the hope that hearing this, Krsna conscious pure devotees will be pleased.
