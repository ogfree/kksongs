**LYRICS**

(1)

nātha hare jagannātha hari

sīdati rādhā'vāsa-gṛhe

(2)

paśyati diśi diśi rahasi bhavantam

tad-adhara-madhura-madhūni pibantam

(3)

śrī-jayadeva-kaver idam uditam

rasika-janaḿ tanutām atimuditam

**TRANSLATION**

1) O my master, Hari! O Lord of the Universe, Hari! Srimati Radharani is in Her hiding spot woefully awaiting for you.

2) While She is alone, She fantasies that You are everywhere She sees. You sip the honey from Her lips, as if She was actually there.

3) The poem of Jayadeva Goswami describes the loving exchange between Radha and Krsna. May this poem be enjoyed by the devotees of rasika bhava.
