(1)

nivedana kori prabhu! tomāra caraṇe

patita adhama āmi, jāne tri-bhuvane

(2)

āmā-sama pāpī nāhi jagat-bhitore

mama sama aparādhī nāhiko saḿsāre

(3)

sei saba pāpa āra aparādha, āmi

parihāre pāi lajjā, saba jāno’ tumi

(4)

tumi binā kā’ra āmi loibo śaraṇ?

tumi sarveśvareśvara, brajendra-nandan!

(5)

jagat tomāra nātha! tumi sarva-moy

tomā prati aparādha tumi koro’ kṣoy

(6)

tumi to’ skhalita-pada janera āśroy

tumi binā āra kibā āche, doyā-moy!

(7)

sei-rūpa tava aparādhī jana jata

tomāra śaraṇāgata hoibe satata

(8)

bhakativinoda ebe loiyā śaraṇ

tuwā pade kore āj ātma-samarpaṇ

**TRANSLATION**

1) I submit at Your lotus feet, O Lord, that I am fallen and wretched, a fact known to the three worlds.

2) There is no sinner more sinful than me. In the entire material creation there is no offender whose offenses equal mine.

3) By attempting to clear myself of all these sins and offenses I am put to shame and beg Your forgiveness. All this is understood by You.

4) Of whom will I take shelter except for You? O son of the King of Vraja, You are the Lord of all lords.

5) This world is Yours, and You pervade all things in it. You forgive the offenses committed against You.

6) You alone are the shelter of those who have gone astray. Apart from You, what else exists, O merciful Lord?

7) Those like me who have offended You will know no peace until achieving Your shelter.

8) Bhaktivinoda takes shelter in You and surrenders himself at Your lotus feet on this very day.
