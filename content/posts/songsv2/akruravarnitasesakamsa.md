**TRANSLATION**

1) O Lord Krsna, when Akrura described Kamsa's demoniac plans, You became greatly angry. You became distressed when You heard of the sufferings of Devaki, Vasudeva, and the others.

2) O Lord Krsna, You asked Nanda Maharaja, the king of the cowherd men, to travel to Mathura. When the residents of Gokula heard that Krsna was about to travel to Mathura\-city, in the morning they became agitated with distress.

3) O Lord Krsna, this news caused a hundred fears and anxieties to flame up within Mother Yasoda's heart, this news caused all the gopis of Vraja to fall into the ocean of suffering. O Lord, please protect me.

4) O Lord Krsna, the gopis burned with distress and they considered that the entire universe had become void and empty. They caused the waters of the Yamuna to swell with the flowing streams of their tears.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is based on Srimad Bhagavatam Canto 10 Chapter 39.
