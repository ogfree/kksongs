**TRANSLATION**

1) Early in the morning Jatila-devi met Sri Radha' and Her friend Lalita. Jatila noticed that Radha was wearing a yellow garment on Her breasts, Her eyes were rolling in sleepiness, and Her bimba fruit lips were deeply cut, as if someone had bit them. Although frightened at heart, Radha' externally assumed an angry pose, became furious at Jatila's insinuations, and together with Lalita, in order to defend Herself, fabricated a network of seemingly logical lies. Afterward She glorified Lalita for her skillful help. May Sri Radha' protect you all.

2) I pray that I may fan the two young dancers of Vraja who have become fatigued by happily dancing in Cupid's arena in an incomparable forest grove filled with the instrumental muse of the expert cuckoos and the humming songs of the bees.

3) I pray that Visakha-devi, whose voice is sweeter than the cuckoos, may teach me the art of beautiful singing. I pray that by singing during the rasa dance I will please the youthful divine couple and I will obtain from Them and Their associates many necklaces of gold and jewels as my reward.

4) I meditate on the smiling prince of Vraja, whose splendid dark complexion rebukes a host of monsoon clouds, whose garments are like molten gold, whose lotus face is charming with a gentle smile, whose transcendental body is expertly decorated, and who speaks many clever joking words as, maddened with playful amorous passion, He embraces Srimati Radhika' to His left.
