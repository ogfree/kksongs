**LYRICS:**

(1)

yoga-pīṭhopari-sthita,  aṣṭa-sakhī-suveṣṭita,

bṛndāraṇye kadamba-kānane

rādhā-saha vaḿśī-dhārī,  viśva-jana-citta-hārī,

prāṇa mor tāńhāra caraṇe

(2)

sakhī-ājñā-mata kori dońhāra sevan

pālya-dāsī sadā bhāvi dońhāra caraṇ

(3)

kabhu kṛpā kori,  mama hasta dhori’,

madhura vacana bole

tāmbūla loiyā,  khāy dui jane,

mālā loya kutūhale

(4)

adarśana hoy kakhon ki chale

nā dekhiyā dońhe hiyā jwale

(5)

jekhāne sekhāne,  thākuka du’jane,

āmi to’ caraṇa-dāsī

milane ānanda,  virahe jātanā,

sakala samāna bāsi

(6)

rādhā-kṛṣṇa prāṇa mor jīvane maraṇe

more rākhi’ māri’ sukhe thākuka du’jane

(7)

bhakativinoda,  āna nāhi jāne,

poḍi’ nija-sakhī-pāy

rādhikāra gaṇe,  thākiyā satata,

yugala-caraṇa cāy

**TRANSLATION**

1) Situated upon the Yoga-Pitha surrounded by the eight chief gopis in a kadamba tree grove within Vrndavana with His beloved Radha is the holder of the flute the stealer of the hearts of all living beings in the universe-I lay down my life at Their lotus feet.

2) According to the directions of my superior sakhi, I render service to the Divine Couple. I always consider myself a dependent maidservant of the lotus feet of the Divine Couple.

3) Sometimes, out of great mercy, my sakhi holds my hand and speaks sweet words to me. Taking the betel nuts I have prepared she offers them to those two persons and accepts flower garlands for Them in great delight.

4) By some deception They periodically disappear from my sight. Not seeing the Divine Couple of Vraja, my heart burns in agony.

5) Wherever those two may be I am certainly a humble maidservant of Their lotus feet. I consider the ecstasies of meeting Them and the agonies of separation from Them to be exactly the same.

6) In life or death, Radha and Krsna are my life and soul. May They always be happy, whether They choose to protect me or kill me.

7) This Bhaktivinoda knows nothing beyond this. Falling down at the lotus feet of the sakhi whom he serves and always remaining among the associates of Sri Radhika he prays for the lotus feet of the Divine Couple of Vraja.

Thus ends Gitavali by Srila Saccidananda Bhaktivinoda Thakura

**Ending Prema-Dhvani**

nṛtya-gīta-samāpti-kāle

jaya śrī godruma-candra gorā-cāńda kī jaya

jaya prema-dātā śrī nityānanda kī jaya!

jaya śrī śāntipura-nātha kī jaya!

jaya śrī gadādhara paṇḍita goswāmī kī jaya!

jaya śrī śrīvāsādi bhakta-vṛnda kī jaya!

jaya śrī navadvīpa-dhāma kī jaya!

jaya śrī nāma-haṭṭa kī jaya!

jaya śrī śrotṛ-varga kī jaya!

śrī śrī nām haṭṭera parimārjjaka jhāḍudār

dīna-hīna śrī kedāranāth bhaktivinoda

**TRANSLATION:**

When the dancing and chanting is concluded:

All glories to the moon of Godruma, Gauracanda!

All glories to the giver of divine love, Sri Nityananda!

All glories to the Lord of Santipura!

All glories to Sri Gadadhara Pandita Gosvami!

All glories to Srivasa Pandita and the assembly of devotees!

All glories to the divine abode of Navadvipa!

All glories to the Marketplace of the Holy Name!

All glories to the listeners of the Holy Name!

Signed, the cleaner and sweeper of the Marketplace of the Holy Name, the lowly and destitute Sri Kedaranath Bhaktivinoda.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**
