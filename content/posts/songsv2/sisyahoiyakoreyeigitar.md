**LYRICS:**

(1)

śiṣya hoiyā kore yei gitāra śravaṇa

ghucibe ajñāna āra saḿsāra bandhana

(2)

saḿsāra ghucilo kintu bāhya nyāsī noy

gitār tātparye gṛhī e rūpa bujhāy

(3)

“kariṣye vacanaḿ tava” sei mantra siddhi

ataeva yuddhe tāńra ho’lo yaśo-vṛddhi

(4)

vaiṣṇava nirīha saba mālā japa kore

e kon vaiṣṇava arjuna saḿsāra bhitore

**TRANSLATION**

1) Becoming a disciple, Arjuna listened to the Bhagavad-gita. All his ignorance dissipated as well as his material bondage.

2) His material bondage was cut, but he was not dressed as a sannyasi. The householders understand the Gita's meaning this way.

3) The perfection of mantras was “I will do what you say.” Therefore, the war that he fought brought him an increase in fame.

4) Vaisnavas have no desires. They all chant on beads. What kind of Vaisnava is Arjuna in the middle of the material world?
