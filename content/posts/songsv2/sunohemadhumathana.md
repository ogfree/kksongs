**LYRICS:**

(1)

hari he

śuno he madhu-mathana      mama eka bijñāpana

biśeṣa koriyā boli āmi

tomāra sebātwa mama      swakiyā baibhabottama

āmi dāsa tumi mora swāmī

(2)

se-baibhaba-bahirbhūta        hoite hoile he acyuta

khaṇa-mātra sahite nā pāri

deho prāṇa sukha āśā          ātma prati bhalābāsa

sarba-tyāga korite bicāri

(3)

e saba jāuka nāśa        śata-bāra śrīnibāsa

tabu thāku dāsatwa tomāra

e bhaktibinoda koya      kṛṣṇa-dāsa jība hoya

dāsya binā kiba āche āra

**TRANSLATION**

1) Oh my dear Lord Hari! Please hear me now, oh Lord Who gives honey to those who You trample upon! I am revealing this specific confession unto You. The topmost wealth of my own ultimate service attitude is this... I am Your servant, and You are my Master.

2) Oh Acyuta, infallible Lord! I am not able to tolerate even a split second of life outside the purview of this divine wealth of Your eternal service. Therefore I have now decided to renounce everything that is near and dear to the illusioned soul such as the body, the life, material pleasures as well as all hopes for future sense gratification.

3) Oh Residence of the Goddess of Fortune! Let all these things be neglected by me and fall into abject ruination hundreds of times; I don't mind, for I will still remain immutably fixed in Your eternal service. Bhaktivinoda says that the soul is irrevocably the eternal servant of Krsna and except for this eternal service there is no other reality.
