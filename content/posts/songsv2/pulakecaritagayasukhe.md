**LYRICS:**

(1)

pulake carita gaya  sukhe gadagadi yaya

dekha re caitanya abatara

baikuntha-nayaka hari  dwija-rupe abatari

sankirtane karena bihara

(2)

kanaka jiniya kanti sri-bigraha sobha bhanti

a-janu-lambita bhuja saje

sannyasira rupa dhari  apana rasa bihwala

na jani kemana sukhe nace

(3)

jaya sri-gaurasundara  karunara sindhu-maya

jaya brndabana-raya re

nabadwipe purandara  brndabana pamare

carana-kamale deha chaya re

**TRANSLATION**

1) Please gaze, O, at Caitanya-avatara. As He sings, the hairs of His body stand erect. Overcome with ecstasy, He rolls on the ground. He is Lord Krsna, the king of Vaikuntha. To this world descending in the form of a brahmana, He enjoys pastimes of sankirtana.

2) His form is graceful and glorious. His complexion defeats gold. His long arms reach to His knees. Manifesting the form of a sannyasi, He is overcome by tasting the nectar of love for a person who is actually Himself. How does He dance in such ecstasy? I do not know.

3) O Sri Gaurasundara, O ocean of mercy, glory to You! O king of Vrndavana, glory to You! O king of Navadvipa, please give the shade of Your lotus feet to this wicked Vrndavana dasa.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is rendered in Raga Sri.
