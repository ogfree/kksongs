**LYRICS:**

(1)

paramānanda he mādhava

pādungalucī makarāṇḍa

(2)

se-makarāṇḍa pana-kari

ānande bolo 'hari hari'

harińka nāme vandha vela

pari karive caka-dola

(4)

se-caka-dolāńka-pāyāre

mana-mo rahu nirantare

mana mo nirantare rahū

'hā-kṛṣṇa' boli jivā jāu

mote udhāra rādhā-dhava

**TRANSLATION**

1) O supremely blissful Madhava! The nectar is coming from Your lotus feet.

2) Drinking that nectar, I blissfully sing “Hari! Hari!”

3) With the name of Hari, I am binding a raft on which Lord Jagannatha will ferry me across this ocean of material existence.

4) My mind always remains at the lotus feet of that Lord Jagannatha who has very large round eyes.

5) In this way, I call out "Ha Krishna!" and give up my life. O husband of Radharani, please deliver me.
