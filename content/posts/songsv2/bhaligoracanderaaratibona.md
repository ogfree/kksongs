(1)

bhāli gorācandera āratiboni

bāje sańkīrtanera madhura rasa dhvani

śańkha bāje, ghaṇṭā bāje, bāje karatāla

vividha kusuma phule gole vanamālā

koto koṭī candra jini vadana ujjvalā

vīra vallabha dāsa śrī gaura caraṇe āśa

jagabhari rahalo mahimā prakāśa

**TRANSLATION**

1) How beautiful is the evening-arati of Goracanda! The sankirtana resounds sweetly and tastefully.

2) Conch shells resound, bells ring and kartalas clang. Sweet mridangas pound and all this sounds very tasteful.

3) Around His neck Gora wears a garland of different kinds of forestflowers and His face shines brighter than millions of moons.

4) Brahma and other demigods stand there with folded hands and the thousand headed Sesa holds a jeweled umbrella over His head.

5) Siva, Suka and Narada are considering that nothing higher than this can be found in the Vedas, and thus they become absorbed in ecstasy.

6) Srinivasa and Haridasa are singing auspicious songs while Narahari and Gadadhara are wielding yak tail fans.

7) Vira-vallabha Dasa yearns for Sri Gaura’s lotus feet and the whole world is filled with the manifestation of His glories.

**Remarks/ Extra Information****:**

In the 1970 “Radha Krsna Temple” album, the Gaura Arotik track incorrectly used verse 2 of this song in place of verse 5 of Bhaktivinoda Thakura’s song. There were many errors in the song in that track.
