**LYRICS:**

(Refrain)

pekhalu gauracandra naṭa-rāja

jańgama hema        dharādhara uyala

kiye nabadwīpa-mājha

(1)

pada\-tale bhakata          kalpa-taru siñcita

prema-rasa makaranda

yākara chāyāra      sosara naba naba

paramānanda niradanda

(2)

naba nīrada jini      kata mandākinī

tri-bhubana bharala tarańga

nityānandacandra         abhirāma dinamaṇi

bhrama-i pradakṣiṇa rańge

(3)

yākara caraṇa         samādhaye śańkara

caturānana karu āśe

se pahu patita        kore dhari kānda-i

ki kahaba gobinda-dāse

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) I saw Lord Gauracandra, the king of dancers! How has He become so like a golden mountain walking in the midst of Navadvipa?

1) He is a kalpa-taru tree that sprinkles the honey of ecstatic spiritual love on the devotees that approach His feet. The shade of that tree brings newer and newer bliss and peace.

2) The waves of His tears flood the three worlds. How many celestial Gangas are they like? How many rain-pouring clouds are they like? Lord Nityanandacandra and Abhirama Thakura are like two suns that circle around Him in the dancing-arena.

3) Rapt in samadhi, Siva meditates on His feet. Brahma yearns to attain Him. Hugging a fallen soul, Lord Gaurancandra weeps. What more need Govinda dasa say?

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is sung in Raga Basanta.
