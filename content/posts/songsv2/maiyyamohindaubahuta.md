**LYRICS:**

(refrain)

maiyā, mohiń dāū bahuta khijhāyau

mosoń kahata mola kau linahauń, tū jasumati kaba jāyau

(1)

kahā kahauń ihiń risa ke māre khelata hauń nahi jāta

puni-puni kahata kauna hai mātā, ko hai tero tāta

(2)

gore nanda, jasodā gorī, tū kata syāma sarīra

chuṭakī dai dai hańsata gvāla saba, sikhai deta balabīra

(3)

tū mohīń koń mārana sīkhī, dāuhiń kabahuń na khījhai

mohana-mukha risa kī ye bāteń, jasumati suni-suni rījhai

(4)

sunahu kānha, balabhadra chabāī, janamata hī kau dhūta

sūra shyāma mohiń godhana kī sauń, hauń mātā, tū pūta

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain): “Oh my dear mother! My elder brother teases me as such. He asks Me in mirth, ‘Were you purchased or did Mother Yasoda really give birth to You?’”

1) “He is such a big brother that I cannot play with. He keeps asking Me, ‘who is Your mother and who is Your father?’”

2) “‘Nanda Maharaja is fair skinned. Mother Yasoda is also fair skinned. How did you become so dark?’ My cowherd friends and Balarama laugh at Me and tease Me, because it is a joke for them.”

3) “You always scold Me very harshly and Elder Brother gets away scot-free!” Hearing His enchanting son speak like this, Mother Yasoda smiled.

4) Mother Yasoda said, “O Kana! Please pay no attention to Balarama. He likes to have fun and is mischievous. I swear upon the mother cow: O Syama, the beloved Lord of Sura Dasa, I am Your mother and You are my son!”
