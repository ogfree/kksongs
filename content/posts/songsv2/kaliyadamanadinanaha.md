**LYRICS:**

(Refrain)

kāliya-damana dīna-nāha

kālindī-kūla kadamba chāha

(1)

kata kata braja naba bālā

pekhalu janu thira bijarīka mālā

(2)

tohe kaho subala sāńgāti

tabadhari hāma nā jāni dibā rāti

(3)

tahi dhani maṇi du-i cāri

tahi mano-mohinī eka nārī

(4)

so rahu majhu mane paṭhi

manasija dhūme ghuma nāhi diṭhi

(5)

anukhaṇa tahita samādhi

ko jāne kaichana biraha-biyādhi

(6)

dine dine kṣīṇa bhela dehā

gobinda-dāsa kaha aiche naba-lehā

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) Krsna, who is the Lord of the poor and meek and the hero that vanquished Kaliya, stays in a kadamba tree's shade on the Yamuna's banks.

1) (Lord Krsna says:) How many girls of Vraja have I seen? Still, this one girl is splendid like a garland of unmoving lightning flashes,

2) O friend Subala, I tell you: from that moment I no longer know whether it is day or night.

3) In that place were two or four beautiful girls splendid like glistening jewels. But only one of those girls cast a spell on My heart.

4) I keep that girl in my heart. My heart is filled with the smoke of Kamadeva's flames. Lost in the smoke, I cannot see the directions.

5) Moment after moment I am rapt in thinking of this girl. I know nothing but Her. I am overcome by the fever of separation from Her.

6) Day after day my body becomes more thin and emaciated. Govinda dasa says: These are the signs of new love.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is sung in Raga Gandhara.
