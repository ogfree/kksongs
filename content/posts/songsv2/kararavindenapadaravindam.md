**TRANSLATION**

1) I meditate on that infant Mukunda (Krsna) who is sleeping on the leaf of a banyan tree with his the lotus like foot placed in his lotus like mouth with his lotus like hand.

2) I meditate on that infant Mukunda who is sleeping holding all the worlds together on the leaf of a banyan tree in such form, which has no beginning or no end.  He is the incarnation of God for the welfare of all mankind and the Lord of all.

3) I meditate on Bala Mukunda in my heart, who has a delicate body like a blue lotus and whose foot is worshipped by all the gods and Indra etc. He is the wish-fulfilling tree for those who take refuge in him.

4) I meditate on that Bala Mukunda in my heart, who has hanging curls and hanging necklaces, a beautiful row of teeth which are shown playfully. His lower lip is as red as a Bimba fruit and has beautiful wide eyes.

5) I meditate on that Bala Mukunda in my heart, who pretended as if he was sleeping, having eaten the yogurt to his contentment from the hanging pots of the Gopis when they had gone out.

6) I meditate on Bala Mukunda whose beautiful face resembles the autumnal moon and is dancing happily on the hood of the serpent Kaliya holding its tail with his hand in the Kalinda pond.

7) I meditate on Bala Mukunda with beautiful eyes like the petals of a full- bloomed lotus and who with great valor broke the pair of tall yamala-arjuna trees even though he was tied to a mortar (a large heavy stone bowl for pounding  grain).

8) I meditate on Bala Mukunda, God filled with sat and cit, i.e., infinite consciousness, of infinite divine form, the lotus eyed one who cast his looks at his mother’s face with affection, while drinking milk from her breast.
