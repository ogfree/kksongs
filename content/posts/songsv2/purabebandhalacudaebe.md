**LYRICS:**

(1)

purabe bandhala cuda ebe kesa-hina

nata-bara-besa chadi parila kaupina

(2)

gabhi dohana bhanda chila bama kare

karanga dharila gora se-i anusare

(3)

tretaya dharila dhanu dvaparete bamsi

kali-yuge danda dhari ha-ila sannyasi

(4)

balarama kahe suna nadiya-nibasi

balarama abadhuta kana-i sannyasi

**TRANSLATION**

1) Formerly His hair was bound in a topknot. Now He has no hair. Rejecting His colorful garments of a dancing actor, now He wears a sannyasi’s kaupina.

2) Formerly He carried a pot for milking cows. Now He carries a sannyasi’s waterpot. Now His complexion is fair.

3) In Treta-yuga He carried an archer’s bow (in the form of Sri Rama). In Dvapara-yuga He carried a flute (Sri Krsna). In Kali-yuga He carries a danda (Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu). Now He is a sannyasi.

4) Balarama dasa says: O residents of Nadiya, please hear. Balarama has become an avadhuta, and Krsna has become a sannyasi.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This is to be sung in Raga Gandhara.
