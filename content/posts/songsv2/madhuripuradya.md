**TRANSLATION**

Refrain: Now, in springtime filled with the fragrance of splendid flowers, Lord Krsna enjoys pastimes with the gopis of Gokula.

1) He wears a garland of fresh campaka flowers. He has become a festival of transcendental bliss. Radha' kisses the moon of His mouth and Candravali holds Him with her graceful fingers.

2) He draws new moons on Visakha's body. He embraces Lalita. He places His arm around Syama. He enjoys pastimes with Padma.

3) He is embraced by Bhadra. He is decorated with kunkuma fallen from Saibya. Look! The transcendental form of the eternal Personality of Godhead enjoys pastimes in Vrndavana.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is sung in Raga Basant.
