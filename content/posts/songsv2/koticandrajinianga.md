**LYRICS:**

(1)

koṭi-candra jini ańga-kāntira vaibhava

durdānta pratāpa-ripu māne parābhava

(2)

araṇya pradeśe śuddha sneha anugata

cañcala govinda sańge vihare satata

(3)

śrī kṛṣṇera bala vīrya parijñāta hoiyā

sadā śikṣā dena jini anuja boliyā

(4)

sei dhenukāri vīra śrī baladeve

sadā stuti kori āmi āpanā śodhite

**TRANSLATION**

1-4) Just to purify myself I always praise the heroic killer of Dhenukasura, Sri Baladeva, whose bodily luster defeats the shining of millions of moons, who destroys the pride of His turbulent and powerful enemies, who always plays with pure affection with naughty Govinda in the woods, who is aware of Sri Krishna’s power and potency, but who still gives Him instructions, considering Him His younger brother.
