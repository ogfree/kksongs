**LYRICS:**

(Refrain)

e dhani mohe nā karu aru chanda

jānala bheṭali śyāmara chanda

(1)

niśasi nihārasi phuṭala kadamba

kara\-tale badana saghana abalamba

(2)

kṣaṇe tanu moḍasi kari kata bhańga

abirala pulaka mukula bharu ańga

(3)

bhāba ki gopasi gopata nā raha-i

maramaka bedana badane saba kaha-i

(4)

yatane nibārasi nayānake lola

gadagada śabade kahasi ādha bola

(5)

āna chale ańga nayāna chale pantha

saghane gatāgati karasi ekānta

(6)

dūre rahu gurujana-gauraba lāja

gobinda-dāsa kaha paḍala akāja

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) O beautiful gopi, you did not tell me anything. Still, I know what has happened. You must have met the dark moon Krsna.

1) You stare. You sigh. With your sighs the kadamba trees burst into bloom. Your head rests in your hands.

2) Sometimes you bend your body into how many awkward postures? Like budding flowers, the hairs of your body always stand erect.

3) Why do you try to hide your feelings? You cannot hide them. The expression on your face proclaims the pain in your heart.

4) You struggle to suppress the signs of what you feel. Your eyes are restless. You speak half words in a choked voice.

5) On some pretext you carefully watch the path. Your purpose in watching is only one.

6) Far away you have thrown all shyness and all respect for your elders and superiors. Govinda dasa says: Alas! This girl has fallen into mischief.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is sung in Raga Barati.
