sūnur adbhuta-sundaro 'jani nanda-rāja tavāyam

**TRANSLATION**

Refrain: O Nandaraja, a wonderfully handsome son is now born to you. Please give charity to the people of Vraja on this festive occasion.

1) The brahmanas are now full with ornaments and cows. O king of Vraja, please at once satisfy the singers like myself.

2) The hearts of those like me hanker for the treasure of the blissful sight of your son. This treasure has not yet been granted to anyone who has appealed for it.

3) I pray that I may always love your son, who is a dark swan playing in the Manasa lake of Sanatana Gosvami's heart.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is sung in Raga Asavari.
