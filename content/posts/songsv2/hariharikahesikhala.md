**LYRICS:**

(Refrain)

hari hari kāhe śikhala parakāra

guru-jane bāñci  micha-i bacanāmṛta

dinahi karala abhisāra

(1)

sabahu badhū-jana  calu bṛndābana

gaurī ārādhana lāgi

aichana mugadha  bacana racana kari

guru-jana anumati māgi

(2)

beśa banā-ota nanadī śunāyata

catura sakhī sañe bāta

gaurī ārādhimanoratha pūraba

paśupati nandana sātha

(3)

su-basita kusuma  kapūrita tāmbula

bhari le-i candana kaṭora

gobinda-dāsapatha daraśāyata

yāḿhā nāhi kaṇṭaka ācora

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) Ah! Ah! What did they say? Cheasting their elders with a host of nectar lies, they went to meet Krsna in broad daylight.

1) All the teenage gopis went to Vrndavana forest to worship Goddess Durga. Speaking sweet words, they asked their elders' permission.

2) They dressed in nice garments, talked with their sisters-in-law, and spoke clever words with their gopi\-friends. They declared all their desires would be fulfilled by worshiping Durga and Ganesa.

3) They brought with them fragrances, flowers, camphor, betel nuts, and cups of sandal paste. Govinda dasa took care no brambles blocked their path.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song was sung in Raga Tilak Kamod.
