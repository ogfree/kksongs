**LYRICS**

(Refrain)

bhāmini pṛccha na vāraḿ vāram

hanta vimuhyati vīkṣya mano mama ballava-rāja-kumāram

(1)

kuṭilaḿ mām avalokya navāmbujam upari cucumba sa rańgī

tena haṭhād aham abhavaḿ vepathu-maṇḍala-sañcalad-ańgī

(2)

dāḍima-latikām anu nistala-phala-namitāḿ sa dadhe hastam

tad-anubhavān mama dharmojjvalam api dhairya-dhanaḿ gatam astam

(3)

adaśad aśoka-latā-pallavam ayam atanu-sanātana-narmā

tad aham avekṣya babhūva ciraḿ bata vismṛta-kāyika-karmā

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) Beautiful one, please do not ask again and again. Now that I have seen the prince of the gopas, My heart has become enchanted.

1) Glancing at Me, passionate Krsna kissed a bending new lotus flower. Because of that hint My whole body is now violently trembling.

2) When He placed His hand on a pomegranate creeper bowed down with two round fruits, the splendor of My piety and the wealth of My peacefulness fled far away.

3) When I saw Him bite a red asoka flower as He continually joked, I at once forgot all My household duties.

**Remarks/ Extra Information****:**

This is to be sung in Carnatic Raga Saurastri.

Srila Jiva Goswami explains that this song is Srimati Radharani’s reply to the previous song (Song 7 in Volume 6 of the Stavamala), “Radha Nigada Nijam Pada.”
