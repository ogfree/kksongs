17) Lord Krsna is the chariot driver of Arjuna, and He established King Yudhisthira as the king of the entire world. He wears a crown of peacock feathers, the impersonal unmanifest Brahman has emanated from Him, and He is the ocean from which the nectar of Bhagavad-gita was churned.

18) Lord Krsna's beautiful feet were reddened by the rubies on the hoods of the Kaliya serpent. He was tied about the waist by Mother Yasoda, and He ate the foodstuffs offered by the wives of the Brahmanas. He killed the kings of the demons.

20) Lord Krsna is praised by eloquent verses and it is He who creates the places of pilgrimage. He is knowable by the Vedas, and He is an ocean of mercy. He is greater than the greatest, the soul of all holy places, and He is manifested as the different planets.

21) These 108 Holy Names of Lord Krsnadeva are the nectar of all songs, and they were formerly heard by the Lord Himself and by His devotee.

22) Because Lord Krsna is pleased when He is nicely glorified in prayers, I have composed these verses. This nectar of Lord Krsna's Holy Names will certainly give great spiritual bliss to those who hear them.

23) Whoever in this birth chants these Holy Names of Lord Krsna, will become free from all suffering, live for a long time, become wealthy, learned, austere, and travel to places of pilgrimage, becoming saintly.
