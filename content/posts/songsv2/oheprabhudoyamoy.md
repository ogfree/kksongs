**TRANSLATION**

1) Oh my Lord, oh most compassionate Personality! Your two divine lotus feet are beautifully decorating the summit of all the scriptures. And when those lotus feet in turn decorate the heads of all the spiritual masters coming in the disciplic succession, then their beauty and splendor increases hundred fold. Seeing this truth, my heart has become fully satisfied.

2) The desires of all the jiva souls are actually following the path which leads them to Your beautiful lotus feet, which are just purpose-trees as much as they bestow the fulfillment of the most cherished desires of all these souls. Indeed, Your feet are just like the very wealth of the dynasty of jivas, and they are the most revered object of worship for all of time to come. Thus they are the ultimate goal and refuge of all souls.

3) The divine lotus feet of the lotus-eyed Lord, are abounding in supreme spiritual bliss. Sincerely serving those divine feet continuously, Bhaktivinoda wants to satisfy them by remaining as a humble follower of the devotees of the Lord.
