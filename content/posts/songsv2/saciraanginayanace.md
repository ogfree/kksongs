(1)

śacīra āńgināya nāce viśvambhara rāya

hāsi hāsi phiri phiri māyere lukāy

(2)

vayane vasana diyā bale lukāinu

**TRANSLATION**

1) In the courtyard of Saci Mata, the child Visvambhara Raya plays. Smiling and giggling, he goes from one place to another, hiding from His mother.

2) Covering Himself with His cloth, He says, "I'm hiding!"  Saci Mata says to Visvambhara, "I don't see you!"

3) Holding the edge of His mother's sari, He dances about on tottering feet, in the skittish manner of a wagtail.

4) Vasudeva Ghosa says, “Such extraordinary beauty! Seeing the child-form of Nimai, the whole world becomes infatuated.”
