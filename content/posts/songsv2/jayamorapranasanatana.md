**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) Glory to Srila Rupa Goswami and Srila Sanatana Goswami! They are my breath of life. The two brothers are the shelter of those with no other refuge. They are the yupa (central pole in a sacrificial arena) in the yajna of bhakti\-yoga.

1) They are Vrindavana’s well filled with the sweet nectar of pure spiritual love. They are the ocean of mercy and the friends of those lost souls who have no master. In the assembly of devotees they are the kings.

2) They are the great generals leading the army of preachers who expertly speak on bhakti and the Bhagavatam. Their pure glories are known throughout the fourteen worlds, and are nectar for the tongue.

3) The dust of their lotus feet has become the Vaisnavas’ fragrant tilaka. Having deep reverence for Srila Vyasadeva, they always worship Sri Radha’s peerless lotus feet.

(Refrain 2) Glory to Srila Rupa Goswami and Srila Sanatana Goswami! They are the crest-jewels of saintly devotees. They are filled with the nectar of devotional love for Sri Sri Radha and .

4) Tasting the sweetness of residing in Vrndavan, they are filled with bliss and their bodily hairs stand up. Renouncing everything, they worship Vraja’s forest groves. Day and night they meditate on Radha’s love for Krishna.

5) These two brothers brought the mercy of Sri Krsna Caitanya, who is an ocean of com-passion. Without these two brothers I am help-less and without a master. Without these two brothers, the tree of my happiness has broken and fallen to the ground.
