**LYRICS:**

(Refrain)

sundari tuhu baḍi hṛdaya pāṣāṇa

tuyā lāgi madana\-        śarānale pīḍita

jība-ite saḿśaya kāna

(1)

baiṭhali taru\-tale         pantha nehāra-i

nayāne galaye ghana lora

rā-i rā-i kari      saghane japaye hari

tuyā bhābe taru deya kora

(2)

śītala nalinī-dala         tāhe malayānila

āgore lepa-i ańga

camaki camaki hari       uṭhata kata beri

hānata madana-tarańga

(3)

calaha bipine dhani        ramaṇī-śiromaṇi

jhāṭa kari bheṭaha kāna

gobinda-dāsera bāṇī      turite calaha dhani

kānu bhela bahuta nidāna

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) O beautiful girl, Your heart is like stone. Because of You Krsna is tormented, is wounded by Kamadeva's flaming arrows. Because of You Krsna's very life is now in doubt.

1) Sitting under a tree, Krsna watches the pathway. Tears glide from His eyes. "Radha! Radha!" is the japa He chants. He is overcome with love for You.

2) Bearing the fragrance of lotus petals, the cooling Malaya breeze anoints His body. Again and again He is startled. How many times does He stand up? Kamadeva's waves toss Him to and fro.

3) O beautiful girl, run to the forest. O crest jewel of all beautiful girls, go and meet Krsna. Govinda dasa says: O beautiful girl, quickly go. Krsna is on the verge of death.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is sung in Raga Dhanasri.
