**LYRICS:**

(1)

dasa gadadhara prana gora

puraba carita bhela bhora

(2)

bijuri barana tanu cora

kamala-nayana baha lora

(3)

kanaka-kamala mukha kanti

hasita khasaya mani moti

(4)

bipula pulaka-bhara kampa

hari hari bali de-i jhampa

(5)

na jana aha-nisi nija rase

saghana cikura cira khase

(6)

ghana ghana mahi padi yaya

hema-giri dharani lotaya

(7)

bhasala bhubana prema-rase

yadu eda-ila karma-dose

**TRANSLATION**

1) Lord Gaura is the life's breath or Gadadhara dasa. Hearing the pastimes He enjoyed in His previous avataras, Lora Gaura is overcome with ecstasy.

2) Lora Gaura's complexion is fair like a lightning flash. His original form, the form or Krsna, is carefully hidden within Him. Tears of ecstatic love stream from Lora Gaura's lotus eyes.

3) Lora Gaura's face is like a golden lotus. Lora Gaura joyfully laughs, showing the pearls of His graceful teeth.

4) Overcome with ecstasy, He trembles. The hairs of His body stand erect. Calling out “Hari! Hari!" He jumps in the air.

5) Overwhelmed by tasting the nectar of devotion from a person who is actually Himself, He does not know if it is day or night.

6) His lotus feet resemble the thunder clouds.

7) His ecstatic nectar of devotional love is enough to flood the three worlds. Only Yadu Dasa, due to his reactions of fruitive actions, is denied of this.
