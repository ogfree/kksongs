Refrain: Friend, in a dream last night I saw Mukunda decorated with a garland of jasmine flowers.

1) He had returned to Gokula from the king's city. He made His mother and father mad with happiness.

2) He inspired a tumultuous festival. His glance brought Me great happiness.

3) He was very handsome with a fresh gunja necklace. He was filled with love for His eternal friends.
