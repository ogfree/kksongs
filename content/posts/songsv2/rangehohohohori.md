**LYRICS:**

(Refrain)

rańge ho ho ho hori - khelato naolo kiśorī

(1)

bājato tāla, ravāba pākhowāja

sakhīgaṇa ghana karatāli

kuńkuma candana, ābira uṛata ghana,

barikhata ghana picakārī

(2)

duhuń duhuń khelana, samara prabandha\-hi

duhuń pora duhuń poṛu bhori

jitanu jitanu ghana, duhuń dale garajana,

sakhīgaṇa bhaṇa raba jori

(3)

khone khone sthagita, vadana duhuń nirīkhana,

joichana cāńda cakori

tahi śivarām, dāsa mana ānande,

heri hāsato thori thori

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) 'Thus the adolescent girl enjoys playing the ho ho ho holi\-game."

1) The cymbals, sarod and pakhowaja\-drum resounded and the sakhis clapped their hands. kunkuma, sandalwood pulp and abira were densely flying around, being squirted out and showered thickly by the syringes.

2) Both Radha and Krsna played a beautiful battle and lots of colors fell on both of Them. Both parties shouted out: "We have won! We have won!", and the sakhis made a lot of noise.

3) Sometimes Their play stagnated because They stared at Each others' faces like the Cakora\-birds staring at the moon. When Sivarama das a sees this he slightly smiles out of bliss.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is sung in Raga Mayura Basanta in Ektal.
