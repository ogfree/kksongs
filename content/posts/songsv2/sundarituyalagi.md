**LYRICS:**

(Refrain)

sundari tuyā lāgi sambādala kāna

biraha-kṣīṇa tanu        anukhaṇa jarajara

aba ithe bidhi bhela bāma

(1)

cānda nehāri          candane tanu lepana

tāpa saha-i nā pāra

dhabala nicola      baha-i nā pāra-i

kaiche karaha abhisāra

(2)

yatanahi megha        mallāra ālāpa-i

timira parāṇa gati āśe

ā-ota jalada        tatahi uḍi yā-ota

utapata dīragha niśāse

(3)

tuyā guṇa nāma        gāna japi jība-i

bahu pulakāyita dehā

gobinda-dāsa kaha        iha aparūpa naha

yāhā iha naba naba lehā

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) O beautiful girl, Krsna talks about You. Separated from You, His body has become emaciated. At every moment He is distraught. Fate is tormenting Him.

1) He gazes at the moon. He anoints his limbs with sandal paste. Still He cannot tolerate the flames of His fever. He cannot wear His white shawl. How can he meet with You?

2) Wishing to hide in the darkness, He plays the alap of Raga Megha Malhara on His flute. As the clouds come and go, He deeply sighs.

3) He sings of Your virtues. It is only by chanting japa of Your name that He lives. The hairs of His body stand erect. Govinda dasa says: These symptoms are not surprising. Are they not the signs of new love?

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is sung in Raga Sri.
