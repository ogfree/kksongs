**LYRICS:**

(1)

gurudev!

boḍo kṛpā kori’, gauḍa-vana mājhe,

godrume diyācho sthāna

ājñā dila more,  ei braje bosi’,

hari-nāma koro gāna

(2)

kintu kabe prabhu,  yogyatā arpibe,

e dāsere doyā kori’

citta sthira habe,  sakala sohibo,

ekānte bhajibo hari

(3)

śaiśava-yauvane,  jaḍa-sukha-sańge,

abhyāsa hoilo manda

nija-karma-doṣe,  e deho hoilo,

bhajanera pratibandha

(4)

vārdhakye ekhona,  pañca-roge hata,

kemone bhojibo bolo’

kāńdiyā kāńdiyā,  tomāra caraṇe,

poḍiyāchi suvihvala

**TRANSLATION**

1) Gurudeva! Because you are so merciful, you gave me a place in Godruma amid the woodlands of Gauda, with this order to fulfill: “Dwell here in this Vrndavana and sing the holy name of Hari.”

2) But when, O master, out of your great mercy, will you bestow upon this servant of yours the spiritual competence to fulfill that order? When will my mind become tranquil and fixed? When will I endure all hardships and serve Lord Hari without distractions?

3) Due to attachment to worldly pleasures in childhood and youth, I have developed bad habits. Because of these sinful acts my body has become an impediment to the service of the Supreme Lord.

4) Now, in old age, afflicted by the five-fold illnesses, how will I serve the Lord? O master, please tell me. I have fallen at your feet weeping, overwhelmed by anxiety.
