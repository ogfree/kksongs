**LYRICS:**

(1)

(prāṇeśwar!) kohobuń ki śarama ki bāt

aichana pāp nāhi,  jo hāma nā koraluń,

sahasra sahasra beri nāth

(2)

sohi karama-phala,  bhave moke peśa-i,

dokha deobo āb kāhi

takhonaka parinām,  kachu nā bicāraluń,

āb pachu taraite cāhi

(3)

dokha vicāra-i,  tuńhu danḍa deobi,

hāma bhoga korabuń saḿsār

karato gatāgati,  bhakata-jana-sańge,

mati rohu caraṇe tohār

(4)

āpana caturpana,  tuwā pade sońpaluń,

hṛdoya-garava dūre gelo

dīna-doyā-moya,  tuwā kṛpā niramala,

bhakativinoda āśā bhelo

**TRANSLATION**

1) How much more shall I tell You of my shameful story? There is no sin which I have not committed thousands and thousands of times.

2) My life in this world has been one of affliction and torment as a result of those sins. Whom will I blame but myself? At the time I did not consider the consequences; now, in the aftermath, I seek to be saved.

3) After judging my sins, You should punish me, for I deserve to suffer the pangs of rebirth in this world. I only pray that, as I wander through repeated births and deaths, my mind may ever dwell at Your lotus feet in the company of Vaisnavas.

4) I offer You this judicious prayer. My heart’s false pride has gone far away. O You who are so kind to the meek, Your pure mercy has become Bhaktivinoda’s only hope.
