(Refrain)

jaya jaya goracanda kalusa-binasa

patita-pabana jaga-tarana karana, sankirtana parakasa

praphullita kanaka-kamala mukha-mandala

nayana khanjana tahe saje

digha lalata majhe, sri-hari-mandira saje

adwaita nityananda

bijayananda dase, ananda-sayare bhase,

carana\-kamala makaranda

**TRANSLATION**

Refrain: Glory, glory to Lord Gauracandra, the destroyer of sins, the purifier of the fallen, the savior of the worlds, the Lord who revealed the sankirtana movement of chanting the holy names!

1) The circle of His face is a blossoming golden lotus. His eyes are restless khanjana birds. His broad forehead is anointed with the tilaka that is Lord Hari's temple. He carries a water pot. A kaupina is tied about His waist.

2) His glorious arms reach to His knees. A malati garland swings to and fro from His neck. His tall form enchants the world's hearts. Like kadamba filaments, the hairs of His body stand erect in ecstasy.

3) The blossoming flowers of the soles of His feet are red like the rising sun. He is not different from Advaita and Nityananda. The nectar at the lotus flowers of His feet makes Vijayananda dasa float in an ocean of bliss.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This is to be sung in Raga Mangala.
