**TRANSLATION**

1) His arms extend to His knees and He appears to be like a golden doll. His form is adorned with a cloth that has the color of the rising sun. His beauty is incomparable.

2) His magnanimous form shines brightly with a beautiful smile radiating from His lotus like face. His large and prominent chest and broad shoulders are even more majestic than a lion’s.

3) His toe nails are brighter than the full moon and golden ankle bells adorn them. Seeing His exquisite beauty to be more brilliant than the sun, the entire world becomes enchanted.

4) The incarnations for the age of Kali are Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and Nityananda Prabhu. Without considering whether one is sinful or a miscreant, They distribute Their mercy. Vrndavana dasa sings glory of These two personalities: His worshippable Lords Sri Krsna Caitanya Mahaprabhu and Nityananda Prabhu.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This is sung in Raga Kalyana in Bhajani Tala.
