**LYRICS:**

(1)

jaya jaya kalaraba nadīyā nagare

janama labhila gaurā śacīra udare

(2)

phālguna pūrnimā tithi nakṣatra phālguni

śubhakṣaṇe janamilā gaurā dvijamaṇi

(3)

pūrnimāra candra jini kiraṇa prakāśa

dhūre gela andhakāra pāiyā nirāśa

(4)

dvāpare nandera ghare kṛṣṇa avatāra

yasodā udare janma bidita saḿsāra

(5)

śacīra udare ebe janma nadīyāte

kali-yugera jīva saba nistāra karite

(6)

vāsudeva ghoṣe kahe mane kari āśā

gaura pada dvandva hṛde kariyā bharasā

**TRANSLATION**

1) As sweet sounds of "Glory! Glory!" filled the towns of Nadiya, Lord Gaura took birth in Saci's womb.

2) The day was the full-moon day of the month of Phalguna. The star was Phalguni. At that auspicious moment Lord Gaura, the jewel of the twice-born, took birth.

3) When Lord Gaura's effulgence defeated the full moon, the blinding darkness gave up all hope. Deeply dejected, it fled far away.

4) During Dvapara-yuga, Lord Krsna descended into King Nanda's home. The people of the world thought Krsna had taken birth in Yasoda's womb.

5) In the same way, to deliver the fallen souls in Kali-yuga, Lord Gaura took birth in Saci's womb in Nadiya.

6) Vasudeva Ghosa says: In my heart I keep my hope. In my heart I take shelter of Lord Gaura's feet.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This is to be sung in Raga Todi.
