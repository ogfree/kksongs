**TRANSLATION**  
1) O Sri Narasimha, who is omnipresent, may Your nails protect me and others at all times. Just as a lion attacks powerful elephant groups and splits apart their heads with its nails and the vajrayudha (Indra's defense weapon) splits the highest mountains, in the similar way, the Asuras (who through the blessings of Lord Brahmadeva, Lord Siva and the demigods) are like powerful exhilarating elephants who are easily killed by each of Lord Nrsimhadeva's nails which are precious and powerful.

  
2) All demigods are devoted to and praying to this nail, which eliminates all bad elements in this world. They are very devoted to this nail as it will give all six senses of a brahman or devatas. This nail will even give complete knowledge and the gods will come out of the darkness (of ignorance). By praying to this nail, they will get peace and knowledge of all the qualities of Lord Sri Hari.

  
3) O Lord Nrsimhadeva, who has Sri Lakshmidevi by His side, there is no body equal to you. If there is any thing which is equal, it is 'astama rasa' the famous six essences. Similarly, there is nobody equal or uttama \[more excellent\] than you.

4) There are many Brahma's, many Rudra's, many Indra's and all of these and other demigods became ashes because of your smallest vision. Your vision is like the smallest firefly \[a twinkling insect which glows in night\], yet it has the brightness of the sun's rays.
