hari he

tumi jagatera pitā         tumi jagatera mātā

doyita tanoya hari tumi

tad-itare prākṛta bidhāne

**TRANSLATION**

1) Oh my Lord Hari! You are the Father of the universe; You are the Mother of the universe, as well as the Lover and son of all beings. You are the most dearly beloved friend of the heart, the spiritual master of all, the ultimate refuge and the divine purpose-tree that fulfills everyone's desires...

2) ...But my relationship with You is simply that of Your insignificant menial servant, Your humble attendant, always praying for Your shelter, surrendered at Your divine lotus feet. I am simply Your plaything, Your property, Your protected servant; my only identification is my personal attachment to being Your devotee.

3) Bhaktivinoda says that there is no relationship of "I and mine" other than this true conception of being related to Krsna as His eternal servant. Maintaining this position of eternal service, he thus accepts the real principle of "I and mine" which is the natural, unchangeable relationship with Krsna and all His devotees. Anything besides that would just be material and temporary.
