**LYRICS:**

(1)

kali-yuge sri-caitanya     abani karila dhanya

patita-pabana yara bana

purabe radhara bhabe     gauranga la-iha ebe

nija rupa dhari kanca sona

(2)

gauranga patita-pabana abatari

kali bhujangama dekhi     hari-name jiba rakhi

apani ha-ila dhanvantari

(3)

gadadhara adi yata     maha maha bhagabata

tara saba gora-guna gaya

akhila bhubana pati   goloke yanhara sthiti

hari bali abani lothaya

(4)

sonari puraba guna     murachaya punah punah

parase dharani ulasita

carana kamala kiba    nakhara ujora sota

gobinda-dasa se bancita

**TRANSLATION**

1) In Kali-yuga, Lord Caitanya made the earth fortunate and glorious. He was the purifier of the fallen souls. At that time He manifested a form effulgent like gold, a form effulgent like Sri Radha’s.

2\. (Refrain) Descending to this world, Lord Caitanya purified the fallen souls. Seeing the snake of Kali-yuga (biting the fallen souls), Lord Caitanya was like Dhanvantari (demigod of medicine). Giving them the medicine of Lord Krsna's holy names, He rescued the fallen souls.

3) Gadadhara and the other great devotees chanted Lord Gaura's glories. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, the master of the all the worlds, the master who stays in the spiritual world of Goloka, descended to this world. He chanted "Hari!" In ecstasy He rolled on the ground.

4) Remembering the glories of His previous incarnation, He fell unconscious again and again. At these times the earth became filled by bliss by His touch. The touch of His lotus feet and lotus toenails made the whole world glorious. Only Govinda dasa was cheated of Their touch.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**
