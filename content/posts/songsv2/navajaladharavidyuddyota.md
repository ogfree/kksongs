**TRANSLATION**

1) O mind, time and again worship the youthful lovers Sri Radha-Krsna, who together appear like lightning flashing from a fresh monsoon cloud, whose lovely lotus faces always beam contented happiness and are adorned with lotus eyes, who wear brilliant moon-shaped crowns, whose foreheads, decorated with charming sandalpaste tilaka, are rendered more beautiful being surrounded by Their glistening curly locks of hair, and whose entire appearance is completely dazzling.

2) O mind, time and again worship the youthful lovers Sri Radha-Krsna, Radha wearing blue cloth and Krsna dressed in yellow. Their bodies are fully decorated with candana, Radha’s glistening like a golden jewel and Krsna’s like a sapphire. They wear golden necklaces and bracelets. Their hearts are lovingly immersed in the rasa dance.

3) O mind, always be immersed in worshiping the youthful lovers Sri Radha-Krsna Candra, whose charming dresses steal devotees’ minds; who display elegant three-fold bending poses; who smile mildly and sweetly; whose ears are adorned with shining, beautiful earrings; who are the very best of jokesters; who are the best of actors always wearing gorgeous costumes; and who are always attracting each other, Krsna by playing the flute and Radha by Her dancing.

4) O mind, always remain alert to worship the youthful lovers Sri Radha-Krsna Candra, who possess innumerable exalted qualities and who are extremely clever and skillful in tasting rasa in Their loving affairs; who are worshiped by demigods and sages as well as ordinary humans; who are decorated with beautiful attire, fish-shaped earrings studded with brilliant jewels and other ornaments; whose enchanting, gentle smiles are accompanied by sidelong glances; and who bestow the dharma and karma of prema-seva upon Their devotees (or who remove all Their devotees’ material attachments, including their dharma and karma).

5) O mind, time and again I implore you to remain alert to worship the youthful lovers Sri Radha-Krsna Candra, who wear golden crowns upon Their heads, whose bodies are decorated with many colored flowers, who wander through all the forests of Vrndavana enjoying pastimes, who are the embodiment of condensed ananda, and whose miraculous lotus feet are served by all demigods and goddesses.

6) O mind, always worship the youthful lovers Sri Radha-Krsna, whose very, very soft bodies are adorned with fragrant flower garlands, whose charmingly dressed forms are served by uncountable numbers of beautiful vraja-sundaris, who are beautifully dressed, and who are conversant with all the Vedas which are contemplated in trance by the sages and demigods.

7) O mind, I implore you time and again to always remain immersed in worshiping the youthful lovers Sri Radha-Krsna, whose forms are the embodiment of the sweetest sweetness, who pulverize the pride of wicked and arrogant persons, who bestow benedictions upon the best of the demigods including Mahadeva Siva, who bestow all varieties of perfections, who are thoroughly engrossed in tasting the nectar of transcendental bliss (ananda-cinmaya-rasa), and who are masters in the arts of singing, dancing, and playing musical instruments.

8) O mind, remain forever immersed in worshiping the youthful lovers Sri Radha-Krsna Candra, whose svarupa is the essence of the Vedas; who through the agency of Their expansions perform the creation, maintenance, and destruction of the material universes; who are ever-fresh youths almost touching adolescence; who are eternally situated at the yoga-pitha in Vrndavana; and who deliver the sinful.

9) Sadhakas who faithfully recite this supremely charming Yugala-kisorastakam will surely obtain the perfection of rendering direct service to the lotus feet of the bestowers of all perfections, the youthful lovers Sri Radha-Krsna – of this there is no doubt.
