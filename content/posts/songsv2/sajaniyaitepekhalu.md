**LYRICS:**

(Refrain)

sajani yā-ite pekhalu kāna

tabadhari jaga-bhari          bharala kusuma-śara

nayane nā heriye āna

(1)

ḍhala ḍhala sajala         jalada tanu śohana

mohana abharaṇa sāja

aruṇa nayana gati        bijurī camaka jiti

dagadhala kulabatī-lāja

(2)

majhu mukha daraśi         bihasi tanu moḍa-i

bigalita mohana baḿśa

nā jāniye kona      manoratha ākula

kiśalaya\-dale karu daḿśa

(3)

ataye se majhu mana        jwalatahi anukhaṇa

dolata capala parāṇa

gobinda-dāsa        micha-i āśoyāsa

tabahu nā milala kāna

**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) O gopi\-friend, I saw Krsna. If I attain Him I will have the whole world. He struck me with the flower-arrow of His glance. Now my eyes see none but Him.

1) His form was glorious like a monsoon cloud. He was charming with graceful ornaments. The glance from his reddish eyes defeats lightning. That glance burned this saintly girl's shyness into ashes.

2) When He saw my face, He smiled. His body trembled, and He dropped His charming flute. He bit a budding twig. What desire filled Him? I do not know.

3) Since that time my heart burns at every moment. My restless life-breath trembles. Govinda dasa says: Your hope is false. Krsna will not meet with you yet.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is sung in Raga Gandhara.
