**TRANSLATION**

(Refrain) O gopi friend, today I saw a handsome teenage boy in Vraja. The cakora birds of my eyes became wild to taste the sweetness of the moonlight of the moon of His face.

1) He was crowned with the feather of a wild peacock. The fragrance of His jasmine garland made the buzzing black bees wild with bliss.

2) His form was a dark monsoon cloud. His eyebrows were the archer Kamadeva's two bows. From His lotus eyes Kamadeva fired his five arrows. The saintly gopis' hearts were gravely wounded. Their lives are now in doubt.

3) His glistening jewel earrings shaped like Kamadeva's sharks swing to and fro from His ears. The fish of the gopis' hearts gaze at that shark. Now that shark devours those small fish. Govinda dasa thinks in this way.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song is sung in Raga Sindhura.
