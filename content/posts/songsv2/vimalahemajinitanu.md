**LYRICS:**

(1)

vimala hema jini tanu anupāma re

tāhe śobhe nānā phula-dāma

kadamba keśara jini ekati pulaka re

tara mājhe bindu bindu ghāma

(2)

calite nā pāre gorā- cānda gosāñi re

balite nā pāre ādha bola

bhāve avaśa ha-iyā hari hari bolāiyā

ācaṇḍāle dhari dei kola

(3)

gamana manthara-gati jini maya-matta hātī

bhāvāveśe ḍhuli ḍhuli jāya

aruṇa vasana-chabi jini prabhātera ravi

gorā ańge laharī khelāya

(4)

e hena sampada kāle gorā nā bhajiluñ hele

tuyā pade nā kariluñ āśa

śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya ṭhākura śrī-nityānanda

guṇa gāya vṛndāvana dāsa

**TRANSLATION**

1) His peerless form defeats the purest gold and is decorated with a wealth of many kinds of flowers. The hairs on that form, standing erect and interspersed with drops of perspiration, defeat the beauty of the filaments of the kadamba flower.

2) That Lord Gauracanda has lost the power to walk properly. He is even unable to speak more than half words. Overcome with ecstatic love and chanting, “Hari! Hari!” He embraces everyone, down to the lowly candala, in His arms.

3) Overcome with ecstatic love, His staggering gait defeats the walking of intoxicated elephants. Clothed in saffron garments surpassing the beauty of the rising sun, the movement of His golden limbs resembles the dancing of waves.

4) Alas! At that blissfully fortunate time I did not worship Gaura. I did not yearn to attain His feet. Lamenting in this way, Vrndavan Das sings the glories of Sri Krsna Caitanya and Thakur Sri Nityananda.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This song was featured in Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura’s compilation, **[Sri Ksanada Gita Cintamani](http://kksongs.org/authors/literature/kgc.html)**, Ekadasa Ksanada Krsna Ekadasi (the 11th night, eleventh night of the dark portion of the month), as the first song.
