**TRANSLATION**

1) O Srila Gaura Kisora, you are my parama guru, the spiritual master of my beloved guru. Your position is unparalleled among the splendid devotees of Sri Gauranga, and your renowned and surrendered servant is Sri Dayita dasa. I offer my obeisances repeatedly unto you, Srila Gaura Kisora.

2) O Srila Gaura Kisora, you have revealed our divine guide who is the sole friend of the fallen souls in the material universe. Sri Gurudeva is famous throughout the three worlds as Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakura. I offer my respects again and again unto you, Srila Gaura Kisora.

3) Sometimes you live in total seclusion within the forests of Vraja dhama. However, your heart eternally relishes the sweet pastimes of that Divine Couple, Sri Sri Radha-Krsna. Your outer appearance, couched in extreme renunciation, and your style of dress, befits one who lacks superficial consciousness of this world, an avadhuta. I offer my obeisances constantly unto you, Srila Gaura Kisora.

4) O Srila Gaura Kisora, you freely roam within the very same jungles of Sri Gaura dhama where Sri Gauranga passed His days. You sportively play in the sacred dust along the banks of the Ganges River wearing the purest loincloth and holding a water pot, a kamandalu. I offer my respects again and again unto you, Srila Gaura Kisora.

5) O Srila Gaura Kisora, you are joyfully intoxicated from chanting the sweet names of Lord Krsna as you humbly beg your sustenance from one house to another. Even the various demigods offer their respects unto your magnificent personality. I constantly offer my obeisances unto you, Srila Gaura Kisora.

6) O Srila Gaura Kisora, sometimes you cry, and yet at other times you sweetly laugh as you wander along, overtaken by spontaneous love’s charm for your beloved Lordships. Widely singing your praises, everyone falls in respect and honor for you. I eternally offer my respects unto you, Srila Gaura Kisora.

7) O Srila Gaura Kisora, you share a friendly relationship with that famous personality, Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura. And the gentle grace of Srila Jagannatha dasa babaji reflects upon you like the full radiant moon. And you are like a grand ocean embodying the ambrosial love of Sriman Mahaprabhu. I offer my obeisances repeatedly unto you, Srila Gaura Kisora.

8) O Srila Gaura Kisora, you departed on Visnu Utthapana Ekadasi in the Vaisnava month of Damodara, after completing that grand vow during the month of Karttika. I eternally offer my respects unto you, Srila Gaura Kisora, as you possess the highest attainable wealth – the qualities of an intimate lady servitor nurtured by Srimati Radhika.

9) O Srila Gaura Kisora, you abandoned the association of wordly people and went to live alone at Kuliya in the island of Koladwipa, where you accepted the service of Sri Dayita dasa. Your effulgent personality illumines the temple of Sri Dayita dasa in the sacred abode of Sri Mayapura dhama. I eternally offer my obeisances unto you, Srila Gaura Kisora.

10) O Srila Gaura Kisora, although deeply sunk within the filthy mire of my sinful offenses, my pitiful soul prays for the Lord’s causeless mercy. Kindly extend your grace and rescue this fallen soul. I eternally offer my respects unto you, Srila Gaura Kisora dasa babaji.
