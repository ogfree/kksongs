**TRANSLATION**

1) I yearn to see in the land of Vraja the jewel of youthful couples glistening as two splendid lotuses filled with sweetness, Their transcendental limbs eclipsing the fragrance of fresh musk, and Their hearts overwhelmed with the intoxication of love for each other.   

2) I yearn to see in the land of Vraja the jewel of youthful couples enjoying many pastimes together, the splendor of Their transcendental forms eclipsing the glittering garlands of new monsoon clouds and the ketaki flowers of the golden mountains.   

3) I yearn to see in the land of Vraja the jewel of youthful couples delighted by newer and newer feelings of love, and the tips of Their nails washed by the waves of sweetness of millions of peerlessly beautiful fair-complexioned girls and handsome Kamadevas.   

4) I yearn to see in the land of Vraja the jewel of youthful couples, who yearn to hear the other's sweet words, and who, the moons of Their faces bowed with shyness, gaze at each other with fleeting, dancing glances from eyes restless with passion.

5) I yearn to see in the land of Vraja the jewel of youthful couples. As Their affectionate friends look on, with faces blossoming with shyness They happily glance at each other's transcendental bodies, in this way beginning the first skirmish of the great battle of Kama.

6) I yearn to see in the land of Vraja the jewel of youthful couples, who are the acaryas of transcendental amorous battle, whose feet the saintly young gopis aspire to serve, who are expert at relishing the happiness of amorous battle, who are a single life, and who are each other's decoration.

7) I yearn to see in the land of Vraja the jewel of youthful couples. Exhausted by enjoying many pastimes in the water, They rest in a charming forest by the shore of a beautiful lake. Their affectionate friends bring madhu nectar. They make each other drink. They make Their friends drink.

8) I yearn to see in the land of Vraja the jewel of youthful couples. Bound by the rope of love that Kamadeva has secured with many tight knots, They are completely under each other's dominion. They are famous in the world as Sri Sri Radha-Madhava.   

9) A person who very carefully and humbly reads these eight verses describing the yearning to see the youthful divine couple and filled with the sweetness of transcendental love, will be able with his own eyes to serve the peerless, supremely handsome and charming divine couple.
