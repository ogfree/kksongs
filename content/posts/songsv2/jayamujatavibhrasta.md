**TRANSLATION**

1) O Krsna, all glories unto You. When the cows became distressed and lost their way in the tall grasses of the Munjatavi forest, You removed their distress. When the cowherd boys became afraid of the blazing forest fire, You instructed them to close their eyes.

2) O Krsna, You swallowed the great forest fire in the tall grasses, and the cows and cowherd boys in Bhandiravana forest considered that You were certainly the supreme monarch of all mystic powers. I offer respectful obeisances unto You.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This is based on Srimad Bhagavatam Canto 10 Chapter 19.
