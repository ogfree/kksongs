**LYRICS:**

(1)

hari he

āmi to' cañcala-mati amaryāda khudra ati

asūya-prasaba sadā mora

pāpiṣṭha kṛtaghna mānī  nṛśaḿsa bañcane jñānī

kāma-baśe thāki sadā ghora

(2)

e heno durjana ho'ye e duḥkha-jaladhi bo'ye

caritechi soḿsāra-sāgore

kemone e bhabāmbudhi  pāra ho'ye nirabadhi

taba pada-sebā mile more

(3)

tomāra koruṇā pāi  taba to' toriyā jāi

amki e duranta-sāgora

tumi prabhu śrī-caraṇe  rākho dāse dhūli\-sane

nahe bhaktibinoda kātora

**TRANSLATION**

1) Oh my dear Lord Hari! I am most fickle-minded, completely bereft of proper etiquette and extremely insignificant. I always radiate an intense effulgence of jealousy and malice. I willingly perform sinful acts, I love to do harm to my well-wishing benefactors, and I am unnecessarily puffed up with false prestige. Ferociously vicious like a barbarian, I am vastly learned in the art of deceiving others. I am always obsessed under the control of lusty motives, which are my very breath of life.

2) Being such a sinful rogue, I am completely submerged in this ocean of material tribulation as I aimlessly wander here and there in the vast ocean of birth and death. How will I ever be able to cross over this deep ocean of nescience and enter into the eternal service of Your divine lotus feet??

3) Only if I get Your causeless mercy, then I can certainly cross over this miserable ocean of suffering. Now, my dear Lord, Bhaktivinoda is humbly requesting You to kindly keep this servant as just one of the many particles of dust under the safe shelter of Your beautiful lotus feet... then I'll be fully satisfied.
