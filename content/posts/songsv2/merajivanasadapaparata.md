**LYRICS**

(1)

merā jīvana,  sadā pāpa rata,

nāhiń hai punya kā leṣa

sabhī ko duḥkha,  diyā hai kitanā,

diyā jīvoń ko kleśa

(2)

nija sukha kāraṇa,  bhaya nahiń pāpa se,

dayā-hīna swārtha\-rata

para-sukha se duḥkhī,  sadā mithya-bhāṣī,

para-duḥkha sukha-kara

(3)

aśeṣa kāmanā,  hṛdaya more,

krodhī, dambha-parāyana

sadā mada-matta,  viṣaye mohita,

hiḿsā-garva vibhūṣana

(4)

nidrālasya matta,  sukārye virata,

dukārye udyogī māni

pratiṣṭha lāgi,  śāṭhya-ācaraṇa,

hūń lobhī sadā kāmī

(5)

maiń hūń durjana,  saj-jana-varjita,

aparādhi nirantara

śubha-karma-binā,  sadā anartha-manāḥ,

nānā duḥkha se jara jara

(6)

ab hai buḍḍhāpā, upāya-vihīna

hūń maiń dīna akiñcana

bhakativinoda,  prabhu ke caraṇa meń,

kare yeh duḥkha nivedana

**TRANSLATION**

1) I am an impious sinner and have caused others great anxiety and trouble.

2) I have never hesitated to perform sinful act for my own enjoyment. Devoid of all compassion, concerned only with my own selfish interests, I am remorseful seeing others happy. I am a perpetual liar, and the misery of others is a source of great pleasure for me.

3) The material desires within the core of my heart are unlimited. I am wrathful, devoted to false pride and arrogance, intoxicated by vanity, and bewildered by worldly affairs. Envy and egotism are the ornaments I wear.

4) Ruined by laziness and sleep, I resist all pious deeds; yet I am very active and enthusiastic to perform wicked acts. For worldly fame and reputation I engage in the practice of deceitfulness. Thus I am destroyed by my own greed and am always lustful.

5) A vile, wicked man such as this, rejected by godly people, is a constant offender. I am such a person, devoid of all good works, forever inclined toward evil, worn out and wasted by various miseries.

6) Now in old age, deprived of all means of success, humbled and poor, Bhaktivinoda submits his tale of grief at the feet of the Supreme Lord.
