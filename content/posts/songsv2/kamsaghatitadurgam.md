**TRANSLATION**

1) O Lord Krsna, I offer respectful obeisances unto You. When Kamsa attempted to violently kill Durga-devi, she told him that You had already been born. Kamsa became amazed, and he released Your father, mother and relatives (from the prison).

2) O Krsna, Kamsa, his mind purified by constantly remembering You with fear, became enlightened, and he spoke transcendental knowledge to Your mother and father and thus pacified them.

3) O Lord  Krsna, trapped in the verbal network of bad  advice  form  his demonic  ministers, Kamsa agreed to a very wicked plan. Kamsa transgressed the desires of the saintly devotees, and in this way it appeared that his life was soon to end.

**REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:**

This is based on Srimad Bhagavatam Canto 10 Chapter 4.
