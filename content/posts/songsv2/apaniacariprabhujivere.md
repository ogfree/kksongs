**LYRICS:**

(1)

āpani ācari prabhu jīvere śikhāya

āpna vañcaka yei sei jirjane bhajāya

(2)

jagat bhariyā gela jagāi mādhāiye

nityānanda vaḿśa bāḍāya śiṣya sampradāye

(3)

khāy dāy thāke veśa ha’ye cintā hīna

vaiṣṇavera ucita nahe thākā dayā hīna

(4)

mādhurya kādambinī grandtha cakravartī gāya

siddhānta dekhaha tathā kibā tāńra rāy

**TRANSLATION**

1) The Lord sets example Himself to teach the spirit souls. The one who performs nirjana bhajana simply cheats himself.

2) The world has now become full of Jagais and Madhais. The dynasty of Lord Nityananda has increased its following of disciples.

3) Eating, sleeping, wearing the dress, and remaining unconcerned is not proper for Vaisnava, as this is without mercy.

4) According to the scripture “Madhurya Kadambini” written by Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura, see what conclusion is and what his judgment is.
