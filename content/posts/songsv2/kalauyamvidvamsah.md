**TRANSLATION**

1) By performing the sacrifice of congregational chanting of the holy name, scholars in the age of Kali worship Lord Krsna, who is now non-blackish because of the great upsurge of feelings of Srimati Radharani. He is the only worshipable Deity for the paramahamsas, who have attained the highest stage of the fourth order (sannyasa). May that Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Caitanya, show us His great causeless mercy.

2) Loudly shouting “Jaya!” as He manifested His sankirtana pastimes that delighted even the fallen and sinful, and His hips bound by a silk garment that eclipsed the splendor of the rising sun, He pacified His mother's grief. May that Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Caitanya, show us His great causeless mercy.

3) Lord Krsna desired to taste the limitless nectarean mellows of love of one of His multitude of loving damsels (Sri Radha), and so He has assumed the form of Lord Caitanya. He has tasted that love while hiding His own dark complexion with Her effulgent yellow color. May that Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Caitanya, show us His great causeless mercy.

4) By the demons He is never worshiped with love. For the surrendered devotees He defeats the power of material destiny in the three worlds. He is handsome, blissful, and charming. May that Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Caitanya, show us His great causeless mercy.

5) He is the shelter of the people of Bengal. His glory is manifested in Navadvipa. By birth He ornaments the brahmana community, which is worshiped in all the worlds. By accepting it, He purifies the paramahamsa-asrama in this world. May that Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Caitanya, show us His great causeless mercy.

6) To reveal the truth of pure transcendental love in this world He first jubilantly drank with His mouth the nectar of the holy name, and then discharged it from eyes eyes on the pretext of shedding tears. May that Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Caitanya, show us His great causeless mercy.

7) His form is as splendid as new gold. His waist is decorated with a water pot. He is as graceful as a regal young elephant. By appreciating His own krsna-prasadam garlands, He teaches His dear associates. May that Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Caitanya, show us His great causeless mercy.

8) His smiling glance at once drives away all the bereavements of the world, and His very words enliven the auspicious creepers of devotion by expanding their leaves. Taking shelter of His lotus feet invokes transcendental love of God at once. May that Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Caitanya, show us His great causeless mercy.

9) At every step may the glorious Supreme Personality of Godhead bring both transcendental happiness and grant auspicious pure love for His own lotus feet to that person who very happily reads these eight verses, which contain the fresh, sweet fragrance of the many blossoming flowers of the glories of Lord Caitanya, the son of Saci.
