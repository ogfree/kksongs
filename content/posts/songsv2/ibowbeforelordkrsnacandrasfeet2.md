**LYRICS:**

(1)

I bow before Lord Krsnacandra's feet,

Feet that with a dancing motion walk,

Feet with marks of gracefulness replete,

Feet that seem to eloquently talk

(2)

With jingling jewel anklets glistening,

Feet that mark the forest's sacred ground,

Feet that quickly stop as, listening

To the faraway and unexpected sound

(3)

Of Vrajapura's doe-eyed teenage girls

Talking and joking and laughing as they take

Wild flowers from the trees and as their curls

And eyes move restlessly the playful rake

(4)

Lord Krsnacandra stops O then arise

Festivals of smiles within His eyes.
