**LYRICS:**

(1)

āja viraja me horī re rasiyā

horī re rasiyā, barajorī re rasiyā

(2)

apane apane ghara nikasī

koī sāvari koī gorī re rasiyā

(3)

kauna gāva ke gvālā kahiye

kauna gāva rādhā gorī re rasiyā

(4)

nandagāva ke gvālā kahiye

barasāne kī rādhā gorī re rasiyā

(5)

kauna ke hātha kanaka picakārī

kauna ke kātha kamorī re rasiyā

(6)

kānhā ke hātha kanaka picakārī

rādhā ke hātha kamorī re rasiyā

(7)

uḍhata gulāla lāla bhaye bādala

keśara rańga me ghorī re rasiyā

(8)

candra sakhī bhaja bāla kṛṣṇa chavi

juga juga jiyo yaha jorī re rasiyā

**TRANSLATION**

1) Today is Holi here in Vraja. Come and join in the joyous festivities of Holi!

2) Come out from your homes, whether you are dark or fair, and join in the festivities!

3) From which village is this cowherd boy? And from which village is this fair Radha?

4) The cowherd boy is from Nandagrama And the fair Radha is from Varsana.

5) In whose hand is a golden squirtgun? And in whose hand is a pot of powder-dye?

6) In Kanhaiya’s hand is a golden squirtgun And in Radha’s hand is a pot of powder-dye

7) In great happiness Krsna is throwing the red colour everywhere, creating a cloud and the fair Radha is covered in it.

8) Candrasakhi worships the beautiful boy Krsna and may this Divine Couple live long, blissful lives
