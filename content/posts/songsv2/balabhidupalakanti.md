**TRANSLATION**

1) "May Mukunda, whose beautiful bodily complexion, anointed with vermilion, defeats the lustre of sapphires, splendidly increasing the beauty of king Cupid in the kingdom of Gandharvika's (Radhika's) body, fulfill the desires of my eyes!"

2) "May Mukunda, the splendor of whose face surpasses that of billions of rising moons, who is very lovely when He reaches childhood's end and enters into fresh adolescence, and who makes the hearts of Radhika and all Her girfriends oscillate along with the dangling of His earrings, fulfill the desires of my eyes!"

3) "May Mukunda, who wears a yellow dhoti, that shimmers even brighter than an heap of gold, on His buttocks, and above that a red sash which appears to be colored by the passionate love of His dearly beloved Sri Radhika, fulfill the desires of my eyes!"

4) "May Mukunda, who plays with Radha, who is surrounded by Her girlfriends, in Her beloved lake (Radhakunda), that has become more fragrant due to the nicely smelling flowers, in summer-evenings, by splashing Her in an erotically agitating way, fulfill the desires of my eyes!”

5) "O! May Mukunda, who immediately gets goose bumps of ecstasy all over His body as soon as He catches Gandharvika's (Radhika's) fragrance, and who then frantically smells the whole forest, that is delighted by this fragrance, fulfill the desires of my eyes!"

6) "May Mukunda, who places His staff-like arm on the shoulder of Kirtida's beautiful daughter, and who experiences great erotic happiness when He kisses Her cheeks, that are blossoming with a smile, fulfill the desires of my eyes!"

7) "May Mukunda, who is the fire of destruction for all the wild and proud demons, who is the embodiment of great affection for His parents in Vraja, and who is the presiding deity of the first (erotic) rasa for Sri Radhika, fulfill the desires of my eyes!"

8) "May Mukunda, who confides in soft-hearted Visakha, telling her about His suffering but who prays to arrogant Lalita with plaintive words in order to destroy the proud huff of love-anguished Sri Radha, fulfill the desires of my eyes."

9) "Sri Mukunda, the young prince of Vraja, will reveal Himself with His beloved Radha to anyone who anxiously recites these eight prayers to Mukunda and withdraws his senses from the sense-objects, counting him or her among the maidservants of His Priyaji Radhika!" Thus ends Srila Raghunatha dasa Gosvami's and Rupa Gosvami's Mukundastakam
