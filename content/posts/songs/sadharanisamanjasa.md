TRANSLATION


1)
The highest limits that the 
sthayi-bhava
 can attain
are fixed up according to different divisions of 
Krsna's

lovers. The girl 
Kubja
 of 
Mathura

and 
Krsna's
 16,000 Queens of 
Dvaraka

are examples of the 
bhavas
 known respectively as 
sadharani
 (the fickle love-infatuation felt by common
girls) and 
samanjasa
 (the consistent love felt by
wives). However, only the 
Vraja
 
gopis

can attain the advanced states of 
maha
- 
bhava
 known as 
rudha
 (advanced)
and 
adhirudha
 (highly advanced).


 


2)
The symptoms of 
rudha
 ecstasy are: intolerance of
separation even by the blinking of an eye, the churning of the hearts of
persons nearby, experiencing a millennium spent with Krsna to be like an
instant, experiencing an instant of separation from Krsna to be like a millennium,
feeling great pain in worrying about 
Krsna's

happiness, and forgetfulness of self-identity. All these 
anubhavas

of the 
rudha
 ecstasy can be experienced in both union
and separation.


 


3)
Now kindly hear of the two divisions of the 
adhirudha


maha-bhava
, known as 
modana

(divine pleasure) and 
madana
 (madly intoxicated
amorous exhilaration). In separation from Krsna, the 
modana

also becomes what in known as 
mohana
 (wonder-
struk
 astonishment) at a certain stage, thereby producing a
transcendental madness called 
divyonmada
.


 


4)
This 
divyonmada
 also has two divisions known as 1) 
citra-jalpa
 (various types of insane raving speech). 
and
 2) 
udghurna
 (uncontrollably
wonder-struck giddiness). After 
She
 relishes Her 
mohana
 state of wonder-struck astonishment, Sri 
Radha
 attains an even more essential condition called 
madana
, or madly intoxicated amorous exhilaration. This is
the summit of ecstasy that stimulates the flow of 
Her

eternal pastimes. 


 


5)
The 
sadharani
 lovers (common girls like 
Kubja
) have smoldering love. The 
samanjasa

lovers (consistent wives like the Queens of 
Dvaraka
)
have ignited love. The 
samartha
 lovers (the 
Vraja
 
gopis
) have burning
ecstasy; but above all of them, Sri 
Radha's
 loving
ecstasies are brilliantly blazing like the dazzling shimmer of pure gold, for
only in Her moods can one find these topmost brilliant ecstasies headed by 
modana
 and 
madana
.
