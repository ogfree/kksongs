TRANSLATION


1) O Krsna, appearing in the forms of
stone, metal, clay, wood, sand-drawings; jewels; and pictures, You temporarily
or permanently appear in Your deity-incarnation using these seven ways.


 


2) O Krsna, who also appears as the
Salagrama-sila, wherever or in whatever form You manifest Yourself, the
devotees worship You with great devotion.


 


3) O Krsna, I offer my obeisances to
You, whose form is eternal truth, knowledge, and bliss, and confirmed by Your
saintly devotees.
