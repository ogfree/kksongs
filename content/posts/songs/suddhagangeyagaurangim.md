TRANSLATION


1) O queen whose fair limbs
are more splendid than pure gold, O queen whose eyes are as charming as the
does' eyes, O queen whose face defeats millions of moons, O queen dressed in
garments as dark as monsoon clouds, . . .


 


2)
Â  
. . . O queen who is the crowning garland of 
mallika
 flowers on the decorated braided hair of the young 
gopis
, O queen whose beauty is served by many splendid
transcendental jewels and other ornaments,


 


3)
Â  
. . . O teacher of the intelligent and expert

gopis
, O queen elaborately decorated with a host of
transcendental virtues, O queen accompanied by Your eight very dear friends,


 


4)
Â  
. . . O queen who arouses Lord 
Kesava
 with the waves of Your restless sidelong glances, O
queen whose nectar 
bimba
 fruit lips have become the
food of the prince of 
Vraja
,


 


5)
Â  
. . . O queen of 
Vrndavana
,
bowing down and rolling about on the 
Yamuna's
 shore,
this person, with an agitated heart and a choked voice, appeals to 
You
.


 


6) Even though he has
committed offenses, even though he is unqualified, and even though his
intelligence is crooked, please give this person a small particle of 
Your
 devotional service.


 


7) Because the fresh butter
of 
Your
 heart is always melting in the splendor of
Your transcendental mercy, it is not proper for You to neglect this anguished
person.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â
