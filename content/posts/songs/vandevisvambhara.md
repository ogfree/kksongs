TRANSLATION


1)
I offer prayers to the lotus feet of 
Visvambhara
, who
cuts away the defective consciousness of those who are influenced by Kali-
yuga
.


 


2)
With the fragrance of His supremely sweet philosophy, name, qualities, etc., 
Mahaprabhu
 attracts His honeybee-like followers. By His
causeless mercy, He removes the anguish of separation of His dear associates
(like 
Advaita
 
Acarya
). 


 


3)
For a long time the hearts of the 
jivas
 in this world
have been afflicted with ignorance due to 
maya
, which
He instantly destroys with His brilliant effulgence.


 


4)

Radha-mohana
, having become greatly attracted to 
Mahaprabhu
 whose unmatched splendor is always radiating
out, is broadcasting His glories to all.
