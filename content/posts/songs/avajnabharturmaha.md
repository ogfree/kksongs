TRANSLATION


1-2) "My friend
ignored terrible punishment from Her husband, disobeyed the angry words of Her
superiors, pushed aside the maidservant blocking Her exit, chanted O 
Hari
, O 
Krsna
, O Lord, ignored
all disgrace, and prepared to go into the dangerous night filled with blinding
darkness, thundering clouds, and torrential rains. 


 


3-4) "She happily went
to the noisy boundary of the jungle, where not far away were many jumping,
fighting monkeys, slithering snakes with raised hoods, and fearful, howling
owls. She entered a beautiful cottage of flowering vines and, eager, simple and
pure-
hearted,
 She cut many flowers with Her
fingernails and made for You a bed as white as foam.


 


5) "
Mukunda
, looking for You, Her eyes remained always fixed on
the path. Her desire for 
You
 ever new and unfading,
when She could not attain You She became very unhappy, severely wounded by the
flower-arrows of 
Kama
.
Â Â Â  


 


6) "Again and again
saying, 'O sweet-talking rogue,' and thinking each moment a 
kalpa
,
my bewildered friend stayed awake all night, alone in the forest grove where
She could not attain Her desire. 


 


7) "Today we are
fortunate. You have suddenly come from far away to this home. O 
Murari
, by seeing 
Your
 blissful
form, the eyes of the 
gopis
 become showered with
transcendental happiness.


 


8) "I think that, 
sseing
 the great splendor of Your yellow silk garments, and
becoming envious, Your garland of jasmine flowers, stealing the splendid 
kuÃ¬kuma
 from some girl's breasts, has now made itself
yellow.


 


9) "Your sleepy face
is decorated with locks of disheveled hair. It is very handsome in this state
of complete exhaustion. Your body is decorated with many fingernail scratches
and its fragrant ointments are broken. It must have performed the 
kama-yajna
 


 


10) "Whom will Your
red, black mascara marked, 
bimba
 fruit lips, which
rival in glory a black bee touching a blossoming 
bandhujiva

flower, not fill with splendid happiness? 


 


11) "O playful Lord,
what is the need of this solemn declaration that 
You

speak the truth? I know that 
You
 eternally love 
Radhika
. O lover of the 
gopis
,
please quickly leave my doorstep and allow the sun to rise on the dark night of
my anguish."


 


12) May Lord 
Hari
, who wears a necklace of jewels, and who, hearing
these words of love from 
Radhika's
 friend, found
boundless satisfaction, grant my greatest desire.


 


13-17) "His eyes
shooting arrows of love, the peacock feather on His head moving, His body
fragrant, His flute 
musi
 removing the anguish the 
gopis
 feel in separation from Him, bringing happiness to
His mother, making the entire world mad with love for Him, O friend, merciful,
making the hearts of all young girls tremble, O honest girl, holding a rope in
His hand, supremely happy at the end of the day, O girl with water pot breasts,
splendidly smiling, mocking the 
atasi
 flower with His
bodily luster, overwhelming the doves, submissive to they who love Him,
shark-shaped earrings moving on His handsome ears, accompanied by His friends, 


maddening
 the demigoddesses, bewildering the bees,
accompanied by how many peacocks, and with His gentle footsteps splendidly
decorating the pathways of 
VrajabhÃ¼mi
 and delighting
the earth, Lord 
Hari
 has now entered the courtyard,
and You, O beautiful girl, are now overcome with happiness.


 


18) "Don't speak
harshly! Don't be angry at heart! Go and enjoy pastimes with Him! When the
moon, with its light as cool as snow, has risen, what girl will not
passionately worship her beloved?


 


19) "Look! The
splendidly dressed young 
gopis
 are running to Him.
Lord 
Hari
 now places His glance upon 
You
. Lovingly place 
Your
 feet on
the path to Him."


 


20) May Lord 
Hari
, to whom 
Lalita
 forcibly
brought her friend averse with jealous anger, instructing 
Her

with these words, bring transcendental auspiciousness to you.
