LYRICS:


(1)


When I
found myself in times of trouble, Prabhupada comes to me,


Speaking
words of wisdom: Hari Bol!


And in
my hour of darkness He is standing right in front of me,


Speaking
words of wisdom - let it be.


 


Chant
your rounds Chant your rounds


Chant
your rounds Sixteen Rounds


Whispered
words of wisdom: Hari Bol!


 


(2)


And
when the broken hearted people living in the world agree,


There
will be an answer Hari Bol!


For
thought they maybe parted,


There
is still a change that they will see


There
will be an answer: Hari Bol!


 


Chant
your rounds Chant your rounds


Chant
your rounds Sixteen Rounds


Whispered
words of wisdom: Hari Bol!


 


(3)


And
when the night is cloudy, there is still a light that shines on me


Shines
until tomorrow - let it be.


I wake
up to the sound of japa, Prabhupada still comes to me,


Speaking
words of wisdom - let it be.


 


Chant
your rounds Chant your rounds


Chant
your rounds Chant your rounds


There
will be an answer: Hari Bol!


 


Chant
your rounds Chant your rounds


Chant
your rounds Sixteen Rounds


Whispered
words of wisdom: Hari Bol!
