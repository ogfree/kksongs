TRANSLATION


1)
O Jagannatha, I ask nothing from You - neither wealth, neither followers. I
aamm only asking for one forearm's length of land at Saradha Bali.


 


2)
My eyes want nothing other than to see Your beautiful form. My ears want
nothing other than to hear the recitation of Your songs.


 


3)
Neither by day or night does this tongue want to sing mundane songs. O
Pitavasa, O Lord Jagannatha, who wears yellow garments, chanting Your holy name
is my only last hope.


 


4)
My nose is not interested in the smells of this world. It only wants to relish
the fragrance of Your prasadi-garlands, tulasi, flowers, sandalwood paste and
camphor.


 


5)
O Rama Vanamali, O Flute-playing Krsna, who gives pleasure to His devotees, my
fingers want only to be engaged in the japa of 'Hare Krsna'. Salabega, of
lowborn caste, pleads to give up his body in the holy land of Jagannatha Puri.


 


REMARKS/EXTRA
INFORMATION:


Verse
1 describes Â“Saradha Bali.Â” It is the forearm's length of land is just enough
space to sit down. Saradha Bali is where the Lord's chariot waits near Gundica
between the two Rathayatras.


 


This
song was also translated by Gopala Jiu and printed in the fourth issue of Sri
Krishna Kathamrita magazine entitled, "The Confidential Meaning of
Ratha-yatra".
