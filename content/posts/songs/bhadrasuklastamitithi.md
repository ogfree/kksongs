TRANSLATION


1) On the eighth day of the bright half of 
Bhadra
-month,
on the day of the 
Visakha
-constellation, 
Srimati's
 birth 
occured
. The sun,
having traveled to mid-day and seeing the splendor of the baby girl, said
"
Jaya
 
Jaya
" in
great delight.


 


(2)


In the town of 
Vrsabhanu
, in each and every
house, "
Jaya
 
Radhe
,
Sri 
Radhe
" was said. Seeing the moon-face of the
daughter, the king became most happy and gave in charity to all 
brahmanas
.


 


(3) He gave different ingredients to the hands of all the ladies of the
village, as they assembled at 
Kirtida's
 temple.
"As the fruit of so much piety, with the 
godspeed
 of destiny, such a baby girl has been given
to you!


 


(4) "We are thinking that she is not an ordinary human at all --
who has taken birth in this disguise?" 
Ghanasyama


Das
 says, "Have no doubt of it, she will always
be dear to Krsna!"
