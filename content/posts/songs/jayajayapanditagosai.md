TRANSLATION


1)
All glories, all glories to 
Gadadhara
 
Pandit
 by Whose mercy we can sing Sri 
Caitanya's

glories.


 


2)
His love is such that 
Gauranga
 is celebrated as `
Gadadhara's
 
prananatha
' (the Lord
of 
Gadadhara
). 
Aho
! As 
Gadadhara's
 life is 
Gauranga
, His

prema
 is unfathomable -for He renounced his 
ksetra
 
sannyasa
 and 
Gopinatha's
 
seva
 simply for 
Gaura
. 


 


3-4)
Thus 
Gauranga
 belongs to Him, and He belongs to 
Gaura
 -as 
Rama
 and 
Sita
 are one body. And just as 
Radha

and 
Vrndavana
 
candra
 are
one life - so do the waves of 
prema
 capsize from 
Gaura
 and 
Gadadhara's
 
lila
. Thus 
Sivananda
 says: `
Krsna
 eagerly discards his 
syama

body and becomes 
Gauranga
 simply to beg for 
Radharani's
 
prema
!"
