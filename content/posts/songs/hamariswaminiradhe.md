TRANSLATION


Refrain) My All in all is
my Precious 
Radha
 
Rani
. She
alone is our eternal Mistress and She is our ever 
worshippable

goddess and Divine Consort.


 


1) 
Srimati


Radhika
, the darling Daughter of King 
Vrishbhanu
, is always youthful. Her natural, simple, sweet,
innocent Personality is the mine of Divine Love and the treasure-house of
Divine Bliss.


 


2) The Blessed village of 
Varsana
 is our eternal Abode and the enchanting Divine 
Vrindavana
 is privileged to become the Royal Capital for
Amorous pastimes.


 


3) Along with Her intimate
eternal Associates and their groups of unlimited playmate 
Sakhis
,
Sri 
Radhaji
, continuously rains down the torrential
currents of Bliss of 
Prema
 Rasa, according to Her
loving moods and ecstasies.


 


4) In that Land of Love,
only one sound is ever echoing, the mantra of "
Radhe
!

Radhe
! 
Radhe
!
",
 as the sacred palm trees, dark 
tamala

trees and delicious mango trees, absorbed in their 
meditational

trance, chanting loudly the Divine Name of their Beloved.


 


5) When Sri 
Radhika
 visits the enchanting garden bowers of 
Vrindavana
, seated on a golden throne and carried by Her
loving servants, the Supreme Personality of Godhead walks in front of the
procession recounting with pride, Her unlimited Glories to all. 


 


6) Overwhelmed with Love,
just by looking at His Soul, Sri 
Radha
, Lord Krishna
surrenders Himself totally to Her incomprehensible charms and Her
inconceivable, fathomless Divine Love and 
Krpalu
 
dasa
 loudly proclaims in spiritual ecstasy, "All
glories to My great Queen, all glories to My 
Radha
 
Rani
!"
