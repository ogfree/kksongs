TRANSLATION


(Refrain)
O beautiful girl! Restrain Your crooked glances! It is like a bait to catch the
fish (of My mind) in the net! This is really a terrible situation!


 


1)
Just as a fish in a river may be so terrified of a 
Makara

(sea-monster) that it jumps out of the river into a shore coast, similarly the
fish of My mind is so terrified of Cupid (who rides on a 
Makara
-vehicle)
that it shivers and leaves the river of Your necklace to jump into Your heart.


 


2)
Again he jumps, in great agitation, elsewhere - in the lake of Your navel. But
there he is afraid of the company of the snake-like hairs that dwell there, so
he flees again into the lake of 
Your
 three-lined
belly, that resembles the 
Triveni
 (the confluence of
the 
Yamuna
, 
Ganga
 and 
Sarasvati
).


 


3)
"Here he wanders around agitated by so many desires. Alas! Here the
fisherman Cupid has extended his net to catch him, in the form of Her waist
bells. 
Govinda
 
dasa
 doubts
whether he can be saved!
