TRANSLATION


1) O Krsna, O Supreme
Personality of Godhead appearing as an ordinary cowherd boy, in the ocean of
nectar which is the prayer of Lord Brahma, Your glorious spiritual form was
beyond the power of Lord Brahma to comprehend.


 


2) O Krsna, You cannot be
touched by those who waste their time with the false theories of the 
impersonalists
. You are easily conquered only by those
engaged in 
Your
 devotional service. Those fools who
remain indifferent tot eh supremely auspicious path of devotional service to 
You
 experience only distress for all their efforts.


 


3) O Krsna, many liberated
souls have attained You by taking shelter of Your devotional service, O Lord,
You are very amazing and very difficult to understand, full of unlimited
exalted transcendental qualities, and beyond the modes of material nature.


 


4) O Krsna, Your merciful
side-long glance causes liberation from the bonds of material existence.
Although 
You
 present a frightening aspect to the
offender, when Your son appeals to You, You become and indulgent.


 


5) O Krsna, millions of
universes emanate from the pores of 
Your

transcendental body. O father and mother of the universe, just as mother
tolerates the offenses of her children 
You
 tolerate
the offenses of the living entities.


 


6) O Krsna, You are the
resting place of all living beings and Lord Brahma is born from the lotus
flower growing from 
Your
 navel. Although 
You
 are the mother from whose womb the five material
elements were born, by Your glance You show the unreality and temporariness of
this material world.


 


7) Your own pastimes are
not understandable (by the non-devotees) and 
You
 are
full of all power and opulence. You are the source of the spiritual reality and
well as the illusory material existence and 
You
 are
the eternal supreme truth.


 


8) O Krsna, You may be seen
by the mercy of the spiritual master, and it is forgetfulness of 
You
 which causes the entanglement in material existence.
Simply by thinking 
You
 create the illusory states of
material bondage and impersonal liberation.


 


9) O Krsna, if 
Your
 devotee abandons all illusory material conceptions, You
appear within his heart, and also externally before him. You bestow the mercy
of 
Your
 lotus feet to those who teach Your glories to
others.


 


10) O Krsna, You greatly
blessed Lord Brahma, who appealed for the service of 
Your

servants, and who sang the glories of Your devotional service with his four
mouths. O Lord, please protect me.
