LYRICS:


(1)


How
how how how how how how how can it be?


It is
true It is true It is true It is true It is true 


But
but but but but what does it mean Â“Will you


Please
tell tell tell tell tell the answer to me?.Â”


 


(2)


It has
baffled the greatest of sages Now they cannot see


The
deep deep deep deep deep secret truth. Do a few


Or do
ten or do five or do four or do three or do two,


Or do
even one wise saintly sage know the truthÂ¿ What should we


 


(3)


Think
Â“Why why why does the master the ruler of all 


Of the
stars and the worlds and the devas and men, laughing dance


In the
flower-filled forest?Â” Â“Why why does He call


The
surabhi cows with His flute?Â” Â“Why why does He glance


 


(4)


In Sri
Radhika's eyes?Â” Â“Why why why why does He tease


Vraja's
beautiful lotus-eyed girls?Â” Â“Will you tell me please?Â”
