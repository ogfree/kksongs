TRANSLATION


1) O
brothers! Madhavendra Puri Prabhu sometimes honored prasad in the courtyard of
Mother Saci. While eating and eating he would become overwhelmed by symptoms of
ecstatic love of God. Once he addressed the renunciates who were accompanying
him, "O assembled sannyasis! Just listen to this:


 


2)
"Mother Saci has cooked many varieties of prasad, such as semi-solid
delicacies made with banana flower, a special dahl preparation, baskets of
fruits, small square cakes made of lentils and cooked-down milk, among others.
Seeing her pure devotion, Lord Krsna personally ate all these preparations,
which are just like nectar.


 


3)
"O brothers! All the results that the mystic yogis obtain by the diligent
practice of yoga will be obtained today by taking these remnants of the Lord.
Everyone come and eat the prasad of Lord Hari and shout His holy name! The
three worlds are made glorious by the presence of the food-grains left by Lord
Krsna. Even Lord Tripurari (Lord Siva) dances in great joy on obtaining that
prasad.Â”


 


REMARKS/EXTRA
INFORMATION:


Prasad
at Mother Saci's is confirmed in the 
Caitanya-caritamrta, Madhya Lila Chapter 9 Verses 295 through
298
.
