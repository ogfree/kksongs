TRANSLATION


1) May the priests, who
resemble 
Agni
, ascend the same chariot as You, O 
Manyu
, who is accompanied by the 
Maruts
.
May 
You
 proceed in battle, advancing, exulting, indignant,
armed with sharp arrows, whetting Your weapons.


 


2) Blazing like fire, O 
Manyu
, overcome our foes, come as our general, when invoked
by us in battle. Having slain the enemies, divide their wealth. Granting us
strength, scatter our foes. 


 


3) O 
Manyu
,
overthrow our enemies. Advance against our foes, wounding, killing,
annihilating them. O You who 
depend
 on no-one, who can
resist Your fierce might?


 


4) You are praised, O 
Manyu
, as the conqueror of all. Help us contend with all
men. With 
You
 as our friend, O radiant one, we cry out
in victory.


 


5) O 
Manyu
,
giver of victory, 
You
 are irreproachable like Lord 
Indra
. Please protect this sacrifice. O Enduring One, we
sing to you appropriate praises. We know this to be the source where 
You
 have come from.


 


6) O 
Manyu
,
You are like a destructive thunderbolt, the one who overpowers foes, the twin
brother of victory and have extreme strength. Be favorable to us, 
Manyu
, in our deeds, O You who are invoked by many in the
shock of battle.


 


7) May 
Manyu

and 
Varuna
 bestow upon us undivided spiritual and
material wealth; may our enemies, fear within their hearts, be overcome and
utterly destroyed.


 


REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:




Manyu
 is a form of Lord 
Nrsimha
, the personification
and presiding Deity of anger.
