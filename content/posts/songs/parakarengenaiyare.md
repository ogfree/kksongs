TRANSLATION


1)
Worship 
Kanhaiya
, the brother of 
Balarama
.

Kanhaiya's
 lotus feet are the boat to take us across
the ocean of material life.


 


2)
Worship 
Kanhaiya
, that 
Krsna

who stays in 
Vraja
, playing the flute and from every 
gopi's
 house steals the butter (that is, the soft and pure
white hearts that are like butter).


 


3)
Worship 
Kanhaiya
, that 
Krsna

who lifted 
Govardhana
 Hill and performed the 
rasa-lila
. His lotus feet are the boat to take us across
the ocean of material life.


 


4)
When his friend 
Sudama
 brought Him some low-grade
rice, He accepted it, embraced him and cried, "O My brother, you haven't
come for such a long time! Where have you been? Did you forget Me?"
Worship that 
Krsna
!


 


5)
In the Mahabharata war 
Syamaliya
 (sweet, black,
crooked 
Krsna
) became 
Arjuna's

chariot driver, directing the horses on the battlefield. He lifted 
Govardhana
 Hill at such a tender age and He subdued 
Kaliya
 
Naga
 by putting a rope
through his nose, dragging him out of the 
Yamuna
,
Worship that 
Krsna
!


 


6)
Worship that 
Kanhaiya
 who immediately came to protect

Draupadi's
 chastity by increasing her cloth
unlimitedly when she was surrounded by so many wicked men.
