TRANSLATION


1) O Goddess Ganga! You are the divine river from
heaven, you are the saviour of all the three worlds, you are pure and restless,
you adorn Lord ShivaÂ’s head. O Mother! may my mind always rest at your lotus
feet.


 


2) O Mother Bhagirathi! You give happiness to
everyone. The significance of your holy waters is sung in the Vedas. I am
ignorant and am not capable to comprehend your importance. O Devi! you are full
of mercy. Please protect me.


 


3) O Devi! Your waters are as sacred as
Â“CharanamritiÂ” of Sri Hari. Your waves are white like snow, moon and pearls.
Please wash away all my sins and help me cross this ocean of Samsara.


 


4) O Mother! those who partake of your pure
waters, definitely attain the highest state. O Mother Ganga! Yama, the Lord of
death cannot harm your devotees.


 


5) O Jahnavi! your waters flowing through the
Himalayas make you even more beautiful. You are BhishmaÂ’s mother and sage
JahnuÂ’s daughter. You are saviour of the people fallen from their path, and so
you are revered in all three worlds.


 


6) O Mother! You fulfill all the desires of the
ones devoted to you. Those who bow down to you do not have to grieve. O Ganga!
You are restless to merge with the ocean, just like a young lady anxious to
meet her beloved.


 


7) O Mother! those who bathe in your waters do not
have to take birth again. O Jahnavi! You are held in the highest esteem. You
destroy your devoteeÂ’s sins and save them from hell.


 


8) O Jahnavi! You are full of compassion. You
purify your devotees with your holy waters. Your feet are adorned with the gems
of IndraÂ’s crown. Those who seek refuge in you are blessed with happiness.


 


9) O Bhagavati! Take away my diseases, sorrows,
difficulties, sins and wrong attitudes. You are the essence of the three worlds
and you are like a necklace around the Earth. O Devi! You alone are my refuge
in this Samsara.


 


10) O Ganga! those who seek happiness worship you.
You are the source of happiness for Alkapuri and source of eternal bliss. Those
who reside on your banks are as privileged as those living in Vaikunta.


 


11) O Devi ! It is better to live in your waters
as turtle or fish, or live on your banks as poor Â“candalÂ” rather than to live
away from you as a wealthy king.


 


12) O Godess of Universe! You purify us. O
daughter of muni Jahnu! one who recites this Ganga Stotram
 
everyday, definitely
achieves success.


 


13) Those who have devotion for Mother Ganga,
always get happiness and they attain liberation. This beautiful and lyrical
Gangastuti is a source of Supreme bliss.


 


14) This Ganga Stotram, written by Sri Adi Sankaracharya,
devotee of Lord Siva, purifies us and fulfills all
 
our desires
 


 


REMARKS / EXTRA INFORMATION:


This song was featured in the 1996 Abhay Charan serial.
This song is not sung in traditional Gaudiya Vaisnava settings, however Ganga
is a devotee of the Lord. Adi
 
S
ankaracarya is also a devotee
of Lord Krsna, even though his philosophy preached impersonalism, by the behest
of Lord Krsna.
 Thus, this prayer is only there for the sake of posting
lyrics as a reference for the serial.
