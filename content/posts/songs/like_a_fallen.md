LYRICS


(1)


Like a
fallen demigod on the ground, Great Bhismadeva the name, lying on a bed of
arrows about to pass away


Krsna
and the five Pandavas came to the battlefield along with all great souls of the
universe they sorrowfully kneeled


 


(2)


Narada,
Vyasa, Sukadeva, and Lord Parsurama stood around the grandsire warrior and lay completely
calm


He
spoke to all the saints and kings and to Yuddhisthira, but Lord Sri Krsna is Supreme,
but most were unaware


 


(3)


The
beauty of Lord KrsnaÂ’s eyes beamed like the rising sun appeared before Great
Bhismadeva whose final hour had come


While
he instructed ruling laws unto King Yuddhisthira the sun ran its course into
the Northern Hemisphere.


 


(4)


At
such when mystics depart at their own will, and BhismaÂ’s pure desire was
finally fulfilled


Praying
to Lord Krsna, who advented on this earth, Bhisma showed how pure devotion
saves one from rebirth


 


(5)


He
thought of how Lord Krsna had traversed the battlefield, and how He tell the
shot of arrows to shatter KrsnaÂ’s shield


Taking
up the wheel, to protect His friend, Arjuna, Krsna challenged Bhisma just as
the final conch shell blew


 


(6)


At
last, Bhisma fixed his mind upon the Supersoul, and as his breathing stopped,
he attained the highest goal


Everyone
was silent like the birds at the end of day, while to the transcendental realm,
Great Bhisma passed away.
