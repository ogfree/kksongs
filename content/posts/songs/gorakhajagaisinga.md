TRANSLATION


1)
Hearing the sound of a buffalo-horn, the cowherd people awakened. Bringing some
alms, 
Jatila
, the mother of 
Abhimanyu
,

RadharaniÂ’s
 so-called husband, offered them to the
beggar. Disguised as a beggar-yogi, Lord Krishna, the master of all yoga, was
silent. He tilted His head. He would not accept the alms.


 


2)

Jatila
 said: Â“What do 
You
 want,
then?Â” The yogi said, Â“Your daughter-in-law should offer the alms with 
Her
 own hand. Only then will I accept them. Send for Her at
once.Â”


 


3)
Â“If I accept alms from you [and not from 
Srimati
 
Radharani
], then 
My
 yogiÂ’s vow
will perish.Â” Hearing these words, and the hairs of her body now standing
erect, 
Jatila
 ran to the side of her daughter-in-law.


 


4)

Jatila
 thought the supremely charming yogi at her
door must be a great sage. With great effort she gathered up some offerings.


 


5)
Hearing the commotion, beautiful 
Radha
 came. Â“I will
go to the yogi,Â” she said. 
Jatila
 affirmed, Â“This
yogi is not an ordinary man. Simply by seeing Him, one attains a great
spiritual treasure.Â”


 


6)
On the tray was an offering of whole-wheat flour and a golden cup with some ghee
in it. Taking the tray in 
Her
 hands, sighing with love
and Her lifeÂ’s breath trembling, 
Radha
 brought the
offering to the yogi 
Krishna
.


 


7)
The yogi 
Krishna
 said, Â“I will not accept this offering yet. First I
wish to hear a single word from 
Your
 mouth. I am 
NandaÂ’s
 arrogant son. Say that 
You

forgive Me, and then I will depart.Â”


 


8)
Hearing these words, beautiful 
Radha
 covered 
Her
 face with Her cloth. Then 
Krishna
, the king of dancers, took the alms. 
Govinda


Das
 says: His heartÂ’s mission accomplished, Lord
Krishna, the crown jewel of all dancers, took His leave.
