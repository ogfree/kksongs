TRANSLATION


1)
One day Lord 
Gaura
 suddenly thought in His heart:
Â“For the benefit of the people there, I will go east."


 


2)
Taking His closest companions with Him, Lord 
Gaura

would travel east. He who is 
mother
 
Saci's
 very life was restless to travel.


 


3)
To His mother Lord 
Gaura
 said: "Please don't
worry. I will always be near you."


 


4)
To 
Laksmipriya
 smiling Lord 
Gaura

said: "Serve My mother. Be devoted to her."


 


5)
Accompanied by His close companions, Lord 
Gaura
 began
His auspicious journey. With a happy heart He traveled.


 


6)

Brahmanas
 and saintly persons stayed on the bank of
the 
Padmavati
. Effulgent spiritual men 
an
 women bathed at the 
ghatas

there.


 


7)
When Lord 
Visvambhara
 bathed in the 
Padmavati
, everyone became freed of sins by bathing there.


 


8)
The people who lived in the east Lord 
Gaura
 begged to
accept the holy name. He gave them the chanting of Lord 
Krsna's

holy name.


 


9)
He did not consider who was pure or impure, or who had acted well or ill.
Everyone He carried to farther bank of the river of birth and death.


 


10)
Lord 
Gaura
 built a boat of 
nama-sankirtana

(chanting of the holy names). He personally begged everyone to enter that boat.
With that boat He brought them all to the farther bank of the river of birth
and death.


 


11)
Anyone who fled from Him, He caught in His arms. Lord 
Gauranga
,
who is Lord 
Krsna
 Himself, carried those persons to
the farther bank of the river of birth and death.


 


12)

Locana
 
dasa
 says: Lord 
Gaura
 is the master of all the worlds. Giving His mercy to
the people, He made them all pure at heart.
