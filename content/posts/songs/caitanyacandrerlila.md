TRANSLATION


1)
The essence of this narration is that no one can possibly have the power to
understand the unfathomable ocean of Lord Caitanya-Candra's transcendental
pastimes.


 


2)
The incomprehensible truth revealed in the scriptures is my Lord Sri Krsna. Who
has the power to understand the limit of His transcendental pastimes?


 


3)
So then why are foolish persons discussing and deliberating the revealed
scriptures? They are not reaching to the end due to the simple reason that they
have not accepted the transcendental pastimes of Lord Gauranga.


 


4)
Which scripture sings of the limit of the unlimited? I simply laugh when I hear
them say that Krsna is subordinate to and limited by the descriptions of the
sastra.


 


5)
The Supreme Lord Krsna has now become fair-complexioned, and according to His
own sweet will has descended along with His Vaikuntha abode in Navadvipa-dhama.


 


6)
When Krsna comes to deliver all the fallen souls, then all of His associates and
followers also come with Him to the surface of the earth.


 


7)
Along with His fair incarnation His own devotees Jaya and Vijaya have also
appeared in Navadvipa in the mood of being the enemy of the Lord.


 


8)
In many previous incarnations they had also been born as demons, but the
revealed scriptures say that they have taken birth in a brahmana family in
Gauranga-lila.


 


9)
The smrti scriptures say that they become absorbed in a fighting spirit with
Lord Gauracandra, manifesting enmity and hostility.


 


10)
Therefore it is a fact that all the residents of Navadvipa whether friendly or
inimical, are eternally nourishing the development of Lord Caitanya's pastime.


 


11)
I know that these enemies of Lord Caitanya, coming from brahmana background,
are actually assistants for giving nourishment to Lord Caitanya's pastime.


 


12)
I have thus prostrated myself at the lotus feet of all of the enemies as well
as friends who are accompanying Lord Caitanya during His lila.


 


13)
All of you eternal associates kindly show your mercy to this servant and please
make his devotion to Lord Caitanya become completely fixed up.
