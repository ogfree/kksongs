TRANSLATION


1) O
you have so much to say about being genuine! You are seen to be wrapped in an
old tattered blanket and wearing a simple loincloth, just like a renounced
ascetic, but in actuality all of this is simply pretentious. 


 


2)
Leaving your legally married wife at home, you go off and keep the company of
the wives of others. In your greed for acquiring more and more wealth, you
wander like a poor beggar from door to door, and you secretly keep so many
surpluses stored away.


 


3) You
are quite confident in presenting yourself as a saintly spiritual master, and
thus you are busily engaged in initiating innocent people by reciting
Krishna-nama into their ear -- is this behavior not a great charade? 


 


4) Can
anyone be called a "guru" simply because he gives advice to others? A
cook can never use whey in a recipe that calls for milk. Now think about this
and just see what I see.


 


5) On
the strength of the true qualities of peacefulness, sense control, and
tolerance, one's mundane desires are renounced as true spiritual faith arises.
That being the case, the renunciant Cand Baul says, "What will become of
your premature imitation of spiritual perfection?"
