TRANSLATION


1)
"I worship Sri Radhika, Whose beautiful eyes flicker in all directions
like restless playful wagtail birds, Who is the Malli-flower for the
honeybee-heart of the son of the cowherd king (Krsna) and Who is deep with all
attributes."


 


2)
"I worship Sri Radhika, Who spreads the fame of Her father Vrsabhanu
Maharaja's well thoughout the world and Who plays with Her girlfriends and the
prince of Vraja in Her own beautiful (or fragrant) pond."


 


3)
"I worship Sri Radhika, Whose smiling submissive face is initiated in a
vow to subdue the glories of the full autumnal moon (the lord of the lilies),
Whose erotic pastimes are expanded by Krsna's naughty side-long glances, and
Who wears waves of elegance on Her body."


 


4)
"I worship Sri Radhika, whose braided hair, which is filled with various
kinds of blooming flowers, resembles the spread out tail of a peacock that is
dizzy of amorous feelings, and whose spotless cheeks are coloured red with the
pan that emanated from Madhuripu's (Krsna's) mouth.Â”


 


5)
"I worship Sri Radhika, Whose heart is sprinkled by pure intimate
affection for Lalita, Whose all-round mood of friendship for Visakha is well
known, Who is a box filled with priceless jewels of love for Krsna and Who is
sweetly playful."


 


6)
"I worship Sri Radhika, Who was crowned (with a ceremonial bathing) as the
Queen of incomparably glorious Vrndavana, Who is the presiding goddess of the
Kartika month, which is the best time of the year, Who is the chief of all the
innumerable dear gopis of Mukunda, and whose fame destroys all the sins of the
world."


 


7)
"I worship Sri Radhika, Who looks upon even the backs of the extreme
borders of Hari's toe-nails as being dearer to Her than millions of hearts, who
is the guru who initiates all the joyful, restless-eyed girls in the art of
cleverness and whose glories are great."


 


8)
"I worship Sri Radhika, Whose luster is of pure gold, like vermillion
crushed on a golden slab, Whose adolescent beauty is surrounded by waves of
sweetness, Who gets goosepimples of ecstasy when She is embraced by Hari's
arms, and Who wears a bright crimson dress."


 


9)
"The moon of auspiciousness on the bank of the daughter of the sun
(Yamuna), Sri Krsnacandra, will be satisfied with whoever nicely recites this
best of prayers, Radhastakam, that is a spotless reservoir of erotic sweetness,
and He will fulfill all the reciter's desires."
