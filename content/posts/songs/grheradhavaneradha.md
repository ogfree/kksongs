TRANSLATION


1) Radha is in the home, Radha
is in the forest, and She is both behind and before me. I worship the
all-pervading Radhaji, wherever She is present.


 


2) Radha is on my tongue,
Radha is in my ears, Radha is in my eyes and inside my heart. I worship
Radhaji, who is within the bodies of all.


 


3) Radha is in my puja,
Radha is in my mantra-japa, Radha is in my prayers, Radha is in my memory, and
Radha is in my head Â– I worship that Radhaji.


 


4) Whenever I sing, I sing
about the qualities of Radha, everything I eat is RadhaÂ’s prasada, wherever I
go I always remember Radha, Radha is in the night, Radha is in the day Â– I
worship that Radhaji.


 


5) Radha is the sweetness
within anything that is sweet; of anything that is important, Radha is the most
important; and of everything that is beautiful, Radha is the supreme beauty Â– I
worship that Radhaji.


 


6) Radha is an ocean of
nectarean rasa, Radha is the flower-bud of all good fortune, Radha is the
foremost gopi of Vraja Â– I worship that Radhaji.


 


7) Because RadhaÂ’s face is
like a spotless lotus flower, She is known as Padma. She is worshiped by Brahma
who appeared on the lotus emanating from VisnuÂ’s navel, and when She was first
discovered by Her father, She was resting upon a lotus Â– I worship that
Radhaji.


 


8) Radha is eternally
immersed in Sri Krsna, Krsna is certainly always immersed in Radha, and Radha
is the queen of Vrndavana Â– I worship that Radhaji.


 


9) RadhaÂ’s name is on the
tip of my tongue, RadhaÂ’s beautiful form is always before my eyes, descriptions
of RadhaÂ’s fame are always in my ears, and Radha always resides in my mind.


 


10) Whoever regularly
recites with great care this prayer spoken by Sri Krsna will attain loving
service for the feet of Sri Radha-Krsna.


 


11) Srimati Radhika
worships Sri Krsna in Her heart and mind, and Krsna worships Srimati Radhika in
His heart and mind; Sri Krsna attracts RadhikaÂ’s heart and mind, and Radhika
attracts KrsnaÂ’s heart and mind. Whoever lovingly recites this prayer will
become similarly attracted to the lotus feet of Sri Radha-Krsna.
