LYRICS:


(1)


HeÂ’s
walking through the dead of night, he reached ArjunaÂ’s camp


AsvatthamaÂ’s
wicked mind was filled with cruel intent


To
kill DraupadiÂ’s sleeping sons, he raised his sharpened knife


And
one and by one by heinous act, each son gave us his life.


 


(2)


The
beating heart of Arjuna said, Â“His act was of surely low.Â”


The
blazing eyes of copper fire, he took his vengeful vow


To
pacify DraupadiÂ’s grief, Arjuna then declared


That
you shall take a bath upon this AsvatthamaÂ’s head.


 


(3)


As
Krsna reigned the horses in, Arjuna took his stand


With
binding speeds, their chariots soon sped across the land


AsvatthamaÂ’s
beating heart was filled with deadly fear


To see
Arjuna from afar, Krsna, his charioteer.


 


(4)


As his
horses tired with no escape, Arjuna close in hand


Asvatthama
understood he had to make a stand


He
then released the blazing arrow of great veracity


While
chanting hymns for throwing weapons of nuclear energy


 


(5)


The
heat of this radiation spread out everywhere


The
son of the Drona didnÂ’t know how to retract the glare


Arjuna
understood from Krsna what he had to do


How to
counteract the weapon Asvatthama threw


 


(6)


Once
heÂ’s cast his weapons forth by the power of mantraÂ’s sound


The
burning rays of both brahmastras fiercely ends the ground


Standing
forth scorching fire far into outer space


Annihilation
of the planets was destined to take place


 


(7)


Arjuna
being expert in the military field


At
once, heÂ’s retracted both brahmastras the fire was concealed


The
all ends in a war of some five thousand years ago


Asvatthama
surrendered to Arjuna's Gandiva bow
