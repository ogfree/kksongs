TRANSLATION


1) O Rama,
Who was constantly remembered by Hanuman, the best among the apemen! O Rama,
Who destroyed the obstacles in His way! O Rama, Who is the sustainer of life of
Sita! O Rama, Who the evil rogue, Ravana, made false statements about.


 


2) O Rama,
Who was praised by the wise Hanuman! O Rama, Who was presented by Sita as (Her)
protector from Jayanta disguised as a crow (the son of Indra)! O Rama, Who was
shown the cudamani (hair-piece) of Sita (by Hanuman)! O Rama, Who was comforted
by the words of Hanuman, the best Apeman!
