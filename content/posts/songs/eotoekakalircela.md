TRANSLATION


1)
Here is just another disciple of Kali-yuga! He keeps his head shaved, wears a
loincloth, tilak on his nose and tulasi beads around his neck.


 


2) By
looks he appears to be a Vaisnava, but in actuality his conduct is that of a
sakta, one who worships the principle of material energy in order to enjoy her.
He engages in sahaja-bhajan (so-called "natural worship"), but does
so by posing as "uncle" to the children of others, and then
stealthily taking the illicit association of their daughters.


 


3)
Accepting these young girls as sakhis (Radha's gopi friends), he fancies
himself to be the Son of Nanda. By the deceptive lecturing about how everyone
should become Krsna-dasa (the servant of himself as "Krsna"), this
disciple of Kali-yuga thus hurls a sharp spear at the true devotees of the
Lord.


 


4)
Giving artificial recognition to nava-rasika (the nine relishers), he thus eats
and enjoys the bananas of his own mental fabrications. Cand Baul says, "O
my dear brothers! Desist from this bogus imitation of the Lord's amorous
sports."
