LYRICS:

hari
hari! biphale janama gońāinu

manuṣya-janama pāiyā, rādhā-kṛṣṇa
nā bhajiyā,

jāniyā śuniyā biṣa khāinu


 


(2)


golokera
prema-dhana, hari-nāma-sańkīrtana,

rati nā janmilo kene tāy

saḿsāra-biṣānale, dibā-niśi hiyā jwale,

jurāite nā koinu upāy


 


(3)


brajendra-nandana
jei, śacī-suta hoilo sei,

balarāma hoilo nitāi

dīna-hīna jata chilo, hari-nāme uddhārilo,

tāra śākṣī jagāi mādhāi

tomā bine ke āche āmāra


 


WORD
FOR WORD TRANSLATION: 
Hari
Hari Biphale Janama Gonainu


 


TRANSLATION



1)
O Lord Hari I have spent my life uselessly. Having obtained a human birth and
having net worshiped Radha and Krsna, I have knowingly drunk poison. 


 


2)
The treasure of divine love in Goloka Vrndavana has descended as the
congregational chanting of Lord Hari's holy names. Why did my attraction for
that chanting never come about? Day and night my heart burns from the fire of
the poison of worldliness, and I have not taken the means to relieve it. 


 


3)
Lord Krsna, who is the son of the King of Vraja, became the son of Saci (Lord
Caitanya), and Balarama became Nitai. The holy name delivered all those souls
who were lowly and wretched. The two sinners Jagai and Madhai are evidence of
this. 


 


4)
O Lord Krsna, son of Nanda, accompanied by the daughter of Vrsabhanu, please be
merciful to me now. Narottama Dasa says, "O Lord, please do not push me
away from Your reddish lotus feet, for who is my beloved except for You?"
