TRANSLATION


1)
O Madana Gopala, please place Your lotus feet, which are marked with a
thunderbolt, lotus, conch shell, water pot, and fish, which eclipse all
splendors, and which with soft soles have conquered Vrndavana forest, in my
heart. Please protect me, for I am now Your home.


 


2)
With every step splendid garlands of the cooling moonlight of Your
toenail-moons and the words of Your talkative anklets bring happiness to the
path of my ears, eyes, and breath. O Madana Gopala, please protect me, for I am
now Your home.


 


3)
O Madana Gopala, as You plunge me in the sweetness of the glittering golden
earrings at Your cheeks, in the tilt of Your jeweled crown, and in the
handsomeness of Your expertly moving restless eyes, please protect me, for I am
now Your home.


 


4)
You place a flute on the red of Your lips, which are worshipped by the splendor
of Your smile and decorated with the effulgence of teeth that defeat the
splendour of rubies. O Madana Gopala, whose pastimes cannot be understood by
the people, please protect me, for I am now Your home.


 


5)
You are splendid with golden earrings, many necklaces and garlands, dancing
anklets and bracelets, and many other jewel ornaments, which are themselves
decorated by the splendour of Your form. O Madana Gopala, please protect me, for
I am now Your home.


 


6)
O Madana Gopala, with Your merciful glances, which are arbors of millions of
celestial desire-trees, with the new blossoms of the splendor of Your face,
which eclipses millions of moons, and with the kandala flowers of Your hands,
which have nails to attack millions of Kamadevas, please protect me, for I am
now Your home


 


7)
O Madana Gopala, who appeared in a humanlike form and was served by Siva and
all the demigods, O merciful one, who showed the Earth eternal spiritual love,
please protect me, for I am now Your home.


 


8)
On the Yamuna's shore is a shady kadamba grove and a glorious jewel palace
where You eternally play with Radha and Lalita. O Madana Gopala, please protect
me, for I am now Your home.


 


9)
Into the nectar lake of love for Your lotus feet You quickly plunge a sincere
devotee who reads these eight nectar verses glorifying You. O Madana Gopala,
please protect me, for I am now Your home.
