TRANSLATION


1) O Lord 
Krsna
, all glories unto 
You
, who are full of all eternal transcendental
characteristics and 
opulences
. (As 
Akrura
 
travelled
 to 
Vrndavana
), he meditated upon the great multitude of 
Your
 glories, and also upon Your lotus eyes.


 


2) O Lord 
Krsna
, You increased the
devotional bliss of 
Akrura
, who was engaged in
meditating upon 
Your
 lotus feet. 
Akrura

arrived in 
Vrndavan
 by chariot at the time for
milking the cow.


 


3) O Lord 
Krsna
, all glories unto 
You
. 
Akrura
, the son of 
Svaphalka
 became jubilant when he saw 
Your

footprints on the earth, and he began to roll about on the ground, taking the
dust from Your lotus feet. It was then that 
Akrura

got the opportunity to see 
You
.


 


4) O Lord 
Krsna
, all glories unto 
You
. When 
Akrura
, the son of 
Svaphalka
 saw 
You
, his eyes became
full of bliss and he jumped down from his chariot to offer 
obeisances

unto You.


 


5) O Lord 
Krsna
, all glories unto 
You
. You lovingly embraced 
Akrura
,
the son of 
Gandini-devi
, and 
You

completely fulfilled all the desires within his mind, because You are very
affectionate to the devotees who offer respect to You.
