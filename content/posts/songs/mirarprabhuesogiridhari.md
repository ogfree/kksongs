TRANSLATION


(Refrain):
The beautiful 
Syama
 is the Lord of 
Mirabai
. Please come to me, 
Giridhari
!


 


1)
My heart, which is like the 
Jamuna
 River is
restricted by its two banks, is now overflowing with divine love for 
You
.


 


2)
The 
kadamba
 tree of my mind is blooming with flowers
that sway to and fro on the waves of divine love. O 
Hari
,
please come and play Your flute. You are the life and soul of Sri 
Radhika
.


 


3)

Mirabai
 says, Â“For Your sake, O 
Syama
,
I gave up my home, and I have also given up my own family. In the same way that
the 
gopis
 of 
Vraja
 cried
out of separation from You, I also cry as Your loving devotee. Please keep this
prayer of Your most unfortunate Mira at Your lotus feet and disregard my false
pride.
