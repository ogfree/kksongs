TRANSLATION


(Refrain) Glory, glory to
the Lord who is 
Radha's
 lover, the Lord who is like a
trap to catch the eyes of the world's people, the Lord who is like a moon
shining in 
Vrndavana
!


 


1) His form glistens like a
dark new rain cloud. A peacock-feather crown adorns His head. His garments are
golden. His ornaments are made of jewels. His anklets jangle.


 


2) His graceful eyes are
two blue lotus flowers. The restless glances from His eyes' corners are arrows
of flowers, arrows that wound the saintly 
gopis
'
amorous hearts.


 


3) A forest-flower garland
hangs to His knees. Its fragrance makes the black bees wild with bliss. Placing
the flute to His 
bimba
-fruit lips, 
Govinda
 
dasa's
 master plays
enchanting melodies. 


 


REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:


This
song is sung in Raga Sri.
