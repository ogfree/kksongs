TRANSLATION


1) When will Sri 
Rupa
 
Manjari
 speak to me with
such sweet words in a private place, vividly explaining to me the
transcendental glories of Sri 
Radha-kunda
?


 


2) "Beyond these
fourteen worlds is the spiritual abode of the 
Vaikuntha

planets. And beyond that, the area known as 
Mathura

is the topmost and supreme abode."


 


3) "Within that 
Mathura-mandala
, the place known as 
Vrndavana

is best of all, for that is where the 
rasa-lila
 takes
place. Please hear me now as I narrate these glories."


 


4) "Out of all the
places in 
Vrndavana
 where 
Krsna

performs His pastimes, the place known as 
Govardhana

is best. And the best place in 
Govardhana
 is 
Radha
 
kunda
, which possesses all
transcendental potencies."


 


5) Whenever I hear the
glories of this sacred 
Radha-kunda
, I become sized
with such an eager yearning that I will swoon and fall down on the spot.


 


6) When will I ever become
so intensely eager for the lotus feet of a 
sakhi
,
which will make her so obliged to me that she will mercifully bestow upon me
permanent situation in my own natural eternal mellow?
