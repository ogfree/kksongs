REMARKS/EXTRA
INFORMATION:


Lord
Nityananda Prabhu originally chanted the refrain of this song.


 


This
is typically sung in the Bengali morning raga.


 


The
alternate for the second line is the refrain is Â“
je jan āmār gaura bhaje, sei hoy
āmār prāṇ re
.Â”


 


There
are additional verses that are sung in bhajan style that follow the refrain.
The translation and transliteration of the verses would be greatly appreciated.
