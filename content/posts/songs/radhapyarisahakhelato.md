TRANSLATION


1)

Nanda
 
Dulal
 plays with His
dear 
Radha
. Their succulent forms, that resemble
emeralds and gold, are both red.


 


2)
Their bodies are beautified by splendid reddened garments, and They wear
strings of red pearls and gems. On top of 
Krsna's

dancing turban is a peacock feather and this plus 
Radharani's

veil is colored pink.


 


3)
They both carry 
abira
 in Their hands and strew it
over Each other's bodies. They also squirt colored water over Each other
through syringes. The 
Yamuna
 is red, the 
kunja-vanas
 (grove-woods) on the bank of the 
Yamuna
 are red and the string of young girls of 
Vraja
 is also red.


 


4)
The trees are red, the vines and flowers are red and the string of bees within
them are also red. The Sari and 
Suka
-parrots are red,
the peacocks and the cuckoos are red and 
Uddhava
 
dasa
 sings this tasty song.
