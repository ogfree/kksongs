TRANSLATION


1)
Accompanied by a young 
gopi
-friend, a beautiful girl
goes to meet 
Krsna
. A hundred-petal lotus flower
decorates 
Her
 left ear. She defeats 
Kamadeva
, who holds a bow of flowers in his hand.


 


2)
She is decorated with red 
sindura
. She is effulgent
like the sun. She is gracefully marked with sandal-paste dots. Shyly she
watches. She hides by a pond. She is slender like a crescent-moon grown more
and more slender after many days.


 


3)
She is graceful with ivory ornaments. She is so beautiful 
She

defeats 
Kamadeva
. Anklets adorn 
Her

feet. Her face is enchanting. Her jingling ornaments defeat 
Rati
.


 


4)
She meets with 
Lalita
 and Her other friends. A joyful
tumult arises. She yearns to taste the nectar of gazing on dark 
Krsna
. She and 
Krsna
 gaze at each
other. The hairs of 
Their
 bodies stand erect with joy.
This 
Govinda
 
dasa
 says.
