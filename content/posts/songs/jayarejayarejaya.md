LYRICS


(1)


jaya
 re jaya re jaya, ṭhākura narottama,

prema bhakati mahārāja

yākara mantrī, abhinna kalevara,

rāmacandra kavirāja






(2)


prema
 mukuṭa maṇi, bhūṣaṇa
bhāvāvali,

ańgahi ańga virāja

nṛpa āsana, kheturī māha baiṭhato,

sańgahi bhakata samāja


 


(3)


sanātana
 rūpa kṛta, grantha bhāgavata,

anudina koroto vicāra

rādhā mādhava, yugala ujjvala rasa,

paramānanda sukha sāra






(4)


śrī
 sańkīrtana, viṣaya rase unamata,

dharmādharma nāhi jāno

yoga dāna vrata, ādi bhaye bhāgato,

royato karama geyāna


 


(5)


bhāgavata
 śāstra gaṇa, yo dei bhakati dhana,

tāko gaurava koru āpa

sāńkhya mīmāḿsaka, tarkādika joto,

kampita dekhi paratāpa






(6)


abhakata
 caura, dūrahi bhāgi rohu,

niyaṛe nāhi parakāśa

dīna hīna jane, deyalo bhakati dhane,

vaÃ±cita govinda dāsa


 


TRANSLATION


1-2) Â“All glories all
glories to Thakura Narottama, the great king of loving devotion, whose
counselor was Ramacandra Kaviraja, who was non different from him! His prema
was the crown jewel of all the ornamental symptoms of ecstasy he showed on his
body. He sat on the throne of the kingdom of Kheturi in the company of his
assembled devotees.Â”


 


3-4) Â“Every day he
discussed the theistic scriptures compiled by Sri Sanatana and Rupa Gosvami,
which contain the splendid amorous flavours of Sri Radha and Mddhava and that
are the essence of topmost ecstasy. In the ecstasy of sri sankirtana he did not
know what was pious and what was impious. Yoga, charity, vows and other kinds
of piety fled far away, while fruitive activities and non-dualistic knowledge
were weeping.Â”



5-6) Â“He upheld the honour of those theistic scriptures that bestow the
treasure of devotion and when they saw his might, sankhya, mimamsaka, tarka and
other speculative philosophies trembled. The thief-like non devotees fled far
away, unable to shine their light in his vicinity. He gave the treasure of
devotion to lowly and fallen fellows, and Govinda dasa covets the same.Â”
