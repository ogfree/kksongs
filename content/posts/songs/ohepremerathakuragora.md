TRANSLATION


1)
O Sri 
Gaurasundara
, 
worshipable

Lord of 
prema
! O my master! What will I tell You of
my sorrows and sufferings? I have forgotten my original identity.


 


2)
O my Lord, what more can I say? After enduring many wounds inflicted from my
difficulties, then many days later I remembered the reason for which You gave
me birth in this world.


 


3)
O Lord! IÂ’m so unfortunate that I had no attachment for worshiping You but was
always evil-minded and mad for material enjoyment. Living with sense enjoyers,
I became like them.


 


4)
Who am I? Why am I in this world? These questions I never pondered. Sometimes
enjoying, sometimes renouncing Â– my mind was dancing in this cheating.


 


5)
I never considered what would be my outcome. I never associated with 
KrsnaÂ’s
 devotees, and I exhibited all bad signs of being
opposed to 
Bhagavan
.


 


6)
Now, by Sri GuruÂ’s grace my eyes have been opened and my dream has been broken.
I now understand that I have only You and that Your beloved devotees are my
greatest friends in the prison house of this material world.


 


7)
Now I worship Your devotees exclusively and will serve no one else. O 
Natha
! Now I have taken shelter of Your lotus feet, which
are like red lotuses. Pulling me by the hair, please deliver me from MayaÂ’s
net.


 


8)
Do You not bestow Your mercy on the sinners? Were not 
Jagai

and 
Madhai
 also fallen? Yet You gave them Your mercy.
From this I can understand that You are the Lord of 
prema

and the deliverer of the fallen.


 


9)
O 
Prabhu
, I am devoid of 
bhakti
,
wretched, and destitute. Put Your feet that grant fearlessness on the head of
this offender. I take shelter of Your divine feet.
