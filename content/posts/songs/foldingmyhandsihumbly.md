LYRICS:


(1)


Folding
my hands I humbly humbly place


My bowing
head before the graceful two


Sacred
lotuslike feet of His Divine Grace


Srila
Prabhupadadeva who


 


(2)


Made
the sweet sweet nectar monsoon rains


Of
Krsna's mercy fall upon the breath


Of
thousands of souls who broke the grim cold chains


That
bound thousands of souls to this world of birth and death,


 


(3)


Who
placed the nectar of Krsna's holy name


On
thousands of tongues who placed in thousands of hearts 


The
glistening sacred pure and brilliant flame


Of
love for Krsna and who with the graceful arts


 


(4)


Of
poetry translated the holy books


From
which Lord Krsna at the reader looks.
