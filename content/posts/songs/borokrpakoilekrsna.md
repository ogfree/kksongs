TRANSLATION


1) My dear
Lord Krsna, You are so kind upon this useless soul, but I do not know why You
have brought me here. Now You can do whatever You like with me.


 


2) But
I guess You have some business here, otherwise why would You bring me to this terrible
place?


 


3)
Most of the population here is covered by the material modes of ignorance and
passion. Absorbed in material life, they think themselves very happy and
satisfied, and therefore they have no taste for the transcendental message of
Vasudeva. I do not know how they will be able to understand it.


 


4) But
I know Your causeless mercy can make everything possible because You are the
most expert mystic.



5) How will they understand the mellows of devotional service? O Lord, I am simply
praying for Your mercy so that I will be able to convince them about Your
message.


 


6) All
living entities have become under the control of the illusory energy by Your
will, and therefore, if You like, by Your will they can also be released from
the clutches of illusion.


 


7) I
wish that You may deliver them. Therefore if You so desire their deliverance,
then only will they be able to understand Your message.


 


8) The
words of Srimad-Bhagavatam are Your incarnation, and if a sober person
repeatedly receives it with submissive aural reception, then he will be able to
understand Your message. It is said in the Srimad-Bhagavatam (1.2.17-21):


 


"Sri
Krsna, the Personality of Godhead, who is the Paramatma [Supersoul] in
everyoneÂ’s heart and the benefactor of the truthful devotee, cleanses desire
for material enjoyment from the heart of the devotee who has developed the urge
to hear His messages, which are in themselves virtuous when properly heard and
chanted. By regular attendance in classes on the Bhagavatam and by rendering of
service to the pure devotee, all that is troublesome to the heart is almost
completely destroyed, and loving service unto the Personality of Godhead, who
is praised with transcendental songs, is established as an irrevocable fact. As
soon as irrevocable loving service is established in the heart, the effects of
natureÂ’s modes of passion and ignorance, such as lust, desire and hankering,
disappear from the heart. Then the devotee is established in goodness, and he
becomes completely happy. Thus established in the mode of unalloyed goodness,
the man whose mind has been enlivened by contact with devotional service to the
Lord gains positive scientific knowledge of the Personality of Godhead in the
stage of liberation from all material association. Thus the knot in the heart
is pierced, and all misgivings are cut to pieces. The chain of fruitive actions
is terminated when one sees the self as master."


 


9) He
will become liberated from the influence of the modes of ignorance and passion
and thus all inauspicious things accumulated in the core of the heart will
disappear.


 


10)
How will I make them understand this message of Krsna consciousness? I am very
unfortunate, unqualified and the most fallen. Therefore I am seeking Your
benediction so that I can convince them, for I am powerless to do so on my own.


 


11)
Somehow or other, O Lord, You have brought me here to speak about You. Now, my
Lord, it is up to You to make me a success or failure as You like.


 


12) O
spiritual master of all the worlds! I can simply repeat Your message, so if You
like You can make my power of speaking suitable for their understanding.


 


13)
Only by Your causeless mercy will my words become pure. I am sure that when
this transcendental message penetrates their hearts they will certainly feel
engladdened and thus become liberated from all unhappy conditions of life.


 


14) O
Lord, I am just like a puppet in Your hands. So if You have brought me here to
dance, then make me dance, make me dance, O Lord, make me dance as You like.


 


15)
I have no devotion, nor do I have any knowledge, but I have strong faith in the
holy name of Krsna. I have been designated as Bhaktivedanta, and now, if You
like, You can fulfill the real purport of Bhaktivedanta.
