WORD-FOR-WORD
TRANSLATION: 
Namaste
Narasimhaya


 


TRANSLATION


1)
I offer my obeisances to Lord Narasimha, who gives joy to Prahlada Maharaja and
whose nails are like chisels on the stone like chest of the demon
Hiranyakasipu.


 


2)
Lord Nrsimha is here and also there. Wherever I go Lord Nrsimha is there. He is
in the heart and is outside as well. I surrender to Lord Nrsimha, the origin of
all things and the supreme refuge.


 


3)
O Kesava! O Lord of the universe! O Lord Hari, who have assumed the form of
half-man, half-lionl All glories to You! Just as one can easily crush a wasp
between one's fingernails, so in the same way the body of the wasp like demon
Hiranyakasipu has been ripped apart by the wonderful pointed nails on Your
beautiful lotus hands.

In
His mouth the goddess Suddha-Sarasvati is always present, on His chest
