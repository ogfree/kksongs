TRANSLATION


1) O Lord 
krsna
, O Master of 
Srimati
 
Radharani
, 
Radha
 intently
worships 
You
 and cherishes You, considering You more
dear to her than her own life-breath. O Enjoyer of 
Srimati


Radharani
, You become conquered by the exalted pure
love of 
Radha
. I offer respectful 
obeisances

unto 
You
.


 


2) O Lord 
Krsna
, the 
gopis
 observed a
woman's footprints next to 
Yours
, and surmised that 
Srimati
 
Radharani
 have given up
everything to follow You. (When 
Your
 footprints
suddenly stopped), the 
gopis
 surmised that You had
disappeared to cause 
Radha
 to repent her own false
pride.


 


3) O Lord 
Krsna
, when the 
gopis
 found 
Srimati
 
Radharani
, she described
the amazing pastime that had happened. 
Radha
 and the
other 
gopis
 then continually searched for 
You
. O Lord, please protect me.
