TRANSLATION


1)
O 
Radha
' who, dressed in white flowers, decorated
with camphor, and a hand resting on a 
gopi
 messenger,
meets 
Subala's
 friend 
Krsna

on a sweet, moonlit spring night, please, for even a moment, delight my eyes.


 


2)
O 
Radha
 who out of contrariness refuses to enter the
cottage of amorous pastimes, begins walking on the path home, is stopped by Him
with a mixture of brute force and plaintive appeals, and responds with a smile
from deep within Your eyes, please, for even a moment, delight my eyes.


 


3)
O 
Radha
' who shines like a stationary lightning flash
on the handsome, broad chest of the dark monsoon cloud of Lord 
Madhava
, like a flowering vine on the jasmine-flower couch
of His chest, and like a charming garland of golden 
yuthi

flowers there, please, for even a moment, delight my eyes.


 


4)
O 
Radha
' who, without going anywhere else, stays on
the couch of amorous pastimes, talking for a long time with Lord 
Krsna
, and embracing Him so strongly that Your two forms
appear to become one, please, for even a moment, delight my eyes.


 


5)
O 
Radha
' who, fatigued by the passionate amorous
battle, sleeps on the great, blissful bed of Your beloved 
Krsna's

broad chest, O life and soul of 
Visakha
, who is made
happy by the nectar of Your pastimes, please, for even a moment, delight my
eyes.


 


6)
O 
Radha
' who, when Your amorous pastimes were
completed, was carefully decorated by Lord 
Mukunda
,
who to do this was instructed by Your 
gopi
 friend
maddened with pride and full of love because of Your great good fortune,
please, for even a moment, delight my eyes.


 


7)
O 
Radha
' who, glorified by Your friends in the
assembly of laughing 
gopis
, defeated the prince of 
Vraja
 with a host of crooked joking words in the forest
courtyard dear to 
Kamadeva
, please, for even a
moment, delight my eyes.


 


8)
O 
Radha
, angry with 
Krsna

over a small, accidental offense, refusing to speak with Him, and begged for
mercy with many flattering words, please, for even a moment, delight my eyes.


 


9)
O 
Radha
 who is waves of auspiciousness for Your
father, King 
Vrsabhanu
, O queen who is the constant
companion of Lord 
Krsna
 and a bumblebee in the forest
of pure love for Him, O moonlight shining on the lotus flowers of Your friends,
O ocean of mercy, please, for even a moment, delight my eyes.


 


10)
O 
Radha
, O limitless ocean of transcendental virtues,
O first friend of Lord 
Krsna
, O crown of 
Your
 dear friends filled with matchless virtues, O girl
melting with mercy for the people drowning in the ocean of suffering, please,
for even a moment, delight my eyes.


 


11)
One who, reciting these beautiful verses as an expert dramatic narrator, makes
the dancer of his tongue dance on the stage of these ten sweet verses named 
Prema-pura
 (A Flood of Pure Love), at once attains the
mercy of two transcendental gems.
