TRANSLATION


1) The
Blessed Lord said: There is a banyan tree which has its roots upward and its
branches down and whose leaves are the Vedic hymns. One who knows this tree is
the knower of the Vedas. 


 


2) The
branches of this tree extend downward and upward, nourished by the three modes
of material nature. The twigs are the objects of the senses. This tree also has
roots going down, and these are bound to the fruitive actions of human society.



 


3-4)
The real form of this tree cannot be perceived in this world. No one can
understand where it ends, where it begins, or where its foundation is. But with
determination one must cut down this tree with the weapon of detachment. So
doing, one must seek that place from which, having once gone, one never
returns, and there surrender to that Supreme Personality of Godhead from whom
everything has began and in whom everything is abiding since time immemorial. 


 


5) One
who is free from illusion, false prestige, and false association, who
understands the eternal, who is done with material lust and is freed from the
duality of happiness and distress, and who knows how to surrender unto the
Supreme Person, attains to that eternal kingdom. 


 


6)
That abode of Mine is not illumined by the sun or moon, nor by electricity. One
who reaches it never returns to this material world. 


 


7) The
living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental parts. Due
to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which
include the mind. 


 


8) The
living entity in the material world carries his different conceptions of life
from one body to another as the air carries aromas. 


 


9) The
living entity, thus taking another gross body, obtains a certain type of ear,
tongue, and nose and sense of touch, which are grouped about the mind. He thus
enjoys a particular set of sense objects. 


 


10)
The foolish cannot understand how a living entity can quit his body, nor can
they understand what sort of body he enjoys under the spell of the modes of
nature. But one whose eyes are trained in knowledge can see all this. 


 


11)
The endeavoring transcendentalist, who is situated in self-realization, can see
all this clearly. But those who are not situated in self-realization cannot see
what is taking place, though they may try to. 


 


12)
The splendor of the sun, which dissipates the darkness of this whole world,
comes from Me. And the splendor of the moon and the splendor of fire are also
from Me. 


 


13) I
enter into each planet, and by My energy they stay in orbit. I become the moon
and thereby supply the juice of life to all vegetables. 


 


14) I
am the fire of digestion in every living body, and I am the air of life,
outgoing and incoming, by which I digest the four kinds of foodstuff. 


 


15) I
am seated in everyone's heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness.
By all the Vedas I am to be known; indeed I am the compiler of Vedanta, and I
am the knower of the Vedas. 


 


16)
There are two classes of beings, the fallible and the infallible. In the
material world every entity is fallible, and in the spiritual world every
entity is called infallible. 


 


17)
Besides these two, there is the greatest living personality, the Lord Himself,
who has entered into these worlds and is maintaining them. 


 


18)
Because I am transcendental, beyond both the fallible and the infallible, and
because I am the greatest, I am celebrated both in the world and in the Vedas
as that Supreme Person. 


 


19)
Whoever knows Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, without doubting, is to
be understood as the knower of everything, and He therefore engages himself in
full devotional service, O son of Bharata. 


 


20)
This is the most confidential part of the Vedic scriptures, O sinless one, and
it is disclosed now by Me. Whoever understands this will become wise, and his
endeavors will know perfection.
