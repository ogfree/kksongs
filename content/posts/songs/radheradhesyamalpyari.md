TRANSLATION


(Refrain):
Radhe Radhe! Lover of Lord Syama! Please deliver me, Oh boat of life! This
fallen beggar has come to Your door. Please give me a new life. Please deliver
me, Oh boat of life!


 


1) You
are the lover of Your love. Lord Krsna is madly loving You. Without Krsna, You
are like a silent flute unable to produce a tone or melody. Now, Your mercy
will shower upon me; please deliver me, O boat of life!


 


2)
Radhe Radhe! Please show me the path to attain a pure life. I will break all
false bonds and offer myself completely to Your lotus feet. After saying this,
why have you become silent? Please deliver me, O boat of life!


 


3)
Lord Syama is the ocean of love for Radha who is the nectarean shore. From this
shore, there is drop that flashes and shines. I surrender unto Your lotus feet
and please change me; please deliver me, O boat of life!


 


4) You
are devotional service. You are spiritual power. You are Jagamaya. Those who
meditate upon You and worship You will cut false material relations. Oh Beloved
of Syama, we are worshippers of love. Please deliver me, O boat of life!
