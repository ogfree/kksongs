TRANSLATION


1) If
your mind is always absorbed in chanting the glories of Lord Krsna with great
care, then by that process of Sri-krsna-kirtana you will attain transcendental
qualification.


 


2) You
should give up all false pride and always consider yourself to be worthless,
destitute, lower and more humble than a blade of grass.


 


3) You
should practice forgiveness like that of a tree, and giving up violence toward
other living beings, you should protect and maintain them.


 


4) In
the course of passing your life, you should never give anxiety to others, but
rather do good to them while forgetting about your own happiness.


 


5)
When one has thus become a great soul, possessing all good qualities, one
should abandon all desires for fame and honor and make one's heart humble.


 


6)
Knowing that Lord Krsna resides within all living creatures, one should with
great respect consistently show honor to all beings.


 


7) By
possessing these four qualities-humility, mercifulness, respect toward others,
and the renunciation of desires for prestige-one becomes virtuous. In such a
state you may sing the glories of the Supreme Lord.


 


8)
Weeping, Bhaktivinoda submits his prayer at the lotus feet of the the
Lord: "O Lord, when will you give me the qualification for possessing
attributes such as these?"
