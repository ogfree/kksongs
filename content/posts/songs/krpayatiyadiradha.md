TRANSLATION


1) If 
Srimati


Radhika
 is merciful to me, then all obstacles to my
devotion will be removed. There will be nothing more for me to attain because I
will have received the fruits offered by the paths of both 
vaidhi-marga

and raga-
marga
. And if 
She

will speak to me while smiling gently, I will see Her brilliant rows of teeth
which are like lines of priceless jewels. Having seen them one time, the goal
of gaining liberation from material existence will be rendered insignificant.


 


2) O 
Syamasundara
!
O You whose head is adorned with peacock feathers! Your face is always graced
with a playful smile, 
Your
 flute-playing is
enchanting, and You are expert in relishing 
rasa
 with

Srimati
 
Radhika
. Because 
You
 are an ocean of mercy, I am appealing to You to please
make me a 
kinkari
 (maidservant) at the feet of Your
beloved.


 


3) You are the Lord of the
life of the daughter of 
Vrsabhanu
 Maharaja and are
like a bee 
who
 is always eager to taste the nectar of
Her lips. O 
Rasika-sekhara
, foremost of those who are

rasika
! I donÂ’t desire anything other than to always
reside at the feet of 
Srimati
 
Radhika
.


 


4) O 
Nanda-nandana
!
O all-pervading 
Prabhu
! O You who enchant my mind,
and indeed, the minds of all! Taking a piece of straw in my teeth, my humble
entreaty to 
You
 is that She, who is the love of Your
life, will remain my dear 
worshipable
 goddess birth
after birth.
