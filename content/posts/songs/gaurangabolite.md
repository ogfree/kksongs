WORD
FOR WORD TRANSLATION: 
Gauranga Bolite
Habe Pulaka Sarira


 


TRANSLATION


1)
When will that opportune moment come to us, when there will be shivering of the
body as soon as we chant Lord Gauranga's name?  While chanting Hare Krsna,
when will there be tears in the eyes? 


 


2)
When will I obtain the mercy of Lord Nityananda-candra?  When, by His
mercy will the desire for material enjoyment become very insignificant? 


 


3)
When the mind is completely purified, being freed from material anxieties and
desires, then I shall be able to understand Vrndavana and the conjugal love of
Radha and Krsna, and then my spiritual life will be successful. 


 


4)
When shall I be very much eager to study the books left by the Six Gosvami's,
headed by Srila Rupa Gosvami and Srila Raghunatha dasa Gosvami?  By their
instruction I shall be able to properly understand the loving affairs of Radha
and Krsna. 


 


5)
My only aspiration is to attain the lotus feet of the Six Gosvamis headed by
Srila Rupa Gosvami and Srila Raghunatha dasa Gosvami.  Narottama dasa
constantly prays to attain their lotus feet.
