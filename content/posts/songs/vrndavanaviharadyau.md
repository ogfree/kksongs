TRANSLATION


1)
Unto the Pair engaged in sportive dalliance in 
Vrndavana

the Pair whose forms abound with eternity, knowledge & bliss the Pair who are
seated in the center of a jeweled pavilion, I bow to 
Radha

and 
Krsna


 


2)
Unto the Pair who wear yellow and blue garments the Pair who are sublimely
peaceful the Pair who bodies emit dark and fair auras the Pair who are
perpetually enjoying the Rasa-Dance the Pair who are embodiments of divine
truth, I bow to 
Radha
 and 
Krsna


 


3)
Unto the Pair who are overwhelmed with ecstatic emotions the Pair who are
always very captivating the Pair who are accomplished in devising Rasa-Dance
variations the Pair who know the 
divne
 potency of 
Their
 flute-playing, I bow to 
Radha

and 
Krsna


 


4)
Unto the Pair who live in the gardens by the 
Yamuna

river, the Pair who sport in a blossoming 
kadamba
-tree
cottage, the Pair who are the Lords of the desire-tree forest I bow to 
Radha
 and 
Krsna


 


5)
Unto the Pair who 
are
 fond of bathing in the 
Yamuna
, the Pair who are fond of playing games on 
Govardhana
 Hill the Pair who are fond of wearing garlands
of divine 
mandara
 flowers, I bow to 
Radha
 and 
Krsna


 


6)
Unto the Pair who feet are adorned with tinkling anklets unto the Pair whose
magnificent pearls dangle from the tips of their noses the Pair whose lovely
faces beam with sweet gentle smiles, I bow to 
Radha

and 
Krsna


 


7)
Unto the Pair who causes the creation, maintenance, & annihilation of
limitless millions of material universes, the Pair who are the enchanters of
all planets and peoples, I bow to 
Radha
 and 
Krsna


 


8)
Unto the Pair who 
are
 overcome with the 
rasa
 of each other, the Pair who are dear to each others'
devotees the Pair who are 
uttlerly
 consumed in the
ocean of 
rasa
, I bow to 
Radha

and 
Krsna
