TRANSLATION


Refrain: Friend, 
Radha
, who is expert in water-pastimes, is now playing in 
Her
 own lake with Lord 
Krsna
.
Â  


 


1) He struggles to steal 
Her
 garments. She strikes Him with a lotus flower.


 


2) By force He tightly
embraces and kisses 
Her
. She mercilessly splashes Him
with cold water.


 


3) Overwhelmed with bliss,
His eternal strength is lessened. She laughs at the pretended conquest of 
Her
 beloved.


 


REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:


This song is sung in Raga 
Dhanasri
.
