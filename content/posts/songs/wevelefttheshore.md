LYRICS:


(1)


WeÂ’ve
left the shore, WeÂ’re sailing forth, to our promised land


Across
the seas, of many miseries, WeÂ’ll not return again


Lord,
you sent him here to open up our eyes


Now,
your pure devotee gives his high advice


 


(2)


WeÂ’ve
faded away having gone astray, from our forest lands


Being
orphan souls of many changing roles, from strange and foreign lands


Oh! We
have traveled all alone


Now,
are Gurudeva has come to take us home


 


(Refrain)


Prabhupada,
you are the captain of the boat


Giving
us direction how stay afloat


Prabhupada,
you are the master of the ship


Guiding
us and making sure we never slip


 


(3)


The
loads of ways on how his binding gaze, he takes the eyes


The
gentle breeze of truth and harmony, gives us inner light


So,
the time has come to listen and to learn


How,
to sail into the world that lies within 


 


(4)


We
have the guide, standing high insight, showing us the way


The
friend indeed, with no selfish greed, can cause a tidal wave


So,
you sailed the ship beyond the stars


To,
the lotus petal planet of Lord Krsna.


 


(Refrain)


Prabhupada,
you are the captain of the boat


Giving
us direction how stay afloat


Prabhupada,
you are the master of the ship


Guiding
us and making sure we never slip


Prabhupada,
you are the master of the mind


Calling
to innovated mass of fallen mankind


Prabhupada,
you are the savior of the soul


Giving
understanding on how to reach the highest goal
