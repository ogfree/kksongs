LYRICS:


(1)


Look
It is a peaceful springtime day.


Like
silent sages all the cows now sit


In
shade The Yamuna's dark waves are lit


By
sunshine Now the leaping black deer play


 


(2)


In
forest groves Lord Krsna finds His way


Among
the flowering trees Now infinite


Graces
adorn His limbs Now sweet smiles flit


Across
His eyes He walks Where will He stay?


 


(3)


Playful
charming Krsna stops Now where 


Will
He sit? He finds a flowering tree's root


His
anklets jingle A peacock feather crown


Adorns
His graceful curly jet black hair.


A
garland of flowers adorns His chest Sitting down


He
sings graceful languid melodies on His flute.
