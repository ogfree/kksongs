TRANSLATION


1) O my dear Hero! O Lord,
the flute player! Please hear my request to 
You
. Your
jewel-like toenails resemble the rows of moons that I wear like a necklace
around my neck. 


 


2) When 
You

go to the forest with 
Sridama
 and 
Sudama
,
at that time I stand at the doorstep thinking of going with You. But I am
afraid of the elders and the respectable people. Therefore, my eyes simply gaze
after 
You
.


 


3) Whenever I see the new
clouds, O my friend, I immediately remember 
You
 and I
let loose my hair. When I cook in the kitchen, I simply sing 
Your

glories and cry on the pretext of smoke. 


 


4) O beloved Lord! You are
neither a jewel nor a diamond that I can keep 
You
 tied
to the end of my cloth. You are not a flower that I can decorate my hair with.
If I were not a woman, I could have taken 
You
, the
ocean of divine qualities, all over the country.


 


5) If I were a guru or
sandalwood, then I would be smeared on 
Your
 limbs, and
when You would perspire, I would have fallen at Your reddish lotus feet. What
desires I have! Although I am a dwarf, still I want to touch the moon. Will the
creator ever fulfill my desire? 


 


6) 
Narottama


dasa
 says, Â“Please hear, O most merciful Lord! Please
do not neglect me. The day I give up my body being fully absorbed in 
Your
 thoughts, please give me shelter at Your lotus feet.
