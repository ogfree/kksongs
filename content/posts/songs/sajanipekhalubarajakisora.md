TRANSLATION


(Refrain)
O 
gopi
 friend, today I saw a handsome teenage boy in 
Vraja
. The 
cakora
 birds of my
eyes became wild to taste the sweetness of the moonlight of the moon of His
face.


 


1)
He was crowned with the feather of a wild peacock. The fragrance of His jasmine
garland made the buzzing black bees wild with bliss. 


 


2)
His form was a dark monsoon cloud. His eyebrows were the archer 
Kamadeva's
 two bows. From His lotus eyes 
Kamadeva
 fired his five arrows. The saintly 
gopis
' hearts were gravely wounded. Their lives are now in
doubt.


 


3)
His glistening jewel earrings shaped like 
Kamadeva's

sharks swing to and fro from His ears. The fish of the 
gopis
'
hearts gaze at that shark. Now that shark devours those small fish. 
Govinda
 
dasa
 thinks in this way.

song is sung in Raga
