TRANSLATION


1)
I bow down to the formidable Lord Visnu whose large, round eyes are wildly open
and is ready to destroy the opposite party. Simply by His roaring He makes the
whole world afraid.


 


2)
The son of Diti, Hiranyakasipu was considered by everyone as an imperishable
being. However the Lord shattered the body of the demon into pieces along with
his huge army. I bow down to such a heroic Lord.


 


3)
I bow down to the great Lord Visnu whose feet have seized underworld planets
(patala) the last of the seven worlds under the earth. His head entered the
heavenly planets and His arms entered the eight directions.


 


4)
I bow down to the Lord whose sparkling splendor is the source of the bright
light of the sun, of all the planets, the moon, the stars and that of the fire.


 


5)
I bow down to the primeval Lord who is unlimited and thereby also the knower of
everything. He is present everywhere at all times and He possesses no material
senses. 


 


6)
I bow down to the great Lord Nrsimha whose form resembles that of a man and
that of a lion. He has a big mane and large fangs.


 


7)
I bow down to the terrific Lord, by the remembrance of whose name all the
bhutas (ghosts), vetalas (ghastly creatures), rakshasas (demons) and all kinds
of diseases become fearful and are immediately destroyed.


 


8)
I bow down to the all auspicious Lord who is served by the auspicious goddess
of fortune and by taking shelter of whom everyone achieves all auspiciousness.


 


9)
I bow down to the Lord who is the death of death personified. He is the
destroyer of death and the hordes of enemies by appearing at the right time
when His devotees are attacked.


 


10)
I bow down to the Lord unto Whom by surrendering and paying obeisances one
becomes free from all distresses and enjoys every desire he may have.


 


11)
O Lord, You are the Supreme Soul. I bow down to You and consider myself Your
servant seeing everyone else has voluntarily become Your servant.


 


12)
Thus, Sankara has explained the real meaning of every word. One who recites
This prayer three times daily will increase his knowledge, duration of life and
beauty.


 


REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:


The
author of the song is disputed. It may be from a Shri Vaisnava acarya, Sankara
Paramesvarena, Lord Siva, or Ramanujacarya.


 


This
prayer glorifies the Nrsimha Kavaca Bica prayer, 
Om Hrim Pram Ksraum
.
Verses 1 through 10 contain a word of the Nrsimha Kavaca Bica prayer, such that
when read together, it forms the mantra.
