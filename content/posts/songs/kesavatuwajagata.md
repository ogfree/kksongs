TRANSLATION


1)
This material creation of Yours, O Kesava, is most strange. I have roamed
throughout the forest of this universe in consequence of my selfish acts, and I
have beheld many strange and curious sights.


 


2)
Forgetfulness of Your lotus feet has brought on anguish and grief. As I burn in
this fire of misery, my would-be saviors Â— Kapila, Gautama, Kanada, Jaimini,
and Buddha Â— come running to my aid.


 


3)
Each expounds his particular view, dangling various pleasures and liberation as
bait in their philosophical traps. They are all cheaters, averse to Your
devotional service and thus fatally dangerous.


 


4)
They are magnates of karma, jnana, and yoga who specialize in opinions and
proofs for cheating the materially inclined. Bhaktivinoda, considering refuge
at the feet of the Vaisnavas as essential, pays his respects to these cheating
philosophers from afar.


 


REMARKS/EXTRA
INFORMATION:


While
Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura mentioned Lord Buddha in this song, Lord Buddha is
an incarnation of Krsna, as described by the Srimad Bhagavatam. However, the philosophy
of voidism by Lord Buddha was presented to steer the brahmanas away from the
Vedas, as unauthorized animal sacrifices were being performed under the name of
the Vedas. For this circumstantial purpose, Vaisnava worship Lord Buddha, but
do not follow the teachings as presented by that incarnation.
