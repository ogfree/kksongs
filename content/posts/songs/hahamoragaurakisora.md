TRANSLATION


1) Oh, my most youthful
Lord 
Gaura-Kisora
! When will 
You

be merciful and show Yourself to me, thus stealing my mind within the forest of

Godruma
?


 


2) Within the grove of 
Ananda-sukhada-kunja
, You stand with Sri 
Gadadhara
 on Your left side, radiating the effulgence of
pure gold. With beautiful curling hair, You are wearing the fine dress of a
dramatic actor.


 


3) In an instant Sri 
Sri
 
Radha-Madhava
 will appear and
brilliantly illuminate the entire scene. Accompanied by all of Their
confidential friends and associates, They will dance with Their necks decorated
with various types of golden necklaces.


 


4) The merciful 
Ananga-Manjari
, catching the hands of this maidservant,
will take me to offer me in devotion unto Sri 
Sri
 
Radha-Madhava
, and my eyes will be brimming with pleasure
to behold the beauty and sweetness of Them both.


 


Remarks/ Extra Information
: 


This prayer is submitted by

Bhaktivinoda
 
Thakura
 unto
Sri 
Sri
 
Gaura-Gadadhara
,
his personal deities at his house in 
Godruma
.
