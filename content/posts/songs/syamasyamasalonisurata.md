TRANSLATION


(Refrain)
The beautiful faces of 
Syama
 and 
Syama

are decorated in 
basanti
.


 


1)
The peacock feather which adorns 
KrsnaÂ’s
 crown is 
basanti
.
 The shining moonlight is 
basanti
. 
The flute decorating His face is 
basanti
. 
And His beautiful earrings are also 
basanti
.


 


2) 
The 
candana
 
on His forehead is 
basanti
. 
His yellow shawl is 
basanti
.


His
residence in my mind and heart is 
basanti
. 
And the beautiful garland of forest
flowers around His neck is also 
basanti
.


 


3) 
His golden bracelets are 
basanti
. 
His carefree gait is 
basanti
,
His attire is 
basanti
, a
nd His jingling 
anklebells

which swing to and fro are also 
basanti
.


 


4)
The joyous sounds made by the cowherd boys are 
basanti
. 
The melody of the drums and other
instruments is 
basanti
. 
EveryoneÂ’s speaking is 
basanti
. 
And as the leader of the 
sakhis
, 
Radheji
 is also 
basanti
.


 


5) 
The 
prasada
 
which He has lovingly given us is 
basanti
, a
nd its taste is also 
basanti
. 
The entire environment is 
basanti
. 
Ghasirama

says that the names of 
Syama
 and 
Syama

are also 
basanti
.
