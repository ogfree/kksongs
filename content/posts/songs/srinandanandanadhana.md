TRANSLATION


1-2)

The
 delightful Son of 
Nanda

Maharaja considers all His loving consorts, the 
gopis
,
to be His most valued treasure. Both He and they are the foundations of the
mellow of conjugal love. This mellow flows back and forth between them all in
these two ways: 1) when the 
rati
 (affection) flows
toward the 
gopis
 and takes shelter in their hearts as
the object, then Krsna becomes the one and only subject of their love, and 2)
when the 
rati
 flows toward Krsna and takes shelter in
His heart as the object, then the 
gopis
 become the
one and only subject of His love. In this manner affection flows mutually
within the 
sthayi
 
bhava

(the permanent ecstasy) because of the combination of both the subject and
object, without which there is no possibility of genuine love existing.


 


3)
Thus there is the necessary functioning of this combination of foundation which
contain this love for Krsna, and these mellows are the eternal and topmost goal
of all existences. Thus within 
Vraja
, 
Krsna
 is known as 
Gopinatha
, the
Lord of the 
gopis
. And the most highly valued
treasure of this 
Madana-Mohana
 is all the cowherd
maidens of 
Vraja
, the 
gopis
.
Krsna is their 
dearmost
 lover, their sweet 
relisher
, and the Lord and Master of 
Srimati


Radharani
. 


 


4)
Lord 
Madhava
 thoroughly enjoys Himself in full eternal
bliss as He tastes the internal mellows contained within the principles known
as 
sviya
 (love within marriage) and 
parakiya
 (unwedded love). And one who also becomes one of
these basic foundations for sharing these loving exchanges is most fortunate, for
she also tastes the maddening wine of these supremely transcendental mellows
along with Krsna Himself.
