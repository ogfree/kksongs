TRANSLATION


1)
The learned man, endeavoring in the practice of jnana-yoga, eventually sees the
Supreme Brahman. That realization of Brahman, in full knowledge, removes all
the potential sinful reactions lying in his heart.


 


2)
By dint of Brahman realization all such potential sinful reactions are
destroyed; but unless one undergoes the suffering of current sinful reactions,
they will not be destroyed. Therefore, despite being a Brahman realized soul,
even such a learned man must undergo the current reactions to his sins and thus
be implicated in the cycle of birth and death.


 


3)
But, O holy name, if You are vibrated on the tongue of Your unalloyed devotee,
then all of his sinful reactions of both past and present lives are completely
destroyed. This truth is sung by the Vedas again and again.


 


4)
O sun of the holy name, when You arise on the horizon of the living beingÂ’s
heart, it becomes completely purified, the bondage to materialistic activities
and speculative knowledge disappears and the soulÂ’s worldly existence comes to
an end without any difficulty.


 


5)
Thakura Bhaktivinoda, raising his arms says, Â“Take up the banners of the holy
name and walk along sounding the drum of the holy name. In this way you will
surely obtain the direct audience of Krsna, the holder of the flute.Â”
