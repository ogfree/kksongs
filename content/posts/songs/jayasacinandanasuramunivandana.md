TRANSLATION


(1-2)


All glories to Sri 
Krsna
 
Caitanya
 
Mahaprabhu
, the son of 
Sacidevi
.
Great sages and demigods always sing His praise, for by doing 
so,
 the fear of repeated birth and death is cut to pieces.
All glories to the 
kirtana
 of the holy name of 
Krsna
, for when one chants the holy name of 
Krsna
 and dances in ecstasy, the filth of this iron age of
Kali disappears.


 


(3-4)


Sri 
Caitanya

delights all eyes with his charming beauty. He is the most dearly beloved Lord
of all and the intimate brother of 
Visvarupa
. He
brings the highest auspiciousness to everyone, for He floods the entire
universe with the nectar of love of godhead and thus saves all living beings.
All Glories to 
Laksmipriya
 and 
Visnupriya-devi
,
who are very dear to Sri 
Nimai
 
Pandita
.
All glories to 
Their
 dear family servant, 
Isana
.


 


(5-6)


All glories to 
Sita
 
Thakurani
 and Sri 
Advaita
 
Acarya
, all glories to 
Malini
 
devi

and 
Srivasa
 
Thakura
, and
all glories to 
Acarya
 
Candrasekhara
.

all
 glories to 
Srila
 
Nityananda
 
Prabhu
, 
Gadadhara
 
Pandita
 and 
Haridasa
 
Thakura
, the 
Namacarya
.


 


(7-8)


All glories to 
Murari
 
Gupta,
 and all glories to 
Mukunda
 
Dutta
. All glories to all
the other eternal associates of Sri 
Caitanya
 
Mahaprabhu
. By singing the glories of 
Srila


Prabhupada
(*) and all those great souls who are eternal
associates of Sri 
Caitanya
 
Mahaprabhu
,
even the lowest of men can obtain the highest treasure of divine love.

Prabhupada

Bhaktisiddhanta

Thakura
, as he was the Â“
Srila
 
Prabhupada
Â” of the author of this song.
