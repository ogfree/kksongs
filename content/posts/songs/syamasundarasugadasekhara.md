TRANSLATION


(Refrain)
He is handsome and dark. His peacock-feather crown is graceful. His smile
glistens like the autumn moon. Again and again He happily talks with His 
gopa
 friends, friends whose glorious garments, age, and
sweetness are all like His own.


 


1)
His graceful sweet form glistens like sapphires. His ways are charming. His
garland of 
mallika
 and 
malati

flowers makes the black bees wild with its nectar scent. He has set 
Kamadeva's
 trap.


 


2)
A line of graceful peacock feathers kisses His curly glistening hair. His
glistening restless wonderful glances rob every heart.


 


3)
He is decorated with red 
gairika
 and yellow 
gorocana
, anointed with sweet fragrances, and dressed in
graceful garments. 
Govinda
 
dasa

sings the glories of Him, the Lord filled with all virtues, the protector of
the cowherd people.
