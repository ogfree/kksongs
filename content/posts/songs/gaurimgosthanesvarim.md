TRANSLATION


1)
O heart, please worship fair-complexioned, profoundly sweet Sri Radha, who
worships Lord Krsna's path with the millions of flowers of Her every breath,
who is more dear to Lord Krsna than His own life, who is affectionately
embraced by Her dear friend Lalita, and who is showered with a host of playful
jokes by Visakha. 


 


2)
O heart, please worship profoundly sweet Sri Radha, who, by Her favorite lake,
in a forest splendid with the sounds of many bees greedy to taste the honey of
fragrant, blossoming flowers, discusses the charming politics of Kama's kingdom
with Kama's prime minister, Lord Hari.


 


3)
O heart, please worship profoundly sweet Sri Radha, whose senses, tossed by the
high waves of Lord Krsna's sidelong glance, dance in the arena of Kama, who
crookedly defeats her lover in the battle of amorous passion, and who is
intoxicated by drinking the sweet nectar of the benedictions presented by Her
smiling friends.


 


4)
O heart, please worship profoundly sweet Sri Radha, who when Lord Krsna
defeated Her in the dice-game and, smiling, blissful, and proud, the corners of
His eyes red and the hairs of His trembling body erect, began to sip the two
bimba fruit lips He won as the prize, She suddenly struck Him with a lotus
flower.


 


5)
O heart, please worship profoundly sweet Sri Radha, who, gazing with Visakha at
the springtime beauty of the forest, resting her left hand on Krsna's shoulder,
and maddened with deep friendship, with love and bliss suddenly placed a
flowering twig on her beloved's ear. 


 


6)
O heart, please worship profoundly sweet Sri Radha, who, in the midst of a cave
in Govardhana Hill, on a great bed made of flowers, as She pretended to sleep,
tried to steal Krsna's flute and garland, was stopped by Him as he smiled and
grasped Her neck, and when She became frightened and eager to run away, was
stopped again as He pressed Her breasts with both His hands.


 


7)
O heart, please worship profoundly sweet Sri Radha, who, when Krsna, placing
the cows in front, entered Vraja with His friends, and with dancing, passionate
eyes gazed at Her face, She, with many playful glances from the corners of Her
eyes, made Him tremble and Her rival Padma wilt with despair.


 


8)
O heart, please worship profoundly sweet Sri Radha, who is the star Anuradha
shining with the Govinda moon in the opulent sky of Vraja Forest, and who with
her great splendor dims the many millions of gopi stars eternally shining in
the glorious rasa dance.


 


9)
An intelligent and saintly person who, falling down on the ground, with choked
words again and again recites this Navastaka, with the nectar of direct service
lovingly waters the splendid nectar vine of Sri Radha, the playground of the
intoxicated black bee of Lord Mukunda.
