TRANSLATION


1)
My dear mind, you are so fondly attached to rolling to and fro upon the waves
of lust. Abandoning your sensual material lust, just render service in pure spiritual
lust and thus extend yourself into the realm of transcendentally uncommon
pastimes.


 


2)
It is not possible to quench the thirst of this temporary mundane lust, for its
nature is to continuously create a disturbing situation. Although you desire the
things associated with lust, still you can not always get them. And even if you
do get the things you lust after, you cannot keep them, for such temporary
things will give up your company very soon.


 


3)
My dear mind, you faithfully render service to this mundane lust, but I see
that it actually cannot give you anything substantial; rather, it simply burns
my entire body with miserable dissatisfaction. So then just give up all your
false material lust and just accept the true, spiritual lust by worshiping the
Cupid of 
Vrndavana
. Then, He will shoot your
spiritual body full of His flower arrow, and you will thereby become filled to
the brim with eternal ecstatic love for Him.
