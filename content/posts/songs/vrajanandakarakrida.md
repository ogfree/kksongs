TRANSLATION


1) O 
Krsna
,
Your childish attempt to speak was very charming and enchanting, and 
Your
 transcendental pastimes caused the residents of 
Vraja
 to become jubilant. You would wander here and there
in the company of 
Your
 friends, the young protectors
of the calves, although You would not go very far from Your home in 
Vraja
.


 


2) O 
Krsna
,
accompanied by Lord 
Balarama
 and other cowherd boy
friends, 
You
 delighted in performing various different
pastimes in the gardens of 
Vrndavana
. You are very
fond of playing 
Your
 flute, upon which You produce an
amazingly sweet sound.


 


3) O 
Krsna
,

Your
 charming and beautiful form bends in three places
and the flute to Your lips. You are delighted to shoot (pebbles) with a
sling-shot and 
You
 are very enthusiastic to play with
a ball.


 


4) O 
Krsna
,
You and Your friends would imitate the activities of the bull-calves and the
sounds of the grown-up bulls. You would enjoy mock-fighting with 
Your
 friends, and You would imitate the sounds of all the
forest animals. All glories unto 
You
.
