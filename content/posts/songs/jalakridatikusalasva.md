TRANSLATION


1) O Lord 
Krsna
, ornamented with a great multitude of garlands, 
You
 gracefully performed pastimes in the water with the
smiling 
gopis
, who laughed as they splashed You with
water. O Lord, I offer respectful 
obeisances
 unto 
You
.


 


2) O Lord 
Krsna
, You performed pastimes, swimming about in the waters
of the 
Yamuna
 
river
.
Emerging from the water, 
You
 walked along the shore,
very attached to performing conjugal pastimes in the groves there.


 


3) O Lord 
Krsna
, all glories unto 
You
. You
are greatly attached to 
Srimati
 
Radharani
,
and 
You
 engage in amorous pastimes with 
Candravali
 
gopi
. You continually
drink the nectar from the lotus flower which is the face of 
Padma-gopi
,
and 
You
 have become very playful, inspired by the
side-long glances of 
Lalita-gopi
.


 


4) O Lord 
Krsna
, You try to fulfill all the wished of 
Visakha-gopi
 and 
You
 appear very
splendid, shining with the amorous love of 
Syamala-gopi
.
You are subservient to the 
nectarean
 and auspicious
love which 
Bhadra-gopi
 bears for 
You
,
and You are the master of the great treasure which is the life of 
Dhanya-gopi
.


 


5) O Lord 
Krsna
, You continually perform pastimes with the wives of
those who have taken birth as cowherd men. You are the debauchee with the 
kunkuma
 powder from the 
gopi's

breasts.
