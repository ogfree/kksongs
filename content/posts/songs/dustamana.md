TRANSLATION


1) O
wicked mind! What kind of Vaisnava do you think you are? Your pretentious show
of chanting Lord Hari's holy name in a solitary place is only for the sake of
attaining the false prestige of a worldly reputation -- it is nothing but pure
hypocrisy.


 


2)
Such materialistic prestige is as disgusting as the stool of a hog. Do you not
know that it is only a mere illusion cast by the potency of Maya? What is the
value of contemplating day and night your plans for enjoying wealth and women?
All these things are only temporary.


 


3)
When you claim wealth as your own, it creates in you ever-increasing desires
for material enjoyment. Your riches should be used for serving Madhava, the
Lord of all wealth. Neither is it your proper place to indulge in lust for
women, whose only true proprietor is Lord Yadava.


 


4) The
demon Ravana (lust-incarnate) fought with Lord Ramachandra (love-incarnate) in
order to gain the tree of worldly reputation -- but that oasis turned out to be
but a mirage cast in the desert wasteland of the Lord's illusory material
potency. Please cultivate fixed determination to attain only the steady and
solid platform whereupon a Vaisnava ever stands. If you neglect worshiping the
Lord from this position, then you will ultimately attain a hellish existence.


 


5) Why
do you needlessly suffer the torment of blaspheming the devotees of Lord Hari,
attempting to achieve their eminence, thereby only proving your own fruitless
foolishness? The desire for spiritual eminence is easily fulfilled when one
becomes a devotee of the Lord, for eternal fame automatically follows the heels
of a Vaisnava. And that fame is never to be considered a temporary worldly
opulence.


 


6) The
relationship between a devotee and Lord Hari is devoid of even a trace of
worldly illusion; it has nothing to do with the materialistic cheating
propensity. The prestige of so-called popularity in the material realm is
compared to a treacherous dog-eating witch, and the attempt to live in solitude
to supposedly engage in unalloyed bhajan is compared to an entangling network
of distraction. Please know that anyone striving in either of these ways verily
lives in the hell of Maya's illusion.


 


7)
"I shall give up chanting the Lord's name publicly in kirtan and retire to
solitude, thus smearing myself with worldly honor." Dear mind, what is the
good of seeking such so-called glory? I will always remind you that the great
soul Madhavendra Puri never deceived himself in that regard by committing theft
in his own storehouse of perception the way you do.


 


8)
Your cheap reputation is equal to the stool of a hog. An ordinary ambitious man
like you can never be equated with a devotee of Madhavendra Puri's eminence.
Under the sway of envy, you have drowned yourself in the filthy waters of
material enjoyment after having abandoned the excellent perfection of
congregational kirtan.


 


9)
Truly, O wicked mind, the glories of so-called solitary worship are propagated
only by false yogis using unscrupulous means to deceive others. To save
yourself from these pitfalls, please contemplate the instructions that the
Supreme Lord Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu kindly gave us while addressing Srila
Sanatana Goswami with the utmost care.


 


10) Do
not forget for a moment the two most valuable concepts that He taught: 1) the
principle of dry, apparent renunciation as opposed to real, appropriate
renunciation; and 2) the principle of a soul being trapped in the bondage of
matter as opposed to a soul who is liberated. Don't ever make the mistake of thinking
that these conflicting concepts are on the same level. Please remember this
while engaging yourself in chanting the Lord's holy names as loud as you
possibly can.


 


11)
One is truly a Vaisnava who has given up the habit of falling victim to the
ferocious tigress of wealth, beauty, and fame. Such a soul is factually
detached from material life, and is known as a pure devotee. Someone with this
consciousness of detachment has thereby become victorious over the mundane
world of birth and death.


 


12)
One is indeed detached who moderately partakes of worldly things that are
deemed necessary for living in devotional service; a devotee acting in that
manner does not fall prey to the disease of material infatuation. Thus devoid
of selfish attachment, and endowed with the ability to see things in relation
to the Lord, all sense objects are then directly perceived as being Lord
Madhava Himself.


 


13)
This is the standard of befitting renunciation, and one who realizes this is
most fortunate indeed. Everything involved in such a devotee's life represents
Lord Hari's personal spiritual opulence as manifest in the world of matter. On
the other hand, one who engages in chanting the Lord's name with hopes of
enhancing his own material reputation finds that all his activities and
paraphernalia represent only the riches of hypocrisy.


 


14) O
mind, please reject the company of two types of persons -- those desiring
impersonal liberation from the material world, and those who desire to enjoy
the pleasure of material sense objects. Both of these are equally non-devotees.
The things that are used in relation to Lord Krsna are objects belonging
directly to the transcendental realm, and thus having nothing to do with matter
they cannot be either owned or forsaken by persons interested in mundane
enjoyment or renunciation.


 


15) An
impersonal philospher is opposed to thinking of Krsna as an object of devotion,
and thus being puffed up with the false pride of imaginary liberation he dares
to criticize the true devotees of the Lord. O mind, you are the servant of the
Vaisnavas, and you should always hope for attaining devotion. Why then do you
make such a loud commotion by calling to me and trying to prove the supposed
supremacy of your practice of solitary worship?


 


16)
One who falsely gives up things that could actually be used in the Lord's
service proudly calls himself a `renunciate,' but unfortunately he can never
become a Vaisnava by such an attitude. Abandoning his servitorship to the lotus
feet of Lord Hari, and resigning himself to his solitary home -- whatever is
gained by that exercise can only be the worthless treasure of deception.


 


17)
Ever engage yourself in the service of Sri Radha, and keep aloof from the
vicious snake of materialistic sense gratification. The glory of participating
in the Lord's kirtan is not meant to bolster anyone's ambitions for personal
recognition. O mind, why then have you abandoned the identity of being Radha's
eternal servant in favor of retiring to a solitary place to practice the cheating
process of so-called bhajan?


 


18)
The most valuable treasures amongst the Lord's preachers are the eternal
personalities residing in Vraja-dham. They never occupy themselves with begging
for worthless material reputation, which is cherished only by the living dead.
The Vraja-vasis are truly infused with life, and therefore they preach in order
to give life to the walking corpses of the mundane world. All the songs that
the Vraja-vasis sing about the glories of Lord Krsna are devoid of any tinge of
desire for fame.


 


19)
Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati (servant of Radha and Her beloved Krsna) always
hopes for kirtan, and he begs all to loudly sing the names of Lord Hari. The
transcendental power of congregational chanting automatically awakens
remembrance of the Lord and His divine pastimes in relation to one's own
eternal spiritual form. Only at that time does it become possible to go off to
a solitary place and engage in the confidential worship of Their Lordships.
