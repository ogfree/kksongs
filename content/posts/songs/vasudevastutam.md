TRANSLATION


1)
O 
Krsna
, You revealed 
Your

transcendental form which is generally very difficult to see, 
Vasudeva
 offered reverential prayers glorifying You, the
cause of all causes who has simultaneously entered and not entered everything.
I offer respectful 
obeisances
 unto 
You
.


 


2)
O perfect 
Krsna
, You are simultaneously the doer and
the non-doer of everything, and by 
Your
 appearance You
made the entire universe peaceful and happy. You mercifully granted liberation
to the demons and 
You
 increased the pure love of Your
devotees. (I offer respectful 
obeisances
 unto You.).


 


3)
O 
Krsna
, O Creator of time, O annihilator of the
universe, O lamp of transcendental knowledge, O Lord free from any material
attributes or contact, O bliss of the eyes of 
Devaki
,
who fearfully offered prayers to 
You
, all glories unto
You.


 


4)
O 
Krsna
, Your splendor makes all the planets appear
like a joke, and 
You
 rescue from death those who take
shelter of Your lotus feet. Because material eyes are not appropriate
instruments to see 
Your
 transcendental form, You
covered that divine form which was formerly shown to Your mother.
