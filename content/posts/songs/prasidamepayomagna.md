TRANSLATION


1) O Lord Krsna, please be
merciful unto me. Very affectionate to Your father, Nanda Maharaja, You
searched for him when he disappeared while immersed in the water (of the
Yamuna). You traveled to the abode of Varuna, who was greatly pleased to see
You.


 


2) O Lord Krsna, Varunadeva
worshipped Your lotus feet, and You became greatly pleased with him. You
forgave his offenses and released Nanda Maharaja from his bonds.


 


3) O Lord Krsna, although
Nanda Maharaja heard Varunadeva glorify You, he did not consider Your great
opulence and power, but only thought of You as a little cowherd boy. The other
cowherd men were full of doubts about You, and understanding their hearts, You
became full of compassion for them.


 


4) O Lord Krsna, You
granted the goals of life to the cowherd men who were greatly delighted by attaining
a glimpse of Your own planet. Within the waters of Brahma-kunda, You revealed
the desired spiritual abode to the cowherd men.


 


REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:


This
song is based on Srimad Bhagavatam Canto 10 Chapter 28.
