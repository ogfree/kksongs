TRANSLATION


(Refrain)
Look! Look at Lord 
GauraÂ’s
 wonderful pastimes! The
great debauchee who loved millions of girls now has accepted 
sannyasa
.


 


1)
In the past He bore marks of red from the 
kunkuma
 on
the 
gopis
Â’ breasts. Now a saffron garment decorates
His limbs. In the past He was delighted by 
Srimati
 
RadharaniÂ’s
 sweet touch. Now His fair body rebukes the
splendor of gold.


 


2)
In the past He was tightly bound by the 
vraja-gopis
Â’
arms. Now He is always overcome with the ecstasy of a devoteeÂ’s spiritual love.
Now the hairs of His body stand erect in spiritual love. Now tears of spiritual
love stream from His eyes.


 


3)
He was the graceful dancer whose body was dark like a monsoon cloud, the dancer
who enjoyed pastimes in 
Vrndavana
 
Forest
. 
Balarama
 
dasa

says: That best of dancers has now become a penniless 
sannyasi
.
Now He goes from house to house begging everyone to give the alms that they
will fall in love with Lord 
Krsna
.


 


REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:


This
is to be sung in Raga 
Kedara
.
