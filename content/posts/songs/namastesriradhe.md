TRANSLATION


Refrain:
I offer my obeisances to you, Sri Radhe. I offer my obeisances to You, Sri
Syama.


 


1)
[Srimati Radharani said] Â“My dear friend, now I have met My very old and dear friend
Krsna on this field of Kuruksetra. I am the same Radharani, and now We are
meeting together. It is very pleasant, but still I would like to go to the bank
of the Yamuna beneath the trees of the forest there. I wish to hear the
vibration of His sweet flute playing the fifth note within that forest of
Vrndavana.Â”


 


2)
[Lord Krsna said] Â“The sweet, fragrant honey oozing from newly grown mango buds
is again and again attracting groups of bumblebees, and this forest is
trembling in the softly moving breezes from the Malaya Hills, which are full of
sandalwood trees. Thus the forest of Vrndavana is increasing My transcendental
pleasure.Â”


 


3)
[Lord Krsna said to Madhumangala] Â“My dear friend, this forest of Vrndavana is giving
great pleasure to our senses in various ways. Somewhere bumblebees are singing
in groups, and in some places mild breezes are cooling the entire atmosphere.
Somewhere the creepers and tree twigs are dancing, the mallika flowers are
expanding their fragrance, and an overabundance of juice is constantly flowing
in showers from pomegranate fruits.Â”


 


4)
[Paurnamasi said] Â“The beauty of Srimati RadharaniÂ’s eyes forcibly devours the
beauty of newly grown blue lotus flowers, and the beauty of Her face surpasses
that of an entire forest of fully blossomed lotuses. Her bodily luster seems to
place even gold into a painful situation. Thus the wonderful, unprecedented
beauty of Srimati Radharani is awakening in Vrndavana.Â”
