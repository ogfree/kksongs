TRANSLATION


1) O 
Krsna
,
decorated with autumn flowers, 
You
 appear very
charming as You perform pastimes in the autumn. You appear like an actor or a
dancer garlanded with 
karnikara
 flowers. I worship 
You
.


 


2) O 
Krsna
,
all glories unto 
You
. The corners of 
Your
 eyes dance in Your lotus-face, and You play very
melodiously on the excellent flute placed on Your lips, which are red as the 
bimba
 fruits.


 


3) O 
Krsna
,
I offer respectful 
obeisances
 unto 
You
.
You cast curved glances (from the corners of 
Your

eyes) and Your form charmingly bends in three places. The universe is enchanted
by the sound of 
Your
 flute, and the 
gopis
 sing about Your glories.


 


REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:


This
song is based on 
Srimad
 
Bhagavatam

Canto 10 Chapter 21.
