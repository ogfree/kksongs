LYRICS:


(1)


maner
mālā japbi jakhan, mana,


keno korbi
bāhya visarjana


mane mane
bhajan jakhan hoy,


prema uṭhle
paḍeÂ’ bāhya-dehe vyāpta hoÂ’ye roy;


ābār
dehe care, japāy kore, dharāy mālā anukṣaṇa


 


(2)


je
vyāṭā bhaṇḍa-tāpasa hoy,


baka-biḍāla
dekhāÂ’ye bāhya ninde atiśoy;


nije juta
peÂ’le kāminī-kanaka kore sadā saḿghaṭana


 


(3)


se
vyāṭār bhitora phakkākār,


bāhya-sādhana-nindā
boi ār āche kibā tāÂ’r


(nijer)
mana bhālo dekhā-te giye ninde sādhu-ācaraṇa


 


(4)


śuddha
koriÂ’ bhitora bāhira, bhāi,


hari-nām
korte thāko, tarke kāj nāi,


(śuṣka)
tomār tarka korte jīvana jāÂ’be


cāńda-bāul
tāy duḥkhī hoÂ’no


 


TRANSLATION


1) My
dear mind, when you chant japa on the mala within your mind, why do you cease
the actions of chanting japa externally? When one performs bhajan within the
mind, and prema factually arises internally, then the external body also
becomes pervaded by those symptoms. Therefore the body rocks and sways, while
one incessantly turns their beads in chanting japa. 


 


2) This
improper form of mental chanting is the tendency of the pretentious so-called
renunciants. As displayed in the fables of the crane and cat, such renunciation
is extremely contemptible. Although such a trait is shown externally, whenever
one gains an opportunity to enjoy women and wealth he continually indulges. 


 


3)
Inside such a man is merely an empty cavity of deceit. What does he have to
express other than direct blasphemy of the process of executing external
sadhana-bhakti? He thus makes a show of his own mental concoctions as being
supposedly "superior" while he openly condemns the activities of the
true sadhus. 


 


4) O
dear brother! Purify yourself both internally and externally. Stay engaged in
chanting Hari-nama, instead of simply babbling stubbornly with controversial
attitudes. When you pass your life consumed with dry arguments, then Cand Baul
becomes very sad.
