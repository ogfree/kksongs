TRANSLATION


(Refrain) Oh Dearest
Mother! I didnÂ’t eat butter!


 


1) In the morning, by your
order, I associated with the cows and grazed 
Madhubana

fields. At four hours later, I was playing the flute and roamed and it became
evening and I came home. When could I have eaten the butter?


 


2) I am so short, and the
butter is so high, that how it is possible for 
Me
 to
reach such stature? These young 
calf
 drink milk from
their mother cows, and they come and lick me on my lips. 


 


3) Â“Here is your stick and 
kambala
 again, and use it dance. Now that you accuse 
Me
 wrongly. I now realize a great secret, that you are not 
My
 mother. You are 
My
 foster
mother.Â” 
Sura
 
Dasa
, then,
sees Mother 
Yasoda
 clasping 
Krsna

on her breast and neck and said with teary eyes, Â“You didnÂ’t eat butter!Â”
