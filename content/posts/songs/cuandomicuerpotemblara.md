LYRICS:


(1)


Â¿CuÃ¡ndo
mi cuerpo temblarÃ¡


al
cantar Â´GaurangaÂ´?


Â¿CuÃ¡ndo
al cantar Â´Hari HariÂ´


caerÃ¡n
mis lÃ¡grimas?


 


(2)


Â¿CuÃ¡ndo
se apiadarÃ¡ de mÃ­ Nitaicand


Para
ver ya sin valor, el placer material?


 


(3)


Cuando
deje ese placer, mi mente se limpiarÃ¡


Y asÃ­
podrÃ© conocer, Sri Vrindavan


 


(4)


Â¿CuÃ¡ndo
desearÃ© aprender,


de
Rupa y Raghunath?


SÃ³lo
ahÃ­ podrÃ© entender, el rasa conyugal


 


(5)


Los
pies de Rupa Raghunath,


son mi
Ãºnica esperanza


Implora
Narottam das, por recibir su gracia


 


TRANSLATION


1)
When will that opportune moment come to us, when there will be shivering of the
body as soon as we chant Lord Gauranga's name?  While chanting Hare Krsna,
when will there be tears in the eyes? 


 


2)
When will I obtain the mercy of Lord Nityanandacandra?  When, by His mercy
will the desire for material enjoyment become very insignificant? 


 


3)
When the mind is completely purfied, being freed from material anxieties and
desires, then I shall be able to understand Vrndavana and the conjugal love of
Radha and Krsna, and then my spiritual life will be successful. 


 


4)
When shall I be very much eager to study the books left by the Six Gosvami's,
headed by Srila Rupa Gosvami and Srila Raghunatha dasa Gosvami?  By their
instruction I shall be able to properly understand the loving affairs of Radha
and Krsna. 


 


5)
My only aspiration is to attain the lotus feet of the Six Gosvamis headed by
Srila Rupa Gosvami and Srila Raghunatha dasa Gosvami.  Narottama dasa constantly
prays to attain their lotus feet.
