LYRICS:


(1)


vidyāra
vilāse, kāṭāinu kāla,

parama sāhase āmi

tomāra caraṇa, nā bhajinu kabhu,

ekhona śaraṇa tumi


 


(2)


poḍite
poḍite, bharasā bārilo,

jÃ±āne gati habe māni'

se āśā biphala, se jÃ±āna durbala,

se jÃ±āna ajÃ±āna jāni


 


(3)


jaḍa-vidyā
jata, māyāra vaibhava,

tomāra bhajane bādhā

moha janamiyā, anitya saḿsāre,

jīvake koraye gādhā


 


(4)


sei
gādhā ho'ye, saḿsārera bojhā,

bahinu aneka kāla

bārdhakye ekhona, śaktira abhāve,

kichu nāhi lāge bhālo


 


(5)


jīvana
jātanā, hoilo ekhona,

se vidyā avidyā bhelo

avidyāra jwālā, ghaṭilo biṣama,

se vidyā hoilo śelo


 


(6)

saḿsāre nā āche āra

bhakativinoda, jaḍa-vidyā chāḍi,'

tuwā pada kore sāra

FOR WORD TRANSLATION: 
Vidyara
Vilase


 


TRANSLATION


1)
With great enthusiasm I spent my time in the pleasures of mundane learning, and
never worshiped Your lotus feet, O Lord. Now You are my only shelter.


 


2)
Reading on and on, my hopes grew and grew, for I considered the acquisition of
material knowledge to be life's true goal. How fruitless those hopes turned out
to be, for all my knowledge proved feeble. Now I know that all such erudition
is actually pure ignorance.


 


3)
All the so-called knowledge of this world is born of the flickering potency of
Your illusory energy (maya). It is an impediment to the execution of devotional
service to You. Indulgence in mundane knowledge verily makes an ass of the
eternal soul by encouraging his infatuation with this temporary world.


 


4)
Here is one person who has been turned into such an ass, who for so long has
carried on his back the useless burden of material existence. Now in my old
age, for want of the power to enjoy, I find that nothing at all pleases me.


 


5)
Life has now become agony, for my so-called erudite knowledge has proven itself
to be worthless ignorance. Material knowledge has now become a pointed shaft
and has pierced my heart with the intolerable, burning pain of ignorance.


 


6)
O Lord, there is no treasure worth seeking in this world other than Your lotus
feet. Bhaktivinoda abandons all his mundane knowledge and makes Your lotus feet
the sum and substance of his life.
