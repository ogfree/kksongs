TRANSLATION


1)
What austerities did the hundreds of thousands of eternal holy places perform
to please Krsna and obtain from Him the benediction to live at Krsna kunda, the
rarest holy place? Let us glorify residence at Krsna kunda.


 


2) If
even the Arista demon was able to enter Krsna kunda, then crooked hearted
persons such as us may also be able to live there. Let us glorify residence at
Krsna kunda which, on the pretext of death, grants a wonderful form of
liberation.


 


3)
When Radha said, "To atone for killing a cow (Aristasura) You must visit
millions of holy places in the three worlds," Krsna called all the holy
places and then happily bathed in the lake that sprang from His heel. Let us
glorify residence at Krsna kunda.


 


4) At
some holy places one becomes free from all sins, at other sone becomes free
from the bondage of karma, at others one attains Brahman happiness, and at
others one attains residence in Visnuloka. Let us glorify residence at Krsna
kunda, where without any effort one attains the jewel of pure love for Krsna.


 


5)
Krsna kunda is surrounded by groves of mango, kadamba and other trees with many
madhavis and other vines. There is the music of cakravakas, cuckoos, and bees.
At night there are millions of inconceivable sweet fragrances. Let us glorify
residence at Krsna kunda.


 


6)
With gopi friends the two crowns of youth enjoyed many pastimes there. They
rode on a swing, danced wonderful rasa dances, sang, played instrumental music,
and talked. In a secluded place They eagerly drank the nectar of a flower
battle. Let us glorify residence at Krsna kunda.


 


7)
With the beauty of its glistening jewel shores and the splendor of its canopies
and mosaic pavements it brings auspiciousness toall eyes. Let us glorify
residence at Krsna kunda.


 


8) The
district of Mathura, Krsna's birthplace, is more sacred and difficult to attain
than Vaikuntha. The forest where He lived is more sacred still, and the hill
lifted by His hand is more sacred than that. More sacred than that is Lord
Hari's very purifying lake nearby. Let us glorify residence at Krsna kunda.


 


9) May
he who reads these eight verses, which convince one to reside at the shore of
Krsna kunda, and who also plunges his mind in the lotus flowers of Sri Sri
Radha Giridhari's feet, quickly attain sincere love for Them.
