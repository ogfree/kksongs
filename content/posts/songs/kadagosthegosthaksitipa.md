TRANSLATION


1)
Even though her eyes were filled with tears as she caressed her playful son,
and even though Rohini largely blocked her view, Mother Yasoda carefully noted
the entrance of Sri Radha. When will I humbly offer betelnuts to Visakha's
friend, Sri Radha?


 


2)
When, again and again taking jewels from the boÃ¸ and placing them in Sri
Radha's hand as in Her home She and Her friends make necklaces for Lord Hari,
will the vine of my hand bear fruit?
Â Â Â Â Â 



 


3)
When will Sri Radha, my queen happily playing with the cuckoos, bees, and other
citizens in Her pastime-kingdom of Vraja's forest, fill me with transcendental
bliss?


 


4)
Stringing flower garlands with three or four friends by the Yamuna's shore,
Radha bends down. Hiding Krsna suddenly approaches and earnestly tries to
embrace Her. She resists, knitting Her eyebrows. When will I fan Sri Radha as
She enjoys these pastimes?
Â Â Â Â  


 


5)
In the splendid rasa dance arena on the sandy shore Lord Hari became a
blue-lotus testing-stone to test the value of a host of golden-complexioned
girls intoxicated with pride. When will Sri Radha, the greatest treasure among
them, delight us all?


 


6)
When will this person draw a picture of Radha's beloved Krsna? When will this
person give the picture to the flowering vine that is Visakha's dear friend
Radha' as She sits with Her friends on thrones of flowers deep in beautiful
Bhandiravana Forest? When will this person show that picture to Krsna?
Â Â Â Â  


 


7)
When in a solitary place at the top of a mountain will She point out the
various cottages of flowering vines and recount the pastimes She enjoyed there?
When, filled with happiness, embarassment, will She eagerly ask me a question in
stuttering words?
Â Â Â  


 


8)
This lake is my eternal home. It is everything for Radha's friends. It is
filled with the glory of Radha's love for Krsna. Krsna loves it as much as He
loves Radha. I pray that at this lake Lalita's friend Radha may eternally enjoy
pastimes before my eyes.
Â Â Â
