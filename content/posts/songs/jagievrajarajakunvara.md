TRANSLATION


Refrain: O young prince of 
Vraja
! Wake up, it
is morning and lotus-flowers are blooming in the ponds. The 
Kumudanī

flowers are collapsing and bumble bees are getting out from creepers (to get to
lotuses and flowers.)


 


1) All the birds are chirping loudly and 
You

can also hear the rooster shout. The cow in barn is running towards her calf to
feed it.


 


2) The moon is without shine now in the presence of resplendent sun and
people are singing the morning chants and eulogies. O 
Śyāma

of 
Sūradāsa
! Wake up, You, Who holds a
lotus flower!
