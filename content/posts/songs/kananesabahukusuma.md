TRANSLATION


1) Flowers bloom in the
forest. Parrots and cuckoos sweetly talk.


 


2) Peacocks and peahens
loudly call. These sounds make one wild with bliss.


 


3) Look! Look! There is the
king of playful heroes. He walks to the forest-place where He will meet His
beloved.


 


4) He sits on a couch of
twigs and leaves. He thirsts to enjoy pastimes with His beloved.


 


5) He watches the path. His
life's breath is uneasy. The beautiful 
gopi
 has not
yet come.


 


6) 
Kamadeva

is manifest in His heart. 
Govinda
 
dasa

carefully watches the four directions.

song is sung in Raga Sri.
