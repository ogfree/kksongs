TRANSLATION


(Refrain)
Glory, glory to the Lord who is the goddess of fortune's shelter, who is the
abode of all virtues, and whose sweet holy name carries the nectar-elixir of
spiritual love, an elixir that rescues the poor fallen souls!


 


1)
Lord 
Krsna
, who is 
Nanda's

son, the 
gopis
' beloved, 
Radha's

lover, a hero of amorous pastimes, and dark in complexion, now has become 
Saci's
 son. He is the ruler of 
Nadiya
.
He charms the hearts of the demigods and sages.


 


2)
Glory to the Lord, whose bodily complexion is now like that of His beloved!
Glory, glory to the Lord, who enjoys pastimes of feeling the ecstatic spiritual
love His 
beloved
 feels! Glory to the Lord who brought
auspicious bliss to the 
vraja-gopis
' eyes and who now
delights the eyes of the girls in 
Nadiya
!


 


3)
Glory, glory to the Lord whose form is dark like a new rain cloud and who is
the ecstatic friend of 
Sridama
, 
Sudama
,

Subala
, and 
Arjuna
! Glory
to the Lord who was the dear and glorious companion of 
Balarama

and a host of 
gopa
 boys! Glory, glory to the Lord who
now manifests a fair form charming and peerless!


 


4)
Glory, glory to the Lord who was 
Balarama's
 dear
younger brother! Glory, glory to the Lord who now delights 
Nityananda
!
Glory, glory to the Lord who breaks into pieces the fears of the saintly
devotees! Glory to the Lord whose association 
Govinda


dasa
 yearns to attain!


 


5)
Glory to the Lord whose graceful form is now more splendid than gold, who is
gloriously arrayed in silken garments. Describing the glories of the holy name,
He speaks from 
Srimad-Bhagavatam
. His form is now
fair.


 


6)
He is accompanied by His devotees. Now His lotus feet are visible in this
world. Without stop the holy names Â“
Radhe
! 
Krsna
! 
Govinda
!" are
gloriously manifest in His mouth.


 


7)
He relishes the nectar of the divine couple's qualities, pastimes, and
devotional service. The 
kalpa-taru
 tree of scriptures
He holds in His hand. O Supreme Lord, but for 
You
 who
will give shelter to fallen helpless 
Govinda
 
dasa
?
