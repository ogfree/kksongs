TRANSLATION:


1-2)
Whatever I am, whatever I possess, I offer at Your lotus feet, O merciful Lord.
I no longer belong to myself. Now I am exclusively Yours.


 


3) The
soul inhabiting this mortal body has given up the false ego attached to the word
Â“IÂ”, and now the eternal, spiritual sense of being Yours has entered his heart.


 


4-5)
All my possessions - body, brothers, friends, and followers, wife, sons,
personal belongings, house and home- all of these I give You, for I have become
Your servant. Now I dwell in Your house.


 


6) You
are the Lord of my house, and I Your most obedient servant. Your happiness is
my only endeavor now.


 


7)
Whatever piety or sins were done by me, by mind or deed, are no longer mine,
for I am redeemed


 


8) My desire
has become one with Yours. From this day Bhaktivinoda has no other identity.
