TRANSLATION


Refrain:
O beautiful one! O youthful boy who lives in my heart! Please come to me, O
dark Syamal, O delighter of my eyes!


 


1)
The desire of my heart is to worship You intimately. In this hope, I humbly bow
unto Your lotus feet.


 


2)
O love of my eyes! Please take me with You! While I am suffering in Your
separation, the melody of our impending meeting is the only thing that gives me
any happiness. O monarch of my life! Why do You remain silent and never speak
to me? Tears are flowing from my eyes, and nothing in this world gives me any
satisfaction.


 


3)
How much longer must I continue living in this condition? You are making me
weep and cry out for You, O darling Giridhari Lal! If I cannot attain You in
this lifetime, then I shall just give up and surrender myself unto death.
