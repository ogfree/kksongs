TRANSLATION


(Refrain)

SaciÂ’s
 son is the life of everyone in this world. In
life or death Lord 
Gaura
 is my master.


 


1)
Accompanied by His associates, the master of 
Goloka
,
 has descended to 
Navadvipa
. He established 
sankirtana
-dharma,
the duty for this age. He sang, danced, and taught.


 


2)
He manifested a form glorious like gold. He wore a 
kaupina

and outer garments glorious like the sunrise. Turning aside from any desire to
stay with 
Visnupriya
, He carried a 
danda
 and 
kamandalu
 in His hands.


 


3)
He was Lord 
Krsna
, the master of all the worlds. He
became the guru of this world. He chanted the mantras of the holy names.
Because of Him the blasphemers who committed great offenses came to worship
Lord 
Narayana
 and chant His holy names.


 


4)
He traveled to 
Orissa
, manifested a six-armed form,
and taught the chanting of the holy names. 
Ananta
 
Acarya
 says: Surrounded by his devotees, He resided in 
Nilacala
.
