TRANSLATION


1)
Lord Gauranga, the personification of ecstatic love of God, dances in the
company of His plenary portions, along with the parts and parcels of His
plenary portions, with His divine weapons, and with His personal associates.


 


2) The
son of Mother Saci wanders throughout the abode of Nadiya singing the holy
names of Krsna, which are the deliverer of all living beings imprisoned within
the age of Kali, as follows:


 


3)
"O Lord Hari! Obeisances unto Hari, who is Krsna, the best of the Yadus,
the herder of the cows, the pleasure of the cows, the supreme enjoyer, and the
blessed killer of the demon named Madhu."
