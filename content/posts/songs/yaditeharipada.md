TRANSLATION


1)
If you want you heart to be always absorbed in drinking the ambrosial mellows
of the lotus feet of Lord Hari, then give up household life, which is full of
quarrels and strife, and just worship Lord Gaura, the moon of GodrumaÂ’s forest
bowers.


 


2)
Material riches, youth, long duration of life, and royal happiness Â— none of these
are eternal. At any moment they may be destroyed. Give up all useless topics of
mundane conversation and just worship Lord Gaura, the moon of GodrumaÂ’s forest
bowers.


 


3)
O Friend, ultimately the pleasure to be had in the company of beautiful young women
turns to fearfulness and distracts one from the real goal of life. Just worship
Lord Gaura, the moon of GodrumaÂ’s forest bowers with your mind intoxicated by
the nectarine mellows of the holy name.


 


4)
The taste of mundane poetry does not afford the sweet taste of actual poetry.
The sweet mellows of true poetry are found in descriptions of Lord Caitanya,
the savior of all souls in the Kali yuga. Enough with the study of any other
topics! Just worship Lord Gaura, the moon of GodrumaÂ’s forest bowers.


 


5)
Krishna, the transcendental paramour, stands on the banks of the Yamuna with
Radha, the daughter of Vrsabhanu, on His left side. He is absorbed in the
pastime of playing soft, melodious songs on His flute. Just worship Lord Gaura,
the moon of GodrumaÂ’s forest bowers, Lord Caitanya, who is non-different from
the son of Nanda.


 


6)
He is Lord Hari, shining like molten gold and surrounded by His loving devotees
in the midst of hari-kirtana, He is the only ocean of mercy for the Gaudiya
Vaisnavas. Just worship Lord Gaura, the moon of GodrumaÂ’s forest bowers.


 


7)
Just worship Lord Gaura, the moon of GodrumaÂ’s forest bowers Â— Lord Caitanya,
who along with His beloved wife Visnu-priya is glorified by all demigods and
saintly persons. His home, Navadvipa, is surrounded by the river Ganga, the
daughter of the Himalayas. He is the Lord of Navadvipa and the stealer of the
hearts of all sannyasiÂ’s.


 


8)
Lord Gauranga is like a powerful hammer which smashes the sin and oppression of
the mad-dog of the Kali-yuga. He is absorbed in distributing the holy name of
Krishna, which is the greatest medicine to release one from the material
existence. His transcendental form is beautiful, and His heart is full of
compassion for the suffering, fallen souls of this world. Just worship Lord
Gaura, the moon of GodrumaÂ’s forest bowers.


 


9)
Compassion which is free from the duality of Â“FriendÂ” and Â“enemyÂ” is always
manifest of his lotus face. He is the son of Maharaja Nanda Â— Krishna, who has
appeared in a golden form in the land of Navadvipa. Just worship Lord Gaura,
the moon of GodrumaÂ’s forest bowers.


 


10)
In this world and in the Upanishads He is celebrated as the all-pervading
Supreme Lord. He appeared as the son of a brahmana and is Lord Hari Himself,
with a shining complexion of molten gold. In His own abode He sports with His
cowherd boy friends. Just worship this Lord Gaura, the moon of GodrumaÂ’s forest
bowers.


 


11)
He is the most wonderful of all avataras because He is the source of all other
expansions of God. He is the Supreme Truth, enjoying His pastimes here in this
world. He is the embodiment of the most confidential flows that exist in the
ocean of rasa.


 


12)
Without strong devotional worship and service, mere mundane scholarship, high
family lineage , wealth and so on are not effective for invoking the causeless
mercy of the Lord. O friend, just worship Lord Gaura, the beautiful moon of
GodrumaÂ’s forest bowers, by the path of unmotivated devotion.


 


13)
In His appearance as Hari, the Lord liberated Gajendra, the king of elephants,
from the grasp of the crocodile in the lake, and in His appearance as Sri
Caitanya, He delivered King Gajapati Prataparudra from the jaws of the
kali-yuga crocodile who was lying in the lake of politics. Lord Sri Caitanya is
unborn, possesses inconceivable power ,and is likened to an auspicious desire
tree. Just worship Lord Gaura, the moon of GodrumaÂ’s forest bowers.


 


14)
Lord Krsna, who was pleased with the penances and austerities of Indra and the
Surabhi cow, appeared in this world as Lord Caitanya, possessing a golden
complexion. He is eternal happiness and the captivator of the intelligence of
all learned sages. Just worship Lord Gaura, the moon of GodrumaÂ’s forest bowers.


 


15)
Give up all worldly desires, monistic meditation and relative conceptions of
inauspiciousness and auspiciousness. In a favorable mood, with loving devotion,
just engage yourself in just worshipping Lord Gaura, the moon of GodrumaÂ’s
forest bowers.


 


16)
Remaining devoted to the service of the VaisnavaÂ’s, being addicted to drinking
the sweet nectar of the name of Hari, and with a mentality endowed with
modesty, humility, and compassion, just worship Lord Gaura, the moon of
GodrumaÂ’s forest bowers.


 


17)
Always worship Lord Gaura, the beautiful moon of GodrumaÂ’s forest bowers, and
call out to the Lord,Â” O Yadava, ! O Madhava O Krishna, O Hari, O Rama O
Janardana, O Keshava, O beloved Lord of Radha!Â”


 


18)
Just worship Lord Gaura, the moon of GodrumaÂ’s forest bowers and call out to
the Lord Â“O Lord of the Vrndavana forest, which lies along the banks of the
Yamuna! O Lord of Govardhana Hill! O sun of the forest of Gokula! O giver of
life to the rasa dance! O Gaurahari!


 


19)
Go to Navadvipa, the land of Lord Caitanya, Read and recite with great joy the
wonderful pastimes of Lord Gaurahari. Roll about in ecstasy on the banks of the
Ganges, which are marked with the footprints of Lord Caitanya, and just worship
Lord Gaura, the moon of GodrumaÂ’s forest bowers. Remember the wonderful
pastimes of Gaura and Gadadhara.


 


20)
Remember the pastimes of Gaura and Gadadhara. Become a servant of Gaura and
Gadadhara. Listen to the beautiful narrations concerning Gaura and Gadadhara
and just worship Lord Gaura, the moon of GodrumaÂ’s forest bowers.
