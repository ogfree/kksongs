REMARKS/EXTRA
INFORMATION:


This
bhajan can be sung in two choruses, as a call and response. One chorus can sing
the Â“
giri-pūjeyaḿ vihitaḿ
kena
Â”
part as the Â“callÂ”, while the other chorus sings the remainder of the line as
the response.


 


Right
before the song in the original text, Srila Jiva Goswami indicates that the cowherd
women sang in a call and response: half of them would sing the question
portion, while in the remaining half, one by one, the cowherd woman would sing the
response portion.
