TRANSLATION


1) O 
Krsna
,
affectionate to 
Your
 devotee and pleased by his word,
with a cheerful You gave Your mercy to Lord Brahma. You delighted him with 
Your
 smiling glance and gave him permission to depart.


 


2) O 
Krsna
,
You awakened the calves and cowherd boys from their slumber, placed then in 
Vrndavana
 as before, and brought the calves to the shore of
the 
Yamuna
. O Lord Who performs wonderful activities;
I offer respectful 
obeisances
 unto 
You
.


 


3) O 
Krsna
,
You laugh and smile, hearing the joking words of the charming and innocent
cowherd boys. O festival for the houses of 
Vraja
,
Your appearance and 
Your
 pastimes are very colorful
and astonishing and You delight the hearts of the 
gopis
.


 


4) O 
Krsna
,
O best friend of all living entities, 
You
 are more
dear (to the devotees) than their own selves. The nature of the ocean of pure
love for 
You
 was determined and ascertained in the
conversation of King 
Pariksit
 and 
Sukadeva


Gosvami
.


 


5) O 
Krsna
,
You are expert at performing 
Your
 astonishing pastimes
in Your own abode. You play the games of constructing a bridge and of jumping
up and down like a frog. O Lord, please protect me.
