TRANSLATION


(Refrain)
O beautiful girl, 
Krsna
 talks about You. Separated
from You, His body has become emaciated. At every moment He is distraught. Fate
is tormenting Him.


 


1)
He gazes at the moon. He anoints his limbs with sandal paste. Still He cannot
tolerate the flames of His fever. He cannot wear His white shawl. How can he
meet with You?


 


2)
Wishing to hide in the darkness, He plays the 
alap
 of
Raga 
Megha
 
Malhara
 on His
flute. As the clouds come and go, He deeply sighs.


 


3)
He sings of Your virtues. It is only by chanting 
japa

of Your name that He lives. The hairs of His body stand erect. 
Govinda
 
dasa
 says: These symptoms
are not surprising. Are they not the signs of new love?


 


REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:


This
song is sung in Raga Sri.
