TRANSLATION


Refrain:
O mind, just worship the lotus feet of the bonafide spiritual master. 


 


1)
Without receiving the mercy of the pure devotee, one will not have the potency
to execute regulative spiritual practices. Therefore, O my dear mind, I urge
you to worship him, please worship him at every moment.


 


2) O
mind, just worship the lotus feet of the bonafide spiritual master. While the
fallen soul wanders throughout the fourteen worlds, it rarely gets an
opportunity to receive a human birth. And out of so many human beings, only a
few receive the great fortune of meeting the devotees of Lord Hari.


 


3) O
mind, just worship the lotus feet of the bonafide spiritual master. Sri Guru is
the personification of the bliss inherent in KrsnaÂ’s causeless mercy, and he is
therefore the abode of mercy for souls who are suffering in the material world.
He is the revealer of transcendental knowledge, pure devotion, and divine love.
Sri Guru is the savior of fallen conditioned souls.


 


4) O
mind, just worship the lotus feet of the bonafide spiritual master. His glories
are clearly confirmed by the assembly of sruti sastras, smrti-sastras, as well
as in the commentaries of the great acaryas. Just offer your body, mind, and
life itself at the lotus feet of Sri Guru and always remain engaged in the
chanting of Hari Nama.
