TRANSLATION


1)
Lord Gaurasundara, who is beyond the view of the scriptures, beyond the entire
Brahman, and above even the Vedas, can never be known by the atheists whose
intelligence is dull.


 


2)
Lord Nityananda is His eternal self. Lord Caitanya is Lord Govinda Himself and
Pandita Gadadhara is none other than Sri Radha. The divine couple, who are
present in Sri Caitanya, are a well of rasa. 


 


3)
Advaita Acarya (Sadasiva) has prayed for His descent. Within He is blackish but
of a golden hue without, the manifestation of the divine couple.


 


4)
Thus Vasudeva Ghosa sings of the beauty of this divine couple - Sri
Gaura-Gadadhara - in whose worship he has been completely subjugated. He prays
that he will desire to serve them birth after birth.Â”
