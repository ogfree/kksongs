TRANSLATION


(Refrain) 
Radha
, make 
Your
 heart kind. He
who is the life of 
Gokula
 is now wounded, His heart
pierced by the arrow of 
Your
 sidelong glance.


 


1) His flute has now become
like a swan in the lotus flower of His left hand, a swan accustomed to sing the
fifth note, but now silent out of great pain. 


  


2) His forest-flower
garland, once very fragrant and attractive to swarms of black bees, has now
wilted and fallen from His neck to the forest ground. 


 


3) O merciless girl, His
transcendental form, which delights 
Sanatana
 
Gosvami's
 heart, has now stopped its pastimes, and has now
become very thin, slowly withering away in a mountain cave.


 


REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:


Srila
 
Jiva
 
Gosvami

explains that 
Visakha
 sings this song to 
Srimati
 
Radharani
. It is sung in
Raga 
Malhara
