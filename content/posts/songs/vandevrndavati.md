TRANSLATION


1)
Those aspirant practitioners who have first had profound meditation on the
purport of great statements like "tattvamasi", etc., and who have
attained unity with the bliss of merging into the Brahmana effulgence,
themselves find that such so-called bliss is put to shame before the completely
ecstatic spiritual relationship between the taster and tasted mellows. I offer
my respectful obeisances unto that most astonishing abode of such totally
blissful mellows, the very moon over Vrndavana: Sri Krsna, Who is the
delightful festival for Sri Radhika's eyes.


 


2)
I offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu, which are the only shelter for all of the greatly fortunate devotees
of Lord Krsna. His lotus feet cast out to a distant place the unbearable burden
of the doctrine of undifferentiated monism, as it was propounded by Sripada
Sankaracarya.


 


3)
I offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of my most worshipable
Gurudeva, who is the personified form of blissful Krsna consciousness. Jut to
increase his transcendental happiness; I will compose the book known as
"Kalyan Kalpa-taru".


 


4)
The aggregate of the following 24 elements I called "prakrti": the 5
gross elements, the 5 objects of the senses, the 5 working senses, the 5
knowledge-acquiring senses, mind, intelligence, ego, and mahattattva. The truth
that is above and beyond all these is called "transcendental truth".
That truth although being the original reservoir of all blissful spiritual
mellows, is not appreciated by all persons, indeed, those who have not
developed unalloyed love and attachment to this transcendental truth will not
read this book, which is just like a small jewel box for guarding the most confidential
gems of ecstatic love. Thus they simply remain attached to meditating on
material bodily happiness, becoming completely submerged and drowned in the
insignificant ocean of lust.


 


5)
In the abode of Vaikuntha, within the forest of ultimate good, there is one
special wish-fulfilling desire tree of supreme auspiciousness, conspicuously
present among all the others.


 


6)
This tree is divided into three principle branches known as "Upadesa"
(spiritual advice), "Upalabdhi" (attainment of realization), and
"Ucchvasa" (overflowing spiritual emotions), which increase the joy
of all persons who are actually wise.


 


7)
The shelter of this special desire-tree produces the attainment of fruits in
the form of auspiciousness. This means eternal servitude to the performance of
Sri-Sri-Radha-Krsna's pastimes in the realm of the transcendental forest named
Vrndavana, within the innermost secret abode of Vaikuntha.


 


8)
I now humbly perform the chanting of all the songs which are sheltered under
the mood of Vraja, just to worship all of Lord Krsna's jiva souls. This
includes all the Vaisnava residents of Vraja-dhama, Ksetra-dhama, and
Navadvipa-dhama, as well as all the brahmanas who are beyond fruitive
activities and speculative knowledge, as well as all the souls from Lord Brahma
down to the untouchable outcastes and dogs.


 


REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:


This
is the only song in Sanskrit in the Kalyana Kalpataru. (The Kalyana Kalpataru
is composed in Bengali.)
