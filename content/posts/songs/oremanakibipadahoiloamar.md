TRANSLATION


1-2) Oh my dear mind,
 just see what calamity has befallen me now! My soul
is captured in a perverted delirium due to 
maya's

cruel tyrannical treatment, which burns me with material miseries just like
fire. A with a hope of becoming freed from all this, I took to the path of
non-dual monistic 
mayavada
 philosophy, which finishes
all of 
maya's
 troubles when one merges with the
"oneness". Thus drinking poison, I have successfully become rid of
the disturbing delirium of 
maya
. But just see what an
unfortunate mishap has arisen now! Although the difficulties caused by the
material world have been eradicated, my life is now being vanquished by the
burning poison of threat deadly 
mayavada
 philosophy.


 


3)
By thinking "I am only spirit", one certainly burns up any attachment
to the material body. But is that the real final remedy, oh mind, my dear
brother? Certainly it is good that the disturbance of material tribulations has
been relieved, but the so-called "medicine" of the 
mayavada
 philosophy has now become an unwanted burden,
another trouble all over again. So now tell me where you will get the medicine
which will cure this "medicine"?


 


4)
These two dangers: 1) nasty troubles given by 
maya
,
and 2) the poisonous burden of 
mayavada
 philosophy,
can be prevented and curbed completely by taking the nice prescription medicine
recommended by the devotee-physicians. And that ecstatic prescription is to
drink with gusto the immortal nectar of 
harinama
 at
the divine lotus feet of Sri Krsna 
Caitanya
 
Mahaprabhu
.
