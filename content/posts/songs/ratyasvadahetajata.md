TRANSLATION


1)
All the things which cause one to taste his attachment to the Lord are called 
vibhava
 (special stimulants). The two divisions of these
causes are called: 1) 
alambana
 (the persons who are
foundations of support, and between whom love appears reciprocally), and 2) 
uddipana
 (the exciting factors which stimulate the
awakening of love). There are also two sides to the 
alambana

foundations 1) 
visayathe
 subject of love: Krsna) and
2) 
asraya
 (the object of love: 
Krsna's

devotee).


 


2)
Lord Krsna Himself is full of all good qualities, for He is the most
outstanding Hero amongst all heroes. He is the eternal reservoir of all
virtuous qualities, and is the Supreme Greatest of the greatest. There are
many, many devotees who are very much attached to Krsna in ecstatic love. These
devotees are also full of transcendental qualities themselves. Some of them are
known as 
siddha
 (spiritually perfect), whereas others
are 
sadhaka
 (neophyte practitioners).


 


3)
All the things which stimulate the awakening of ecstatic emotions are called 
uddipana
. This includes 
Krsna's

enchanting smile, His sweet bodily fragrance, His buffalo horn, His flute, His 
conchshell
, His place of residence, the buzzing of the bees
in 
Vraja
, the marks on the soles of His lotus feet,
His ankle bells, and the soft sweet sound of His voice and flute.


 


4)
Other causes are the association of 
Srimati
 
Tulasi
 
Devi
, the various symbols
and practices of devotional service, and the vision of the Lord's bona fide
representatives and devotees. In this way, there are many factors to stimulate
ecstatic love. And all these causes, which induce one to taste the mellow of
devotion, have been clearly described by 
Srila
 
Rupa
 
Gosvami
 and 
Srila
 
Sanatana
 
Gosvami
.
