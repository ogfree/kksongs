TRANSLATION


1)
O 
Krsna
, appearing to be so youthful, the residents
of 
Vraja
 considered that 
You

were younger than You actually were. O Lord, O performer of greatly wonderful
pastimes, the conversation of King 
Pariksit
 and 
Sukadeva
 
Gosvami
 about Your
pastimes appears just like a reservoir of enchanting nectar.


 


2)
O 
Krsna
,

decorated by the circle of Your cowherd boy friends, You sat on the grassy bank
on the shore of the celebrated and charming 
Yamuna

river, and took Your lunch.


 


3)
O 
Krsna
, surrounded by 
Your

friends, the young boys of 
Vraja
, You took Your lunch
together. You were clothed in a yellow dhoti, and decorated with a garland of
forest flowers. Your flute was tucked in at 
Your

waist. 


 


4)
O 
Krsna
, Your buffalo horn bugle and 
Your
 stick are placed in the left-side of Your belt, You
hold some curd in Your left hand and You appear very beautiful as You nibble at
Your lunch. O Lord, please be merciful unto me.


 


5)
O 
Krsna
, You held a fruit between 
Your

fingers and You enchanted the minds of the cowherd boys, causing them to laugh
at Your joking words. Your lunch-taking pastimes amazed the demigods in the
higher planetary system.


 


REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:


This song is based on 
Srimad


Bhagavatam
 Canto 10 Chapter 13.
