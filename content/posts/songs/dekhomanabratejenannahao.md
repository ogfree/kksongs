TRANSLATION


1) Be careful, my dear
mind, that you don't become bewildered by ritualistic vows. With an aim to
please 
Radha-Krsna
 and make 
Them

favorably disposed to you, you accept various types of austere vows. You
consider that this will be conducive to practicing devotional service.


 


2) Devotional service is
actually a very simple and easily understood truth, for it is the soul's
natural, inborn tendency. Your desire is to expand and enrich that devotion
which 
is already existing
 in your heart. But you
should be careful to consider that by undertaking unnecessarily difficult vows
and austerities, you don't destroy the simplicity of the natural 
bhakti
 process.


 


3) The results that you get
from hard labor on 
Krsna's
 behalf are extraordinary
and should never be considered to be commonplace. However, if such service
turns into an unnecessarily difficult austerity, then it becomes an obstacle to
devotion, and it will prevent you from getting the real benefit of devotion.
Instead, you will only get the benefit of the results of the austerity.


 


4) But just try to understand
this, my dear brother. If one is worshiping 
Hari
,
then there is no need to labor for penances and austerities. If devotional
service does not manifest as the result of some type of austerity, then the
insignificant result of that austerity will never be accepted by a true 
Vaisnava
 at any time.


 


5) From 
all
this,
 just try to understand the deep inner significance of the
principles of 
Vaisnava
 behavior. That is, according
to differences in receptivity of different persons, there is a definite difference
in their rightful capacity in devotional service. 
Bhaktivinoda's

humble submission is that you should just become a 
sara-grahi

and accept the essence of complete surrender to Krsna, thus becoming freed
from, and transcendental to, all types of scriptural rules and regulations.
