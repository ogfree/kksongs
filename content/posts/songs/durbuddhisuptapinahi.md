TRANSLATION


1) O Krsna, one day Your
friends saw a gigantic sleeping serpent (on the path). You earnestly desired to
protect Your innocent friends from that serpent, who was known as Aghasura,
whose mind was full of demoniac plans and who had performed many abominable
deeds.


 


2) O Krsna, You then became
very anxious (for the protection of Your friends). Entering within the demoniac
serpent Agha, You killed him, and thus saved the lives of the calves and the
cowherd boys.


 


3) O Krsna, in this way,
you delighted the demigods, liberated the offensive Agha demon, and amazed Lord
Brahma. O Lord, O ocean of amazing (pastimes), I offer respectful obeisances
unto You.
