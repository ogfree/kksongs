TRANSLATION


1) Fortunate 
Jagannatha
 
Misra
 and 
Saci-devi
 attained Lord 
Jagannatha

Himself as their son.


 


2) As 
Rahu

swallowed the moon in the month of 
Phalguna
, an
infant moon shone with great splendor in 
Saci's
 arms.


 


3) How much wealth, wealth
of yoga and worship, did 
Jagannatha
 
Misra
 then give in charity to the poor?


 


4) Although there were no
lamps, the maternity-room was filled with light. At that moment 
Navadvipa
 was filled with great bliss.


 


5) Demigods and humans
assembled at that place. The 
Gandharvas
 and 
Kinnaras
 sang and danced.


 


6) The Supreme Personality
of Godhead had personally come to remove the earth's burden. Now everyone was
filled with peerless bliss.


 


7) Turning away from
worldly things, everyone is now filled with love for Lord 
Gaura
.

Prema
 
dasa
 now floats in
bliss.
