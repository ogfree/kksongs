TRANSLATION


1) I take shelter of Lord 
Krsna
,
the master of all the worlds. I pray that some day I will see Him with my own
eyes. He is Lord 
Visnu
, embraced by the goddess of
fortune. He is the witness residing in the bodies of all moving and unmoving
beings. He is supremely pure. He is the killer of the demons. His eyes are
lotus flowers. He holds a club, 
conchshell
, and 
cakra
. He wears a glorious flower-garland. He is always
blissful and handsome.


 


2) I take shelter of Lord 
Krsna
,
the master of all the worlds. I pray that some day I will see Him with my own
eyes. From Him the sky, the wind, the universes, and all else were born. With a
fragment of His own bliss He protects all the worlds. He killed the 
Madhu
 demon. At the time of cosmic devastation with a
single fragment of His power He removes everything, taking it all within Him.
He is all-powerful.


 


3) I take shelter of Lord 
Krsna
,
the master of all the worlds. I pray that some day I will see Him with my own
eyes. The 
yamas
, 
niyamas
,
senses, and all else rest within His heart. The wise philosophers see that He
is the supreme object of worship, the magician that has manifested this world.


 


4) I take shelter of Lord 
Krsna
,
the master of all the worlds. I pray that some day I will see Him with my own
eyes. Standing in this world, He controls the earth, although this truth even
the earth itself does not understand. This the Vedas declare of Him. He is the
master of all the universes. He is supremely pure. He is the supreme
controller. He is the 
supereme
 object of meditation.
He gives liberation to the sages, demigods, and human beings.


 


5) I take shelter of Lord 
Krsna
,
the master of all the worlds. I pray that some day I will see Him with my own
eyes. By His power 
Indra
 and the demigods defeat the
demons. No one is independent of Him. Nothing ever happens without His sanction.
He removes the pride of they who are proud of their learning or their victory
over others.


 


6) I take shelter of Lord 
Krsna
,
the master of all the worlds. I pray that some day I will see Him with my own
eyes. A person who does not meditate on Him becomes a pig or some other beast.
A person who does not know anything about Him becomes afraid of repeated birth
and death. A person who does not remember Him is born as a worm for a hundred
births. He is the all-powerful Lord.


 


7) I take shelter of Lord 
Krsna
,
the master of all the worlds. I pray that some day I will see Him with my own
eyes. He cuts into pieces the fears and sufferings of the people. He is the
best of all shelters. He is the remover of illusions. He is dark like a rain
cloud. He is graceful and handsome. He is the friend of the boys in 
Vraja
. He is the friend of 
Arjuna
.
He is self-born. He is the father of all who are born. To all who act rightly
He gives the gift of happiness.


 


8) I take shelter of Lord 
Krsna
,
the master of all the worlds. I pray that some day I will see Him with my own
eyes. Whenever there is a decline of religion and the people of the worlds are
disturbed by troubles, then Lord 
Krsna
, who is the
unborn master of the worlds and the upholder of religious principles, manifests
His form in this world. He is the protector of the saintly devotees. He is
effulgent, pure, and handsome. He is glorified in all the scriptures. He is the
master of 
Vraja
.
