TRANSLATION


1)
He burns in the flames of love. Thinking and thinking of 
Your

proud jealous anger, He stays awake all day and all night. Although He is like 
Kamadeva's
 wild elephant, now He sits in the forest, thinks
of 
You
, and weeps.


 


2)
O angry 
gopi
, what fruit do 
You

think will come from Your proud jealous anger? You know 
Krsna

very well. His body is glorious like a dark monsoon cloud, and 
You
 are like a glistening lightning flash at His side.


 


3)
He wears bracelets of new flower-buds. He is anointed with sandal-paste. He is
adorned with lotuses. Now He is restless and cannot sleep. He rolls about on
the ground. Without You, He feels His body is licked by fire.


 


4)
Again and again 
You
 have tested Him and seen that He
loves You dearly. To attain You, He now worships 
Kamadeva

with offerings of 
campaka
 flowers. 
Govinda
 
dasa
 sings this song of
Lord 
Krsna's
 nectar pastimes.
