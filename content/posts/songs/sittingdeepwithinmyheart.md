LYRICS:


(1)


Sitting deep within my
heart, I think IÂ’ll be coming free


Trapped inside the walls of
the mind, darkness covering me


A sentence lasts many
lifetimes, but IÂ’ll never change my age


Forced by illusion, I think
I am the cage


 


(2)


Oh wise men! Wise men! What
is reality?


Oh wise men! Open my eyes!
Handing me the key!


Freedom from illusion, was
the matchless gift he gave


New worlds of life, truth,
and beauty opened within my mind


Transcendental land of
color never changed by time


Where the Reservoir of
Pleasure plays in bliss eternally


The Lord of love, Sri 
Govinda
, is calling out to me


 


(3)


Dear Krsna and 
Balarama
, can we go to the forest and play


Your mother, 
Yasoda
, is calling 
you,
 do you
have to go away?


Dear Krsna, You are so
enchanting, fragrant flowers within 
Your
 hair


The lovely lotus petal eyes
seek 
Radharani
, is 
She

there?


Dear Krsna, see the
peacocks dance, trying hard to catch 
Your
 style


The naughty, colored
butterflies seek the honey of 
Your
 smile


Dear Krsna and 
Balarama
, can we help 
You
 tend the
cows


Taking them to 
Madhuvana
, along the forest paths


Dear Krsna, can you take me
home, donÂ’t mind this humble plea


The low-lives turned away
from 
You
, only You can set me free
