TRANSLATION


1)
My dear mind, what kind of contemptible rubbish have you fallen into now?
Studying intensely in the schools of 
Navadvipa
, you
have been awarded the distinguished title of "
nyaya-ratna
"
(a jewel of a logician). Then, disguised as a 
Vaisnava
,
you indulge in long, dull arguments based on logic and reasoning, considering
such logic to be your best object of pursuit. However, such time-wasting
arguments are exactly like the meaningless croaking of a small frog in the
wilderness. In other words, such a sound is simply an unnecessary disturbance
to the ears.


 


2)
To support your deceptive hoax and to get a firm footing on a bogus
intellectual platform for oppressing and defeating others, you deliberate on an
aggregate of materialistic subjects such as knowledge of intrinsic word
meanings in relation to all the things which you can perceive within this
universe. However, the ultimate result of all your logical arguments and your
labeling of material objections simply like a dreadful poison, and you never
considered that this poisonous influence is extremely difficult to check.


 


3)
Just see, dear mind, your heart has indeed become as hard as a rock, and the
seed of the creeper of devotion cannot possibly grow in such a barren place. So
then how will you cross over this vast ocean of material existence? In this
position you can only guess about the nature of the Supreme Lord, just as a
clay pot maker will observe the vast creation. When the simple-minded potter
guesses about the Supreme, he thinks that the entire material creation is just
like a larger version of his own simple potter's wheel, and that the Lord is
the potter. In other words, by seeing a clay pot, you can guess that there must
have been a potter to make it in the first place. This philosophy is very crude
and contains no scope for developing love for the Supreme Lord.


 


4)
Renouncing your own natural 
samadhi
, and practically
worshiping that which you can prove by simply guessing (without actual
realization), 
Your
 heart has become devoutly attached
to arguing about such useless logic. Oh, to hell with all this rubbish logic!
It has not made a comfortable seat in my heart for Lord 
Krsna

to sit on.


 


5)
My dear mind, I advice you to constantly kick out such an unreasonable
argumentative mentality, and just worship the moon-like 
Krsna-candra
,
the Topmost Truth.
