TRANSLATION


1)
I offer my respectful obeisances unto the six Gosvamis, namely Sri Rupa Gosvami,
Sri Sanatana Gosvami, Sri Raghunatha Bhatta Gosvami, Sri Raghunatha dasa Gosvami,
Sri Jiva Gosvami, and Sri Gopala Bhatta Gosvami, who are always engaged in chanting
the holy name of Krsna and dancing. They are just like the ocean of love of
God, and they are popular both with the gentle and with the ruffians, because
they are not envious of anyone. Whatever they do, they are all-pleasing to
everyone, and they are fully blessed by Lord Caitanya. Thus they are engaged in
missionary activities meant to deliver all the conditioned souls in the
material universe.


 


2)
I offer my respectful obeisances unto the six Gosvamis, namely Sri Rupa Gosvami,
Sri Sanatana Gosvami, Sri Raghunatha Bhatta Gosvami, Sri Raghunatha dasa Gosvami,
Sri Jiva Gosvami, and Sri Gopala Bhatta Gosvami, who are very expert in
scrutinizingly studying all the revealed scriptures with the aim of
establishing eternal religious principles for the benefit of all human beings.
Thus they are honored all over the three worlds and they are worth taking
shelter of because they are absorbed in the mood of the gopis and are engaged
in the transcendental loving service of Radha and Krsna.


 


3)
I offer my respectful obeisances unto the six Gosvamis, namely Sri Rupa Gosvami,
Sri Sanatana Gosvami, Sri Raghunatha Bhatta Gosvami, Sri Raghunatha dasa Gosvami,
Sri Jiva Gosvami, and Sri Gopala Bhatta Gosvami, who are very much enriched in
understanding of Lord Caitanya and who are thus expert in narrating His
transcendental qualities. They can purify all conditioned souls from the
reactions of their sinful activities by pouring upon them transcendental songs
about Govinda. As such, they are very expert in increasing the limits of the
ocean of transcendental bliss, and they are the saviors of the living entities
from the devouring mouth of liberation.


 


4)
I offer my respectful obeisances unto the six Gosvamis, namely Sri Rupa Gosvami,
Sri Sanatana Gosvami, Sri Raghunatha Bhatta Gosvami, Sri Raghunatha dasa Gosvami,
Sri Jiva Gosvami, and Sri Gopala Bhatta Gosvami, who kicked off all association
of aristocracy as insignificant. In order to deliver the poor conditioned
souls, they accepted loincloths, treating themselves as mendicants, but they
are always merged in the ecstatic ocean of the gopis' love for Krsna and bathe
always and repeatedly in the waves of that ocean.


 


5)
I offer my respectful obeisances unto the six Gosvamis, namely Sri Rupa Gosvami,
Sri Sanatana Gosvami, Sri Raghunatha Bhatta Gosvami, Sri Raghunatha dasa Gosvami,
Sri Jiva Gosvami, and Sri Gopala Bhatta Gosvami, who were always engaged in
worshiping Radha-Krsna in the transcendental land of Vrndavana where there are
beautiful trees full of fruits and flowers which have under their roots all
valuable jewels. The Gosvamis are perfectly competent to bestow upon the living
entities the greatest boon of the goal of life.


 


6)
I offer my respectful obeisances unto the six Gosvamis, namely Sri Rupa Gosvami,
Sri Sanatana Gosvami, Sri Raghunatha Bhatta Gosvami, Sri Raghunatha dasa Gosvami,
Sri Jiva Gosvami, and Sri Gopala Bhatta Gosvami, who were engaged in chanting
the holy names of the Lord and bowing down in a scheduled measurement. In this
way they utilized their valuable lives and in executing these devotional
activities they conquered over eating and sleeping and were always meek and
humble enchanted by remembering the transcendental qualities of the Lord.


 


7)
I offer my respectful obeisances unto the six Gosvamis, namely Sri Rupa Gosvami,
Sri Sanatana Gosvami, Sri Raghunatha Bhatta Gosvami, Sri Raghunatha dasa Gosvami,
Sri Jiva Gosvami, and Sri Gopala Bhatta Gosvami, who were sometimes on the bank
of the Radha-kunda lake or the shores of the Yamuna and sometimes at Vamsivata.
There they appeared just like madmen in the full ecstasy of love for Krsna,
exhibiting different transcendental symptoms in their bodies, and they were
merged in the ecstasy of Krsna consciousness.


 


8)
I offer my respectful obeisances unto the six Gosvamis, namely Sri Rupa Gosvami,
Sri Sanatana Gosvami, Sri Raghunatha Bhatta Gosvami, Sri Raghunatha dasa Gosvami,
Sri Jiva Gosvami, and Sri Gopala Bhatta Gosvami, who were chanting very loudly
everywhere in Vrndavana, shouting, "Queen of Vrndavana, Radharani! O
Lalita! O son of Nanda Maharaja! Where are you all now? Are you just on the
hill of Govardhana, or are you under the trees on the bank of the Yamuna? Where
are you?" These were their moods in executing Krsna consciousness.
