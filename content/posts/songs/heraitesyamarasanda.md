TRANSLATION


(Refrain)
I gazed at Him. He was like a dark moon. The doorway of His chest and the great
bolts of His arms charm the most beautiful fair girls. His garments gently sway
to and fro.


 


1)
The dark circle of His face glistened in the sunlight. In drops of perspiration
His 
tilaka
 marking ran. When He walked with delicate
soft feet on the hot sandy pathway, I felt that I myself had burst into flames.


 


2)

Betelnuts
 and camphor are on His lips. With sandal
paste His limbs are anointed. Any graceful girl that touches His dark limbs
will find 
herseelf
 tossed to and fro by waves of 
prema
. 


 


3)
In a forest cottage He rests on a charming bed. Learned in all the scriptures,
the buzzing bees chant His glories. Fair 
Radha
 and
dark 
Krsna
 enjoy many blissful pastimes. So says 
Govinda
 
dasa
.


 


REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:


This
is sung in Raga 
Todi
.
