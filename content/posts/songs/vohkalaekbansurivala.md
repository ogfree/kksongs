TRANSLATION


(Refrain): That blackish
flute playing boy who left away. Our dear, that lad of 
Nanda

Maharaja, is the thief of butter! Where did the thief of the mind go?


 


1) I checked at the banks
of the 
Yamuna
 River, O dear, and I saw 
Krsna
. If I say anything, HeÂ’ll break my clay pot. Oh dear 
sakhi
, each time I try to plead and pray to Him, He will
not be willing to listen.


 


2) Remain quiet and listen
to Kana (a nickname of 
Krsna
). Where did the archer
who carries to bow go? I go to 
Goluka
 and search, as
well as in 
Mathura
. Which town did He go, 
which
 their fellow citizens would not Him go?
