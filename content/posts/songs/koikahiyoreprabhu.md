TRANSLATION


(Refrain) Oh! Someone said
that Lord 
Hari
 was coming. On His coming, my mind is
filled with 
bhava
.


 


1) But 
You

didnÂ’t come. You didnÂ’t send me a letter. I became obsessed with you. These two
eyes do not want to obey the fact. These eyes are flowing tears, just like the
river is flowing in rain.


 


2) What should I do? I have
no control on my end. I donÂ’t have wings that I could fly to 
You
.
Mira says Â“O Lord! Where will we meet?Â” My entire persona is offered unto 
You
.
