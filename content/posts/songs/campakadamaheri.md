TRANSLATION


1)
Â  
When He saw 
Your
 
campaka
 garland, 
Krsna
 was
overcome. Tears of love streamed from His eyes. Without stop He chants the
mantra of 
Your
 glories. My dear beautiful friend, He
loves 
You
 deeply.


 


2) O daughter of 
Vrsabhanu
, He chants the mantras of 
Your

glories day and night. He does not glorify any other girl. Millions and
millions of girls praise Him with sweet words, but even in His dreams 
Krsna
 does not love any girl but 
You
.


 


3)
Â  
He is the jewel of men, the best of lovers.
Overcome with love for You, He rolls on the ground. Does He love another girl?
He chants, "Ra!" Then He chants, "
Dha
!"
Then He is overcome and He has no power to say anything more. 
Then flooding streams of tears flow from His eyes.


 


4) 
Govinda


dasa
 falls at 
Your
 feet and
makes this request. Please give to 
Krsna
 a reply that
will show mercy to Him, a reply that will break His sufferings into pieces.
