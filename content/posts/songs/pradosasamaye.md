TRANSLATION


1) In the evening twilight,
within the privacy of 
Srivasa
 
Pandita's

courtyard, the cream-
lustered
 jewel, Lord 
Gauramani
, raised a most auspicious vibration by His
chanting of 
Hari-kirtana
, which He personally
accompanied by dancing in various playful moods.


 


2) Accompanied by the
paying of the 
mrdanga
 drum and 
karatalas
,
and amidst occasional victorious shouts of "
Jaya
!

Jaya
!Â” the dramatic dance of the Lord dispelled the
grief of all those who witnessed it.


 


3) Then, becoming madly
intoxicated in supreme ecstatic love, all the assembled devotees completely
forgot themselves and incessantly began to dance and chant wildly, surrounding
Lord 
Gauracandra
.


 


4) At this time, within the
inner chamber of 
Srivasa's
 house, one of his sons
suddenly died due to some disease, as ordained by the will of Providence. Due
to separation from the boy, all the women of the household began to lament and
cry out in a loud voice.


 


5) Now 
Bhaktivinoda

fears that the transcendental mellows of the Lord's 
kirtana

will be disturbed by the uprising of such loud crying sounds. However, 
Srivasa
 
Pandita
 has now
understood the cause of this sound, and has personally entered the house.
