LYRICS:


(1)


Look O
slender graceful gopi friend!


The
smiling charming glistening moon stepping down


From
the darkened night sky walks now in Sri Vraja's town.


Look
Now with a jesting smiling playful bend


 


(2)


Of His
eyebrows the restless, sweet poet moon seems to send


A
message with a playful, graceful frown.


Look
Now the sweet moon's peacock-feather crown


Moves
in the breeze Look Now the moving end


 


(3)


Of His
fingers dance on the flute and His smiling lips kiss


The
happily singing flute's mouth Look at the sweet


Nectar
moonlight that shines from His brow to His waist to His feet. 


 


(4)


Look
at necklace of colorful flowers that rest 


On the
glorious moon of His neck and His arms and His chest.


Look
Now the glistening moon fills the forest with bliss.
