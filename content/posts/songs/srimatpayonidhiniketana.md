TRANSLATION


1)
O 
Laksmi
 
Nrsimha
, whose
abode is the ocean of milk, who hold the (
sudarsana
)
discus in Your hand, whose pleasing form is adorned by the jewels that are the
hoods of 
Adi
 
Sesa
, who are
the Lord of the Yogis, the Eternal One, who provide protection to those who
seek it, the boat by which one crosses the ocean of miseries, provide me the
support of Your hands.


 


2)
Your lotus feet are touched by the tips of the crowns of Brahma, 
Indra
, 
Rudra
, the 
Maruts
 and 
Surya
. The brilliance
of 
Your
 lotus feet thus adds to Your effulgence, O
dear one! You are the King of swans sporting near the beautiful lotus breasts
of 
Laksmi
. O 
Laksmi
 
Nrsimha
, provide me the support of 
Your

hands.


 


3)
O 
Murari
 (enemy of Mura)! I have been tormented by
the fierce and terrifying lion called desire (
kama
) while wandering in the dense forest called worldly
existence. I have been scorched by the heat of the summer called envy (
matsara
). To me who have been thus afflicted, O 
Laksmi
 
Nrsimha
, do 
You
 provide the support of Your hands.


 


4)
Having reached the bottom of the unfathomable and extremely fearful well called
worldly existence, I have been troubled by the hundreds of serpents called
miseries. O 
Deva
! O 
Laksmi
 
Nrsimha
! To me who am helpless and who have reached this
wretched condition, do 
You
 provide the support of Your
hands.


 


5)
In the ocean that is worldly existence, my body has been eaten by large and
dreadful crocodiles and whales that are Time. I have been afflicted by the
waves called passion and attachment to the organ of taste. O 
Laksmi
 
Nrsimha
, provide me the
support of 
Your
 hands.


 


6)
The tree of worldly existence arises from the seed of sin. Its numerous
branches are the endless actions (karmas), its leaves are the organs of the
body, its flower is passion (
kama
), its fruit is sorrow. Having ascended this tree, I
am falling down. O compassionate 
Laksmi
 
Nrsimha
, provide me the support of 
Your

hands.


 


7)
Worldly existence is a serpent which has opened its gigantic mouth, revealing 
its
 most dreadful and sharp fangs filled with terrible
venom. This venom has burnt up my body and has destroyed it. O Lord whose
vehicle is 
Garuda
! O Lord whose abode is the ocean of
milk! O 
Sauri
! O 
Laksmi
 
Nrsimha
, provide me the support of 
Your

hands.


 


8)
In the forest conflagration of worldly existence (illusion), I have been burned
badly. Even every single hair on my body has been burned by large and fearful
columns of flames. In this condition I have sought the shelter of the cool lake
that is 
Your
 lotus feet. O 
Laksmi


Nrsimha
, provide me the support of 
Your

hands.


 


9)
I am like a fish, caught in the net of worldly existence. My palate and head
have been severely torn apart by the fish-hook that is the objects of the
senses. O Lord in whom the world resides! O 
Laksmi
 
Nrsimha
, provide me the support of 
Your

hands.


 


10)
The fearful rogue elephant of worldly illusion has struck me with its trunk,
completely crushing all my vital parts. I have been overcome by the fear of
worldly existence and death. O Destroyer of all suffering! O 
Laksmi
 
Nrsimha
, provide me the
support of 
Your
 hands.


 


11)
O Lord! My great wealth called power of discrimination (
viveka
)
has been stolen away by the powerful thieves called senses. I am blind (without
the power of discrimination between things eternal and 
noneternal
).
In this condition, I have been pushed into the dark well called delusion. O 
Laksmi
 
Nrsimha
, provide me the
support of 
Your
 hands.


 


12)
I have been bound by hundreds of snares of worldly attachments. The soldiers of

Yama
 (Death) have cast their noose around my neck and
are dragging me along, threatening me. I am alone, frightened, and without any
independence. O compassionate 
Laksmi
 
Nrsimha
, provide me the support of 
Your

hands.


 


13)
O Lord of 
Laksmi
, from whose navel emanates a lotus,
O Lord of gods, O Vishnu, O 
Vaikuntha
, O Krishna, O 
Madhusudana
 (slayer of 
Madhu
), O
Lotus-eyed One, O 
Brahmanya
 (the most exalted knower
of Brahman), O 
Kesava
, O 
Janardana
,
O 
Vasudeva
, O 
Laksmi
 
Nrsimha
, do You provide me the support of Your hands.


 


14)
In one hand 
You
 hold the (
sudarsana
)
discus; in another You hold the (
pancajanya
) conch;
another hand rests on (the waist of) the daughter of the ocean, 
Laksmi
; and the (fourth) hand signifies that You bestow
boons and drive away the fear (of the devotees). O 
Laksmi


Nrsimha
 
provide
 me the
support of Your hands.


 


15)
Being drowned in the ocean of worldly existence, I am deluded. O Lord! O
Treasure of compassion! Turn your glance toward me who am helpless. (Just as 
You
) assumed the Supreme avatar for the purpose of
eradicating the sorrow of 
Prahlada
, do You, 
Laksmi
 
Nrsimha
, provide me the
support of Your hands.


 


16)
You dwell in the hearts of the best of the 
Bhagavatas
,
such as 
Prahlada
, 
Narada
, 
Parashara
, 
Pundarika
, and 
Vyasa
. You are like the desire-fulfilling tree in
protecting the loyal devotees. O 
Laksmi
 
Nrsimha
, provide me the support of 
Your

hands.


 


17)
This auspicious hymn has been composed by 
Sankara
 who
is the bee engaged in drinking the nectar of the lotus feet of Sri 
Laksmi
 
Nrsimha
. In this world,
anyone who recites it will be filled with devotion to 
Hari

and will attain the undivided lotus feet of Brahman.
