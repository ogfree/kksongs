TRANSLATION


1)
Amongst the five divisions of 
Radharani's
 
sakhis
, four of these groups are 
nitya-siddha
,
or eternally situated in their roles. They did not have to perform any
ritualistic 
sadhana
 to achieve their position. The
fifth division known as Â“
sakhi
Â” consists of new 
gopis
 who have attained residence in 
Vraja

by dint of their 
sadhana
 practice.


 


2)
These 
sakhis
 are also of two varieties --- those
still situated in their 
sadhana
 practice as 
sadhaka
 
manjaris
, and those who
are already situated in their spiritual bodies beyond the rules of 
sadhana
. Thus those who attain perfection receive the body
of a 
gopi
 and continuously worship the Divine Couple
in spontaneous love.


 


3)
There are many great saints and devotees as well as the personified Upanishads
themselves who are all attracted by Lord Krsna, but who haven't accepted the
topmost perfection of receiving the form of a 
gopi
.
Although they are all definitely absorbed in their regulative worship of the
Lord, their eternal spiritual perfection still doesn't awaken fully, because
attainment of the mood of 
Vraja
 is a very uncommon
and rare perfection.


 


4)
But it is heard from authoritative sources that there are some great souls who
execute their worship in the mood of the 
gopis
,
catching a firm grip on the lotus feet of one of 
Radharani's

girlfriends. Then, by the power of that 
nitya-sakhi's

affectionate favor, one ultimately attains a residential place in that 
sakhi's
 own abode, where she eternally spends her time
waiting on the Divine Couple Sri 
Radha
 and Sri 
Hari
.


 


5)
Thus one becomes one of 
Radharani's
 eternal
girlfriends just to be able to render eternal service to the pleasure of Krsna
within the same abode of another 
sakhi
. This is all
due to voluntarily accepting the mood of that 
sakhi
.
This is actually the only real law which allows one entrance into 
Vraja
 --- that is, without the favor on another merciful 
gopi
, it is absolutely impossible for anyone to enter into
the ecstatic eternal service of the ecstatic eternal Lovers.
