TRANSLATION


1) You
call yourself a very great and venerable renunciant, but factually you are even
more of a sense-gratifier than those who are still householders. Furthermore,
you wear a loincloth for show, and carry tulasi beads in your hand, but like a
beast of burden, you bear the load of trying to seduce various women into
rendering your own service as seva-dasis. 


 


2) You
beg alms everywhere you go, proudly advertising yourself as belonging to the
disciplic lineage of the infallible Lord Krsna (acyuta-gotra) -- but in your
show of deep meditation yoou simply concentrate on repeatedly calculating the
total amount of your acquired rupees and milk. You are expert at begging on
behalf of your belly, and you make a hoax of giving spiritual instructions to
others, ultimately exhibiting the behavior of a businessman. You are a
voracious glutton, accustomed to consuming huge quantities of food. 


 


3)
Unto those of such nature, Cand Baul advises -- this is the noose about your
neck. Quiickly cast afar these offenses unto other souls. Worship the Lord in
the honest role of a householder, executing your proper occupational duty
according to your own ability, and thus purify yourself internally. 


 


4)
Giving up your desire for being honored as a sannyasi, just worship Krsna in a
humble state of mind. By performing your religious occupational duties according
to your own natural propensity, the seedlings of your vices will be destroyed.
Then you will attain Krsna, your unhappiness will go away, and you will become
very intelligent.
