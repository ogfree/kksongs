TRANSLATION


1)
O Lord Krsna, understanding that You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Your father and mother (Vasudeva and Devaki), embraced You. You knew how
greatly they loved You, and in order to increase that love, You delighted them
by speaking very sweetly.


 


2)
O Lord Krsna, Your father and mother became overjoyed when You embraced them.
Speaking affectionate words, they bathed Your head with flowing stream of
tears, as You sat up upon their laps.


 


3)
O Lord Krsna, all glories unto You. You delighted the fortunate Vasudeva and
Devaki and removed all their distress. You covered their knowledge of Your
position as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, so they could experience the
transcendental happiness of intimate love for You.
