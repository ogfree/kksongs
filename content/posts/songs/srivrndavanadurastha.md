TRANSLATION


1)
O Lord Krsna, You became attracted by the pure devotional love of the wives of
certain 
brahmanas
 who lived far away from 
Vrndavana
. O Lord, You were pleased by those trees who in
that birth as trees were so much engaged in welfare activities for the benefit
of others. Accompanied by the cowherd boys, 
You
 drank
the 
nectarean
 water of the 
Yamuna

river to Your full satisfaction.
