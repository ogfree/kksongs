WORD
FOR WORD TRANSLATION: 
Namo Namah
Tulasi Maharani


 


TRANSLATION



1)
O Tulasi Maharani! O Vrnda! O mother of devotion! O Narayani, I offer my
obeisances to you again and again. 


 


2)
By seeing you or even by touching you, all sins are destroyed. Your glories are
described in the Vedas and Puranas. 


 


3)
Your leaves and soft manjaris are entwined at the lotus feet of Narayana, the
Lord of Laksmi. O blessed mother Tulasi, you performed successful austerities
and have thus become the chief consort and queen of Sri salagrama-sila. 


 


4)
You gladden and shower your rain of mercy upon one who offers you some incense,
a ghee lamp, naivedya, and arati. The Lord does not care for even one of
fifty-six varieties of cooked food or thirty-six different curries offered
without tulasi leaves. 


 


5)
Lord Siva, Sukadeva Gosvami, Devarsi Narada, and all the jnanis and great
munis, headed by Lord Brahma, are circumambulating you. O mother! O Maharani,
Candrasekhara thus sings your glories. Please bestow upon him the gift of pure
devotion.
