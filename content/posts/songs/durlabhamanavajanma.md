TRANSLATION


1) The
human form of life is the rarest opportunity for attaining spiritual
perfection. But now I am lamenting, because I've somehow or other been born
with such an opportunity, and I wasted it by never worshiping Lord Krsna. Oh,
to whom shall I tell the tale of this misery?


 


2)
Having married and entered into the entanglements of materialistic family life,
I passed my time in vain. I never got any tangible gain or permanent benefit,
only trouble and botheration.


 


3)
What kind of world is this anyway? It seems to be just like a magic lantern
show that I saw at a carnival, wherein so many shadows and optical illusions
dance magically before my eyes. I feel great attachment and identification with
such a world, and thus day after day pass by fruitlessly, without any purpose
whatsoever.


 


4)
When this body drops dead on the ground then what will remain mine? At that
moment, all of my sons and dearest loved ones will not be able to give me any
happiness.


 


5) I
work hard just like an ass everyday and now I am wondering for whom am I
working so hard? I am still surrounded by so many illusions.


 


6) I
waste every day in useless, insignificant work, and I waste every night
controlled by sleep. And in every 24 hours I never for one second consider that
cruel death is sitting very close by my side.


 


7) I
live a very carefree life-style, sometimes eating a lot, or eating a little if
I feel like it, sometimes I see nice things around the town, or sometimes I do not
go out at all, sometimes I wear opulent clothing, or if I'm in the mood, I'll
wear something simple. I live so carefree that I never consider that one day I
will have to give up this body.


 


8) My
poor heart is plagued by constant anxieties about the maintenance and daily
turmoil created by my body, my house, my wife, my family members and my social
obligations. All these anxieties are pinching me and destroying all my
intelligence.


 


9)
Alas, alas! What a remorseful situation has arisen! I am absorbed in all this
trouble, but I never consider that all these things are temporary and subject
to perish very soon. After I'm dead and gone, where will all of my material
opulences remain?


 


10)
When my body will be thrown in the pit at the cremation grounds, it will simply
lie there motionlessly. Then many crows, vultures, ants, and worms will come
and playfully sport there.


 


11)
All the stray dogs and jackals will then become very much delighted, and in
great ecstasy they will make a festival ground out of my body and will have a
huge celebration and feast.


 


12)
Just see, this is the ultimate destination of this material body. And the most
amazing thing is that all of my material opulences, house, family and friends
have exactly the same destination.


 


13)
Therefore I ask of anyone who has any sharp intelligence: please give up all of
these temporary illusions presented by maya, and kindly search after the means
to get pure devotion to Lord Krsna, for this is the only really tangible
eternal truth.
