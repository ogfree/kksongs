TRANSLATION


Refrain:
Beautiful one, look! As the day comes to an end the eternally playful Lord who
wears a garland of forest flowers comes before us.


 


1)
The nectar of His smile extinguishes the burning anguish of the young 
gopis
' eyes. His splendid peacock feather crown moves in
the gentle breeze. He is playful and generous.


 


2)
His garland of blossomed lotuses is flooded with dust raised by the cows. His
complexion is splendid as a host of suddenly blossomed blue lotuses.


 


3)
He delights you with the sweet muse of His flute. His sidelong glances are
waves. His eternal form is handsome. He is charming. He stays with His friends.
