TRANSLATION


(Refrain) Splendidly
dressed by His mother, 
Vraja's
 young prince walks to
the pastures.


 


1) Numberless cows walk
before Him. Behind Him 
Vraja's
 boys cry, "
Hai
! 
Hai
!"


 


2) Like Him in age,
garments, manner, and every other way, hosts of boys surround Him. With 
Balarama
 at His left, Lord 
Krsna
,
splendid like a dark moon, walks. 


 


3) A peacock feather
splendidly rests in His crown. His jewel earrings swing to and fro. 


 


4) His forehead is like the
glistening moon. Walking on the path, how many melodies does He play on the
flute at His lips?


 


5) A yellow cloth is
gracefully wrapped about His waist. He slow walking defeats the graceful
elephant. 


 


6) His jewel anklets
jangle. 
Govinda
 
dasa
 says:
Lord 
Krsna
 is the most glorious of all who are
glorious.

This
is sung in Raga
