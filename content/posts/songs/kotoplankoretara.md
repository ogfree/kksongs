TRANSLATION


1) How
many Â“plansÂ” are being made to live Â“
fine.
Â” The
material nature, however, destroys them, again and again.


 


2) The
transcendental energy consists of three modes of material energy is LordÂ’s 
māyā
. O brothers! Please try to understand the definition
of Â“doing fine.Â” 


 


3) Nobody
is truly fine here in the material one, though people still claim that they are
Â“fine.Â” With this mood, the spirit souls trapped by 
māyā

cheats them all.


 


4) By
that cheating, they are forgetting that they are always engrossed in the
illusion. Even though 
māyā
 kicks the soul,
the spirit soul does not break its forgetfulness.
