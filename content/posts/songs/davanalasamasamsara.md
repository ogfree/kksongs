TRANSLATION


1) The
spiritual master is receiving benediction from the ocean of mercy. Just as a
cloud pours water on a forest fire to extinguish it, so the spiritual master
delivers the materially afflicted world by extinguishing the blazing fire of
material existence. I offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of
such a spiritual master, who is an ocean of auspicious qualities.


 


2)
Chanting the holy name, dancing in ecstasy, singing, and playing musical
instruments, the spiritual master is always gladdened by the sankirtana
movement of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Because he is relishing the mellows of
pure devotion within his mind, sometimes his hair stands on end, he feels
quivering in his body, and tears flow from his eyes like waves. I offer my
respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of such a spiritual master.


 


3) The
spiritual master is always engaged in the temple worship of Sri Sri Radha and
Krsna. He also engages his disciples in such worship. They dress the Deities in
beautiful clothes and ornaments, clean Their temple, and perform other similar
worship of the Lord. I offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of
such a spiritual master.


 


4) The
spiritual master is always offering Krsna four kinds of delicious food
[analyzed as that which is licked, chewed, drunk, and sucked]. When the
spiritual master sees that the devotees are satisfied by eating
bhagavat-prasada, he is satisfied. I offer my respectful obeisances unto the
lotus feet of such a spiritual master.


 


5) The
spiritual master is always eager to hear and chant about the unlimited conjugal
pastimes of Radhika and Madhava, and Their qualities, names, and forms. The
spiritual master aspires to relish these at every moment. I offer my respectful
obeisances unto the lotus feet of such a spiritual master.


 


6) The
spiritual master is very dear, because he is expert in assisting the gopis, who
at different times make different tasteful arrangements for the perfection of
Radha and Krsna's conjugal loving affairs within the groves of Vrndavana. I
offer my most humble obeisances unto the lotus feet of such a spiritual master.


 


7) The
spiritual master is to be honored as much as the Supreme Lord, because he is
the most confidential servitor of the Lord. This is acknowledged in all
revealed scriptures and followed by all authorities. Therefore I offer my
respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of such a spiritual master, who is a
bona fide representative of Sri Hari [Krsna].


 


8) By
the mercy of the spiritual master one receives the benediction of Krsna.
Without the grace of the spiritual master, one cannot make any advancement.
Therefore, O brothers, I should always remember and praise the spiritual
master. At least three times a day I should offer my respectful obeisances unto
the lotus feet of my spiritual master.


 


9)
One who, with great care and alteration, loudly recites this beautiful prayer
to the spiritual master during the Brahma-muhurta obtains direct service to
Krsna, the Lord of Vrndavana, at the time of his death.
