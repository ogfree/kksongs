TRANSLATION


1) Oh my dear Lord 
Hari
! I am most fickle-minded, completely bereft of proper
etiquette and extremely insignificant. I always radiate an intense effulgence
of jealousy and malice. I willingly perform sinful acts, I love to do harm to
my well-wishing benefactors, and I am unnecessarily puffed up with false
prestige. Ferociously vicious like a barbarian, I am vastly learned in the art
of deceiving others. I am always obsessed under the control of lusty motives,
which are my very breath of life.


 


2) Being such a sinful
rogue, I am completely submerged in this ocean of material tribulation as I
aimlessly wander here and there in the vast ocean of birth and death. How will
I ever be able to cross over this deep ocean of nescience and enter into the
eternal service of 
Your
 divine lotus feet??


 


3) Only if I get 
Your
 causeless mercy, then I can certainly cross over this
miserable ocean of suffering. Now, my dear Lord, 
Bhaktivinoda

is humbly requesting 
You
 to kindly keep this servant
as just one of the many particles of dust under the safe shelter of Your
beautiful lotus feet... then I'll be fully satisfied.
