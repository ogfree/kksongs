TRANSLATION


1)
1. 
He whose honey flute-muse maddens the mind of Sri 
Radhika
, 2.
 He whose heart is overwhelmed by the
fragrance of 
Radha
, 


 


2)
3. 
He whose charming pastimes are a hook to catch the fish of
beautiful 
Radha's
 heart, 4.
 He who becomes
attracted by the amorous devices of 
Radha
, who is
blinded by love and pride, 


 


3)
5. 
He who is controlled by the shadow of the jealous anger of
amorous, 
unsubmissive
 
Radha
,
6.
 He who is greedy to taste the sweet nectar of 
Radha's

crooked words, 


 


4)
7. 
He the moonlight of whose face brings great tidal waves to
the 
ocean
 of 
Radha
's
 love, 8.
 He who is handsome sapphire necklace decorating the
throat of the daughter of King 
Vrsabhanu
, 


 


5)
9. 
He who is a bumblebee at the dark, blossoming lotus flower
of 
Radha's
 mouth, and 10.
 
He
whose chest is splendidly decorated with the musk of 
Radha's

breasts.


 


6)
May he who reads these ten names, which are beautiful with the pastimes of the
prince of 
Vraja
, become very dear to Him.
