LYRICS:


(1)


aisī
lāgī lagan mīrā ho gayī magan


vo
to galī galī hari guṇa gāne lagī


mahalo
meń palī bana ke jogan calī


mīrā
rānī dīvānī kahāne lagī


 


(2)


koī
roke nahīń koī ṭoke nahīń


mīrā
govinda gopāla gāne lagī


baiṭhī
santoń ke sańga, rańgī mohana ke rańga


mīrā
premī prītama ko manāne lagī


 


(3)


rāṇā
ne viṣa diyā māno amṛta piyā


mīrā
sāgara meń saritā samāne lagī


duḥkha
lākhoń sahe, mukhse govinda kahe


mīrā
govinda gopāla gāne lagī


 


TRANSLATION


1)
Such is the attachment in which Mira Bai is drowned in her love for her beloved
Lord Krsna. She sings praises of Krsna down each and every street! She was
raised in the palaces but now, she is a maidservant and a devotee of Krsna.
Some has said that Â“Queen Mira has gone mad!Â”


 


2)
Nobody can stop her! Nobody can interrupt her! Mira Bai continues to sing the
names of Â“Govinda! Gopala!Â” She associates with devotees and get dyed red in
love of Krsna. She feels that she and her Lord have finally united!


 


3) The
king fed her poison, but she took it as nectar. She is like a river who has met
the ocean. Even though Mira Bai had felt thousands of sufferings and pains, all
she knew was chanting of Lord GovindaÂ’s name. All she that was, is, and will
always be chanting is the names of Â“GovindaÂ” and Â“Gopala.Â”
