TRANSLATION


1)
[Â“I offer my humble 
obeisances
 to 
Krsna
Â”]
Delighted by 
Garga
 
Muni's

eloquent words, 
Nanda
 Maharaja brought 
Krsna
 to a secluded place, where 
Garga


Muni
, performing the auspicious name-giving ceremony
for the Lord, enumerated the Lord's glories and 
opulences
.


 


2)
I offer respectful 
obeisances
 to 
Krsna
,
who is very affectionate to the devotees, protecting them, and destroying the demons.
He is the great Lord 
Narayana
 and He increases the
bliss of 
Nanda
 Maharaja.


 


3)
O 
Krsna
, eagerly crawling about on 
Your

hands and knees, and performing the pastimes of an innocent child, you enchant
the minds Â¨ of the devotees). 
All to You.


 


4)
O 
Krsna
, delighted by the sounds (of other people's)
ankle-bells, 
You
 would crawl in the mud of 
Vraja
 (as if to follow them). 
the

top of Your head was decorated with a jewel, and Your neck appeared very
splendid, ornamented with the nails of a tiger.


 


5)
O 
Krsna
, you appear very charming, anointed with the
mud of 
Vraja
, and Your and hips becoming gradually
stronger as 
You
 grew older. O Lord, You desired to see
the reflection of 
Your
 face and You saw that
reflection, You playfully imitated Your own movements.


 


6)
O 
Krsna
, holding You with her hands as she was
breast-feeding You, Mother 
Yasoda
 little teeth
beginning to grow in Your smiling mouth, which was speaking the charming
inarticulate words of a small child. At that time 
You

began to walk, Your amazing activities occasionally decorated with stumbling.


 


REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:


This song is based on 
Srimad


Bhagavatam
