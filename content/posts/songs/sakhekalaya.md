TRANSLATION


1)
My friend! That most magnanimous Sri 
Gauranga
 
Mahaprabhu
 has appeared as the rising sun to dispel the
darkness of this age Kali.


 


2)
His brilliant golden complexion shames the bright luster of gold, and His
beauty defeats the pride of Cupid. His curly black hair is decorated with a
garland made of 
malati
 flowers, and bumble bees fly
around them.


 


3)
His beautiful moonlike face is decorated with 
tilaka
,
and His dressing enchants the whole world. His sweet smile delivers all
embodied souls from the mire of material existence, by generating in them greed
for love of Godhead. He displays unique ecstatic symptoms.


 


4)
He Hankering to relish the unparalleled pastimes of the greatly munificent Sri 
Gaurasundara
, who distributes mercy in the form of 
nama-prema
 to the supremely fortunate 
niskincana

souls (those whose only possession is love of Krishna), the fallen and foolish 
Radha-mohana
 sings in a mood of great distress
