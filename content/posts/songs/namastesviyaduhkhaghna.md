TRANSLATION


1)
O 
Krsna
, You removed the grief the inhabitants of 
Vraja
 were feeling on 
Your
 account.
You expertly played with the 
Kaliya
 serpent, making
his hoods the arena for 
Your
 dancing, and crushing
those hoods as You danced. I offer respectful 
obeisances

unto 
You
.


 


2)
O 
Krsna
, accompanied by the songs and instrumental
music of the 
Gandharvas
, 
Siddhas

and other demigods, 
You
 danced on 
Kaliya's

hoods, Your beautiful lotus-feet reddened by the jewels decorating those hoods.


 


3)
O 
Krsna
, with the crushing steps of 
Your
 lotus feet You forced 
Kaliya
,
the king of snakes, to bow down his head. His body broken and vomiting blood,
that serpent, in that very wretched condition, began to understand 
Your
 transcendental position.
