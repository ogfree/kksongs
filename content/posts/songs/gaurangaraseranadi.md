TRANSLATION


1)
From Lord 
Gauranga
 does a great river of nectar flow.
The waves of that river are waves of ecstatic 
prema
.
That flooding river never stops flowing.


 


2)

Abhiram
 
Thakur
 and 
Saranga
 
Thakur
 are that riverÂ’s
two banks. 
Acyutananda
 is its whirlpool of ecstatic 
prema
.


 


3)
Sri 
Advaitachandra
 is that riverÂ’s current. 
Prabhu
 
Nityananda
 is both the
diver that swims in that river and the captain of the boat that plies its
waters.


 


4)

Srivas
 
Thakur
 and his
associates are the fish that swim in those waters of 
prema
.

Svarupa
 
Goswami
 and 
Rupa
 
Goswami
 are the sharks that
swim in that river.


 


5)
Alas, unable to swim in that river, the miserable 
Shekhar


Das
 stays on the bank and loudly weeps.
