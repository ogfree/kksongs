TRANSLATION


1)
I perpetually offer obeisances unto you, the lord of the thirty primal devas,
who are the original father of created beings, whose character is gracious,
upon whose head, which is crested by the sickle moon, the Ganga springs, and
who are a festival for the eyes of Gauri, the fair goddess.


 


2)
I offer my obeisances to you who resemble a moon of molten gold, who are
dressed in garments colored like a group of budding blue lotuses or lustrous
rain clouds, who bestow the most desirable boon to your devotees by your
delightful dancing, who offer shelter to those who seek to become one with the
transcendental effulgence of Godhead, and whose flag bears the image of the
bull.


 


3)
I offer my obeisances to you who dispel darkness with your three eyes - the
moon, the sun, and fire - and thus cause auspiciousness for all the living
entities of the universe, and whose potency easily defeats thousands of moons
and suns.


 


4)
I offer my obeisances to you, whose form is brilliantly illuminated by the
jewels of Ananta-deva, the king of snakes, who possess divine potencies and are
clothed in a tiger-skin, who stands in the midst of a thousand-petalled lotus,
and whose two arms are adorned by lustrous bangles.


 


5)
I offer my obeisances to you who bestow happiness to your servitors as you pour
upon them the liquid nectar flowing from your reddish lotus feet, upon which
charming anklebells ring. Obeisances unto you who are adorned by an abundance
of gems! Please endow Me today with pure love for Sri Hari.


 


6)
Â“O Sri Rama! O Govinda! O Mukunda! O Sauri! O Sri Krsna! O Narayana! O
Vasudeva!Â” I offer my obeisances unto you, Sri Siva, who are the monarch ruling
over all the bee-like devotees who are mad to drink the nectar of these and
other innumerable names of Hari, and who thus destroys all grief.


 


7)
I offer my respectful obeisances to you, Sri Siva, who are forever inquired of
confidentially by Sri Narada and other great sages, who very easily bestow
boons on them, who bestow the happiness of Hari-bhakti to those who seek boons
of you, who thereby create auspiciousness and are thus the guru of everyone.


 


8)
I offer my obeisances to you who are a festival of auspiciousness for the eyes
of Gauri, who are the lord of her life-energy, who bestow rasa and are expert
in forever singing songs with eagerness of the pastimes of Govinda.


 


9)
The person who hears these great eight prayers glorifying Lord Siva with loving
feelings and with great attention can quickly gain the love of Lord Sri Hari as
well as transcendental knowledge, the application of the knowledge, and unparalleled
endless opulences."
