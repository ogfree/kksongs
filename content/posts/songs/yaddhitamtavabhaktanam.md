TRANSLATION


1) One
who knows what is good for His devotees, who is as bright as thousands of suns
at the time of devastation - Lord Narasimha please bless those who are your
devotees with beneficial things.


 


2) One
who roars loudly, who has twisted and matted hair, who has deadly eye-brows,
who looks around cruelly, lion-faced Lord Narasimha, please destroy my enemies.


 


3) One
who has extended ears and a wide-open mouth, making enemies flee in fear, who
does not possess any faults - Lord Narasimha, please destroy all enemies.


 


4) One
who has pointed teeth, who has an effulgent chest like fire, who possesses
ferocious nails, who has a shining tongue, Lord Narasimha - kill my enemies.


 


5) One
who keeps the whole universe in His stomach, who has weapons in His hands, who
wears silk around His waist - Lord Narasimha please kill my enemies.


 


6) One
who killed the king of the demons, who has broad shoulders, who has killed
Hiranyakasipu on His lap - Lord Narasimha please destroy the forest of enemies.


 


7) One
who is praised and worshipped by Brahma, Vayu, Rudra, Indra etc who always
worship You solely, who has two strong legs - Lord Narasimha, please kill my
enemies.


 


8) One
who has creates fear in all enemies, who is specially ornamented, one who roars
'humkara' loudly - O Narasimha please kill, kill my enemies.


 


9) One
who sings this prayer to Lord Narasimha composed by Vadiraja Yati, by the
blessings of Narasimha, will find that all his enemies will be killed very
soon.
