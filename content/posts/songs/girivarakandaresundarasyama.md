TRANSLATION


(Refrain)
Entering a cave of 
Govardhana
 Hill, and a
pearl-necklace glistening around His neck, handsome dark 
Krsna

walks with peerless grace, grace that eclipses even the graceful wild elephant.


 


1)
In a jewel palace in the midst of a flowering 
kalpa-taru

tree forest, Lord 
Krsna
, the king of dancers who
charms every heart, yearns to enjoy 
rasa
 dance
pastimes.


 


2)
Expert in many arts and pastimes, He plays languid melodies on the flute.
Graceful like wild elephants, and their tight belts now loosened, the beautiful

gopis
 run to Him.


 


3)
He takes the hands of the beautiful 
gopis
. Bracelets
adorn His budding-twig wrists. The soles of His feet are red lotus flowers. The
black bees follow Him. He is the king of springtime. 
Govinda


dasa
 feels very fallen and lowly in His company.
