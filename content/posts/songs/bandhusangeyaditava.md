TRANSLATION


1) If you want to enjoy
laughing and joking with friends and family, if this is really your desire,
then listen to me. DonÂ’t 
go,
 donÂ’t go to 
Mathura
 (
Vrndavana
) to 
Kesi-ghata
.


 


2) There Sri 
Hari
 has taken the form of 
Govinda
,
who gives pleasure to all, whose crooked glance is quite captivating, whose
mouth is gently smiling, who is standing in His 
tribanga

pose, whose complexion is a very effulgent 
syama
 color,
and whose limbs are attractive like tender new leaves.


 


3) The sound of His 
vamsi
 enthroned upon His lips is the root cause of madness.
Brother, have no faith in that person who wears a crest of peacock feathers. If
you see that form, you will not be able to return home again. Your family life
will be destroyed. (This is my great fear!) There will be great danger if you
go there. If you want to enjoy family life, donÂ’t go to 
Mathura

near 
Kesi-ghata
.
