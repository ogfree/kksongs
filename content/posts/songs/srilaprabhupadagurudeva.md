TRANSLATION


Refrain:
I offer obeisances to the Lotus Feet of our spiritual master, Srila Prabhupada.


 


1)
While the world was drowning in the ocean of nescience, he has given the light
of devotion to Krsna with his hands that radiated throughout the entire universe.
In order to live happily, you have given us the name of Lord Krsna.


 


2) At
each corner of the world, the mahamantra has been heard. You have shown us the
path of Bhagavata-dharma, and held up the color of love for Krsna. Surrendering
to Lord Krsna is the greatest fruit of life. Lord Krsna is the source of all
pleasure.


 


3) In
many ways your glories can be stated until oneÂ’s breath stops. By your mercy
and kindness showered amongst us, our heads are always lowered to you.
Throughout all of life, we will remember what you have done.
