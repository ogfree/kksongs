TRANSLATION


Refrain: Oh Messenger!
Please tell 
Devaki
 my message. Â“Even though I was
merely a nurse to 
Your
 son, Your son kept calling me
mother.Â”


 


1) Â“Even though you know about
His habits, you still ask me about his habits. In the morning, my darling is
difficult to please and gets angry. He is pacified when offered 
capatis
 and butter.Â”


 


2) Â“When He sees hot water,
soap, and scented bathing oils, he gets scared and hides. Whatever He asks, I
only give in bribe so He can finally have a bath.Â”


 


3) 
Sura


Dasa
 says, Â“O Messenger, in night and day, I am
overwhelmed with fear. My curly haired enamoring is now hesitating to call me
Â‘Mother.Â’Â”

song was featured in the 1988 television series, Mahabharata by B.R. Chopra
