TRANSLATION


1)
Meditate on Sri Sri Radha-Krsna.Â  Don't desire anything else, even in your
dreams.Â  The treasure of love for the youthful Divine Couple is more valuable
than gold purified in ten thousand flames.


 


2)
As a fish without water suffers and dies, so a devotee perishes without love
for the Divine Couple.Â  As a cataka bird carefully follows the clouds, so a
devotee loves the Divine Couple.


 


3)
As a bumblebee yearns for lotus flowers, a cakora bird yearns for moonlight, a
chaste wife yearns for her husband, and a pauper yearns for money, a devotee
yearns to attain love for the Divine Couple.


 


4)
The happiness of the senses is full of poison.Â  Pride does not bring
happiness.Â  These things do not bring happiness.Â  They bring only pain.Â  Taste
the nectar of serving Lord Govinda.Â  Associate with His devotees.Â  Learn the
truth of loving devotional service.


 


5)
The treasure of divine love does not present itself before the demons that turn
their backs on Lord Govinda, become angry when they see the devotees, and think
the devotees are ordinary people.


 


6)
These unfortunate fools cannot understand the truth.Â  Proud, bewildered by false-ego,
and empty of devotion for the Lord, they are the poorest and most wretched
people in the world.Â  All their thoughts are empty and without meaning.


 


7)
O mind, renounce everything and desire only to love and serve the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Lord Hari. Lord Govinda, the best of them who taste
transcendental nectar, stays in King Nanda's house.Â  Desire Him alone.


 


8)
Narottama dasa says: Because I cannot attain the association of devotees, my
life is like a burning fire.Â  No one is unfortunate as I.Â  I am overcome by
material illusion, and great pain is beginning to waken in my heart.
