TRANSLATION


1) So, my dear mind, now
you want to become a yogi. You read the various scriptures which describe different
routines and techniques of sense control, breathing exercises and sitting
postures.


 


2) For attaining ultimate 
samadhi
 you undertake many difficult practices like
withdrawal of the senses, meditation and perseverance. Tell me, what wonderful
result will be there in exchange for such endeavor? Minimizing your bodily and
mental activities, and making the senses dull and dry, you live by holding the
breath in suspension. Thus you practice the yoga process while contemplating on
the soul's nature as Brahman.


 


3) You will get the
eighteen mystic perfections and, mistaking them to be the greatest object of
reality; you will entertain further wishes for still more wonderful 
opulences
. Abandoning the plane of gross matter and
entering into the subtle astral plane, you will simply undergo more troubles
and tribulations all over again.


 


4) The eternally pure
wealth of the spirit soul is simply to remain as the humble servant of Lord 
Hari
. In comparison to this eternal wealth, what kind of
spiritual result could possibly come from mundane so-called yoga practice? Just
take refuge totally in the yoga of devotional service and you will become
fearless, for then there is all likelihood of attaining you immortal nectar
very easily. 


 


5) 
Bhaktivinoda's

humble entreaty is that you just perform the blissful worship of 
Radha-Krsna
, my dear mind, and immediately reject all other
goals of so-called yoga practice.
