TRANSLATION


1) Please gaze, O, at 
Caitanya-avatara
. As He sings, the hairs of His body stand
erect. Overcome with ecstasy, He rolls on the ground. He is Lord 
Krsna
, the king of 
Vaikuntha
. To
this world descending in the form of a 
brahmana
, He
enjoys pastimes of 
sankirtana
.


Â 


2) His form is graceful and
glorious. His complexion defeats gold. His long arms reach to His knees.
Manifesting the form of a 
sannyasi
, He is overcome by
tasting the nectar of love for a person who is actually Himself. How does He
dance in such ecstasy? I do not know.


 


3) O Sri 
Gaurasundara
, O ocean of mercy, glory to You! O king of 
Vrndavana
, glory to You! O king of 
Navadvipa
,
please give the shade of Your lotus feet to this wicked 
Vrndavana


dasa
.
