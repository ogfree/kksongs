TRANSLATION


(Refrain) Lord 
Gauranga
 gracefully dances. He is an ocean of bliss. His
face is filled with sweetness. His smile is charming. He is like an autumn
moon. 


 


1) Lord 
Gaurangasundara

is the king of dancers. Is He ecstatic spiritual love personified? Is He like a
new monsoon cloud? Is He like a golden 
Kamadeva
? Is
He like nectar?


 


2) His restless eyes defeat
the restless 
khanjana
 birds. His arched eyebrows are
glorious. The soles of His feet are reddish. 
Yadunananda

yearns to attain His association.

song is to be sung in Raga
