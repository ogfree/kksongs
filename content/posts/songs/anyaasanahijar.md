TRANSLATION


1) Oh my dear Lord 
Hari
! He who spends his time under the shelter of 
Your
 lotus feet, oh Lord, becomes completely fearless.
Indeed, he has no ability to neglect 
Your
 lotus feet
for he hasn't a pinch of desire to remain under any other shelter.


 


2) A mother sometimes
neglects her breast-suckling children out of anger but still the children could
never give up their mother. This is because such small helpless children are
not able to maintain their lives at all without their mother, being totally
dependent on her.


 


3) Similarly, 
Bhaktivinoda
 says to 
You
, oh Lord
Who is overflowing with compassion, that You may reject me if You like, seeing
all of my offenses. But still, I will never be able to abandon 
You
, for I cannot maintain my life under any circumstances
without You.
