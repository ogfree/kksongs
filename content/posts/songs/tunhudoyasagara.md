TRANSLATION


1) O
Lord, You are an ocean of mercy. You have brought Your innumerable holy names to
this world and have taught the chanting of them to the fallen living beings
just for their deliverance.


 


2) You
invest all Your energies in Your own holy name, and for chanting Your holy name
You have not established any rules such as consideration of time or place.


 


3)
Your divine holy name, being non-different from You, is like touchstone. You
have distributed Your holy name throughout the entire creation, and that is the
essence of Your kindness.


 


4)
Such is Your mercy, which is supremely magnanimous, O Lord, but I am extremely
unfortunate.


 


5) My
attraction for the holy name has never come about; therefore the heart of
Bhaktivinoda is overwhelmed with sadness.
