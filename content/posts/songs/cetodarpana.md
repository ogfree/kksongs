WORD
FOR WORD TRANSLATION: 
Ceto
Darpana Marjanam


 


TRANSLATION


1) Glory to
the sri-krsna-sankirtana, which cleanses the heart of all the dust accumulated
for years and extinguishes the fire of conditional life, of repeated birth and
death. This sankirtana movement is the prime benediction for humanity at large
because it spreads the rays of the benediction moon. It is the life of all
transcendental knowledge. It increases the ocean of transcendental bliss, and
it enables us to fully taste the nectar for which we are always anxious. 


 


2) O
my Lord, Your holy name alone can render all benediction to living beings, and
thus You have hundreds and millions of names, like Krsna and Govinda. In these transcendental
names You have invested all Your transcendental energies. There are not even
hard and fast rules for chanting these names. O my Lord, out of kindness You
enable us to easily approach You by Your holy names, but I am so unfortunate
that I have no attraction for them. 


 


3) One
should chant the holy name of the Lord in a humble state of mind, thinking
oneself lower than the straw in the street; one should be more tolerant than a
tree, devoid of all sense of false prestige, and should be ready to offer all
respect to others. In such a state of mind one can chant the holy name of the
Lord constantly. 



4) O almighty Lord, I have no desire to accumulate wealth, nor do I desire
beautiful women nor do I want any number of followers. I only want Your causeless
devotional service, birth after birth. 



5) O son of Maharaja Nanda (Krsna), I am Your eternal servitor, yet somehow or
other I have fallen into the ocean of birth and death. Please pick me up from
this ocean of death and place me as one of the atoms at Your lotus feet. 



6) O my Lord, when will my eyes be decorated with tears of love flowing
constantly when I chant Your holy name? When will my voice choke up, and when
will the hairs of my body stand on end at the recitation of Your name? 



7) O Govinda! Feeling Your separations I am considering a moment to be like
twelve years or more. Tears are flowing from my eyes like torrents of rain, and
I am feeling all vacant in the world in Your absence. 



8) I know no one but Krsna as my Lord, and He shall remain so even if He
handles me roughly by His embrace or makes me brokenhearted by not being
present before me. He is completely free to do anything and everything, for He
is always my worshipful Lord, unconditionally


 


9) If
anyone recites or hears these eight verses of instruction by Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu, his ecstatic love and devotion for Krsna increase day by day.


 


Remarks/ Extra Information
: 


Lord
Caitanya Mahaprabhu instructed His disciples to write books on the science of
Krsna, a task which His followers have continued to carry out down to the
present day. The elaborations and expositions on the philosophy taught by Lord
Caitanya are, in fact, the most voluminous, exacting, and consistent, due to
the system of disciplic succession. Although Lord Caitanya was widely renowned
as a scholar in His youth, one of His famous doctrines he left behind was the
Siksastaka. These eight verses clearly reveal His mission and precepts. These
supremely valuable prayers are translated herein.


 


The
Caitanya Caritmarta had these prayers in here in Chapter 20 in the Antya Lila.
The verses are shown in the official name field of this page. The gaps between
verses are the purports by Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu.


 


Verses
1 through 8 are the actual Siksatakam verses (in Sanskrit). The final verse is
in Bengali.
