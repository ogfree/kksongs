TRANSLATION


1)
O Rama, Who set forth to kill Ravana! O Rama, Who was surrounded by the armies
of apeman! O Rama, Who was worshipped by the dried-up Varuna (the demigod presiding
the sea)! O Rama, Who gave assurance to protect Vibhisana!


 


2)
O Rama, who arranged for the bridge of rocks to be constructed! O Rama, Who
beheaded Kumbhakarna! O Rama, Who crushed the masses of the demoniac class! O Rama,
Who was taken away to underworld by Ahiravana and Mahiravana!


 


3) O Rama,
Who cut off the ten heads of Ravana! O Rama, Who was praised by the assembly
demigods led by Brahma and Siva! O Rama, Who was seen by Dasaratha from the
heavenly planets, upon His victory! O Rama, Who was delighted by the sight of Sita!


 


4) O Rama,
Who was glorified by the newly anointed Vibhisana! O Rama, Who climbed on to
the Puspaka aerial car! O Rama, Who honored Sage Bharadvaja! O Rama, Who is
dear as life to Bharata!


 


5) O Rama,
Who was the ornament of the city of Ayodhya! O Rama, Who was bowed upon by all
His people (subjects)! O Rama, Who sat on the throne resplendent with precious
stones! O Rama, Who was adorned by the royal anointment with a crown!


 


6) O Rama,
Who was respected by the families of kings! O Rama, Who was offered the red
color by Vibhisana! O Rama, Who conferred favors on the families of apemen! O Rama,
Who is the protector of all living beings! O Rama, Who is the savior of all
worlds!
