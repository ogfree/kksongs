TRANSLATION


1) When Sri 
Rupa
 
Gosvami
 renounced the world, 
Sanatana

was in prison. Greatly distressed, he thought within his mind:


 


2) Â“
Gaura
 
Hari
 has mercifully delivered Sri 
Rupa

but He has neglected this fallen one.


 


3) Â“I am bound hands and neck by the sinful
reactions of my previous karma, and this has locked me in this prison.


 


4) Â“With the rope of 
Your

mercy, please firmly tie up my hair and drag me to Your lotus feet.


 


5) Â“Behind me is a sea of unlimited depth, on both
sides is fire, and before me stands a hunter with his arrow aimed.


 


6) Â“In this way a she deer is entrapped in great
danger and is crying in grief, Â‘O Lord, please save me from this disaster.Â’


 


7) Â“You effortlessly liberated 
Jagai

and 
Madhai
 just as 
Vasudeva

liberated 
Ajamila
.


 


8) Â“At least with a shadow of 
Your

mercy give me the shelter of Your lotus feet, which are like a boat. The whole
world will glorify 
Your
 merciful deeds.


 


9) Â“Kindly lift me out of this deep ocean of
suffering. No one else can free me from this state.Â”


 


10) After receiving a confidential letter from his
brother, 
Rupa
 
Gosvami
, Sri 
Sanatana
 thought like this.


 


11) He felt pleased within his heart and began to
meditate on Lord 
Gauranga
.


 


12) This 
Radha
 
Vallabha
 
Dasa
 says, Â“After
reading 
Rupa's
 letter 
Sanatana

felt pleased within his heart, but he kept the letter as a secret.Â”
