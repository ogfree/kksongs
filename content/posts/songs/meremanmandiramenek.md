TRANSLATION


1) O 
Giridhari
!
I am begging 
You
 to enter, just once, into the temple
of my mind. O 
Giridhari
, O 
Banavari
,
You who reside in the groves of 
Vrindavan
 and attract
our minds towards 
You
. O beloved 
Giridhari
,
please come to me.


 


2) So many times have I
called out to 
You
 with eyes over-flowing with tears.
This most unhappy person is pleading before 
You
. So
please, O beloved 
Giridhari
, please come to me.


 


3) Simply waiting for 
You
 my eyes have become weary. Maya is attacking me at every
step. Just see my pitiable condition, O beloved 
Giridhari
,
and please come to me.


 


4) Please shower some of 
Your
 mercy here also. Being extremely thirsty, let me drink
just a drop of your love. I am nothing but a beggar, begging from you. O
beloved 
Giridhari
, please come to me.


 


5) I have brought 
You
 no gifts, my Lord, and have come empty-handed at Your
doorstep. I worship 
You
 with my love, so O beloved 
Giridhari
, please come to me.


 


6) You are free to love me
or reject me. You may call me near or 
You
 may send me
away. In any condition of life, I am a soul surrendered unto 
You
,
please, O beloved 
Giridhari
, please come to me.
