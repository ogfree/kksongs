TRANSLATION


1)
My dear mind, kindly cease from your endeavors to supply artificial
"pleasures" to the material body. This body does not belong to you
for enjoying as you please. Rather, it is the most formidable enemy of one who
is trying to practice devotional service in his 
siddha-deha
,
or spiritual body. But you, my dear mind, always depend on this body and try to
squeeze whatever pleasure you can right up to the limits of its physical
abilities. But what youÂ’re not understanding, dear friend, is that this
material body is insensitive and unconscious, and that it simply drops down on
the ground when your life is finished.


 


2)
The handsomeness of this body, as well as its strength and abilities, do not
last for very long. Therefore my earnest request to you is that you please accept
all these truths and don't become proud. The pure spirit soul in his 
siddha-deha
 is eternal and ever-fresh. But such a
transcendental soul meets his downfall when he becomes stupefied within the
cage of the material body. Thus his pure spiritual life is choked as he is
rendered insensitive due to enjoying the results of temporary 
fruitive
 activities within the shackles of karma.
