TRANSLATION


(Refrain) His arms long and graceful, Lord 
Caitanya


Raya
 dances. How many hundreds and hundreds of
devotional ecstasies does He feel? Who has the power to know? Lord 
Gaura
 
Raya
 is splendid like gold.


 


1) He sheds tears of ecstatic spiritual love. His limbs are glorious.
Splendid like sprouting blades of grass, the hairs of His body stand erect.
What more shall I say? When the people of the world see Him, they understand.
Their hearts yearn to attain His 
company
.


 


2) Hearing the chanting of His own glories and His own holy names, He
dances, overcome with ecstasy. Forgetting their pains and pleasures, the people
of 
Nadiya
 float in waves of ecstatic spiritual love.


 


3) He freely gives away the jewels of ecstatic spiritual love. He
showers a great monsoon of the nectar of ecstatic spiritual love. He showers
all the worlds. 
Caitanya
 
dasa

sings: He gives away the peerless gift of ecstatic spiritual love. Only I did
not receive that gift. Only I was cheated
