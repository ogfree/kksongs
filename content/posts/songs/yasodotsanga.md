TRANSLATION


1)
O 
Krsna
, while sitting on mother 
Yasoda's

lap 
You
 greatly amazed her by performing the pastimes
of becoming very heavy. (After she had put 
You
 down),
You were carried away by the demon 
Trnavarta
.


 


2)
O 
Krsna
, Your mother searched for 
You
,
and the demon 
Trnavarta
 became unable to carry You.
Grasping the demons throat, 
You
 caused him to fall to
the ground, lifeless and inactive.


 


3)
O 
Krsna
, in this way 
You

made the 
Trnavarta
 demon become as harmless and
insignificant as a blade of grass. The crying 
gopis

saw 
You
 and You were given to Your mother, the 
gopi
 
Yasoda
, who began to nurse
You. O Lord, O Giver of bliss to the inhabitants of 
Vraja
,
I offer respectful 
obeisances
 unto 
You
.
