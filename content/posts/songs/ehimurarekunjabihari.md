TRANSLATION


1) O
killer of the demon Mura, Who roams in the gardens! Come near. O Mādhava,
Who is the friend of those who bow upon, Who destroyed Madhu, Who is desirable,
Who is Keśava, and Who is the ocean of compassion! Come near!


 


2)
Hundreds of shiny bumble-bees are continuously buzzing in the gardens of [our] transcendental
mellows. O You, Who beyond the paths of material standards, Come near. We all
are craving for the sight of You, O Madhusūdana, Who is the quiet one!


 


3-4) O
You, Who holds a new lotus, Who is dark in complexion, Who is beautiful, Who is
decorated with Candrakusuma, Who rules the heart of group of Gopī, Who
held Govardhana, Who roams in V
ṛ
ndāvana, Who holds a
flute, Who is the supreme ruler, Who gives pleasure to Rādhā, Who
destroyed Kamsa, Who is complete! I am bowing into Your feet which is the
shelter of the unsheltered. O Janārdana, Who has yellow robes! Come close
to me in this garden.
