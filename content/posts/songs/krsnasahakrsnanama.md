TRASLATION


1)
Knowing 
Krsna
 and His name to be identical truth, one
embraces exclusively the holy name's path and thus who is initiated into
chanting the name properly should be mentally respected as a member of the
family.
Â  


 


2)
And he who serves 
Krsna
 by constant worship of the
name, within his heart ever residing at Sri 
Vrndavana


Dhama
, know him an intermediate devotee, make
obeisance at his feet and keep him as a faithful friend in your thought and deed.
Â  


 


3)
And who, by internal service to the name, knows his divine identity, sees 
Krsna
, only 
Krsna
 in every form
and entity, seeing nothing separate from 
Krsna
 in the
entire creation, he sees all souls equally serving 
Krsna's

predilection.


 


4)
Know such a veteran votary most honored and most cherished, serve him in
thought, word, and deed, with heart's fulfillment relished with obeisance,
inquiry, service, him in all respects entreat by the grace of such a great soul
we can reach Lord 
Krsna's
 feet."
