TRANSLATION


1) O Lord Krsna, You smiled and
jokingly asked the hunchbacked-girl Kubja to give the sandalwood paste (she was
carrying). Because her mind was captivated by You, she nicely decorated You
with that sandalwood ointment.


 


2)Â  O Lord Krsna, You became delighted
when Kubja anointed all Your limbs with sandalwood paste, and You took away her
triple-bent crookedness and made her into a beautiful straight girl.


 


3) O Lord Krsna, (attracted to You),
Kubja (amorously) pulled at Your garments, causing You to smile. You reassured
her and granted her a great benediction.
