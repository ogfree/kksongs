WORD
FOR WORD TRANSLATION: 
Ei Baro Karuna Koro


 


TRANSLATION



1) O
Vaisnava Goswami, please be merciful to me now. There is no one except you who
can purify the fallen souls. 


 


2)
Where does anyone find such a merciful personality by whose mere audience all
sins go far away? 


 


3)
After bathing in the waters of the sacred Ganges many times, one becomes
purified, but just by the sight of you, the fallen souls are purified. This is
your great power. 


 


4) The
holy name delivers one who has committed an offense to Lord Hari. But, if one
commits an offense to you, there is no means of deliverance. 


 


5)
Your heart is always the resting place of Lord Govinda. Lord Govinda says,
"The Vaisnavas are in My heart." 


 


6) I
desire the dust of your holy feet in every birth I may take. Please consider
Narottama yours, and be kind upon him.
