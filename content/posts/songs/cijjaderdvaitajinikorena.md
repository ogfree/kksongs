TRANSLATION


1)
Sometime one may foolishly try to establish the difference between spirit and matter
in a manner based only on materialistic speculative theorems; but alas! His
intelligence becomes covered over by a network of illusions, and thus he can
have no real illumination or realized knowledge.


 


2)
That person who understands that matter is simply an imitation model of the
true spiritual ideal achieves realization of the secret mysteries of the
absolute problem. And I would consider such a person to be truly competent.


 


3)
Therefore you can observe that this universe is simply a material imitation of
the supreme 
Vaikuntha
 realm. The difference is that
all of the existence in 
Vaikuntha
 is spotlessly pure,
without any trace of fault whatsoever, whereas the material sphere is always
full of faults and inebriates.


 


4)
In the abode of 
Vaikuntha
 the transcendental love
culminates into the highest limit of super-sweet 
mahabhava
.
In contrast, the insignificant imitative relationship between male and female
in this world, and the resultant so-called pleasure of their association
together, is simply an ocean of complete misery.


 


5)
Taking refuge in a transcendentally perfect 
siddha-deha
,
or spiritual body, on the strength of his union with his own natural 
samadhi
, the aspirant thus eternally worships in novel
curiosity the Son of 
Nanda
 Maharaja in the mood and
emotions like that of a female.
