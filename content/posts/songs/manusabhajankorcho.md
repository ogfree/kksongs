TRANSLATION


1)
O my dear brothers! You devotedly engage in the worship of the material bodies
of human beings, and yet you dare to sing songs about ecstatic spiritual
emotions (bhava). You expertly conceal your own secret activities, but all of
them will be fully exposed in Yamaraja's court. 


 


2)
Considering women to be hermaphrodites and men to be eunuchs makes one a member
of the Kartta-bhaja sect. On the pretext of this deviant thinking you engage in
mundane sense gratification, thus deluding even your own minds. 


 


3)
Although your mouths proclaim "the guru is reality," O brothers, you
revel in mundane sense pleasures. You freely associate with envious
non-devotees -- how then will you ever become 
puriffied
?



 


4)
The heart of the jiva becomes greatly agitated by absorption in the association
of materialistic women as well as greed for wealth -- does a true Baul become
attracted by the glitter of these worldly things? A cricket is attracted by a
flame and jumps straight into it, thereby meeting death. 


 


5)
Cand Baul very humbly suggests, "Giving up all these degrading things,
please chant the name of Hari in a purified manner. Then you will surely cross
beyond the ocean of material suffering."
