TRANSLATION


1)

Srivasa
 continued, Â“All of you together should
consider the real fate of the boy, and you should immediately discontinue any
bewilderment and grief that may be in your disturbed hearts."


 


2)
"The Supreme Lord of all the fourteen worlds is the youthful Son of 
Nanda
 Maharaja, and now He has become the Son of Mother 
Saci
 by personally descending in Nadia."


 


4)"This
very same 
Gokula-canda
 is now dancing in my courtyard
with His most confidential devotees, all completely overwhelmed with ecstatic
bliss."


 


4)
"My boy has given up his body while hearing the singing of the Lord's holy
names coming from the 
kirtana
 out in the courtyard.
Therefore he certainly has died while overwhelmed with love for the Lord."


 


5)
"If I would be so fortunate as to get such an auspicious death as this,
them I will certainly be able to easily cross over the ocean of material
existence."


 


6)
"All of you together just consider this one judgment ... what will your
lamentation and disturbed hearts do to help the situation?"


 


7)
"If you all do not become pacified by these instructions, then you will
only cheat yourselves out of tasting transcendentally ecstatic mellows in the
long run.


 


8)
"Not only will you cheat yourself, but you will induce me to leave this
world by plunging myself into the waters of 
Ganga
." Thus 
Bhaktivinoda

is witnessing this entire calamity in progress.
