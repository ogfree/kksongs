TRANSLATION


(Refrain) O 
Krsna
, You do not go to her and make her peaceful.
Separated from 
You
, a beautiful girl feels her heart
is now overcome. Now her heart is on the verge of death.


 


1) 
Now

that girl is covered with dust. She is not peaceful. She lies on the ground.
She removes her necklace. She unties her braids. Now her life's breath is
decorated with flames. 


 


2) Her garments are in
disarray. She has lost all restraint. A 
Yamuna
 of
tears flows from her eyes. Her beautiful eyes are like lotus whorls in the
lotus of her face.


 


3) She speaks not a word.
On the ground she has fallen unconscious. I do not think her life's breath is
still awake. An intelligent girl speaks some words to her. What will happen
now? 
Govinda
 
dasa
 is the
witness of all this.
