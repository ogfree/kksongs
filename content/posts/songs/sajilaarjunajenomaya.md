TRANSLATION


1) 
Arjuna

acted just like a conditioned soul bound by illusion. The 
Pandava

brother was bewildered as such.


 


2) Violence to his relatives and
then enjoyment of the kingdom. Could this truly lead to happiness? 
Arjuna
 showed lamentation, in this way. 


 


3) This though, was all identification
with the body, one who is a 
ksatriya
 gives up such
family affection on the battlefield.


 


4) Upon seeing 
Arjuna

bound by illusion, 
Krsna
 chastised him. Therefore, 
Arjuna
 accepted discipleship.
