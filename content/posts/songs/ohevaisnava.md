WORD
FOR WORD TRANSLATION: 
Ohe
Vaisnava Thakura


 


TRANSLATION



1)
O venerable Vaisnava, devotee of Krsna! O ocean of mercy, be merciful unto your
servant. Give me the shade of your lotus feet and purify me. I hold on to your
lotus feet. 


 


2)
Teach me to control my six passions; rectify my six faults, bestow upon me the
six qualities, and offer unto me the six kinds of holy association.* 


 


3)
I do not find the strength to carry on alone the sankirtana of the holy name of
Hari. Please bless me by giving me just one drop of faith with which to obtain
the great treasure of the holy name of Krsna. 


 


4)
Krsna is yours. You have the power to give Him to me. I am simply your servant
running behind you shouting, "Krsna! Krsna!" 


 


REMARKS/EXTRA
INFORMATION:


*The
six passions are those pertaining to words, the mind, anger, the tongue, the
stomach and the genitals. The six faults are overeating, attachment to material
things, inability to follow regulative principles, sense gratification, useless
idle talk, and impure habits. The six positive qualities are enthusiasm in
practicing devotional service, firm faith in devotional processes, a strong
desire to attain prema-bhakti, a favorable service attitude, avoidance of
non-devotees, and appreciation of the company of devotees. The six methods of
association are to go to an assembly of devotees, to invite devotees into one's
home, to discuss and hear devotional topics, to take the maha-prasada of
devotees and to offer maha-prasada to devotees. 


 


This
song can be sung in Raga Khamaja in Dadra Tala.
