TRANSLATION


(Refrain): In the world,
there are only two beautiful names, whether you chant 
Krsna

or 
Rama
. Sing the names of 
Rama

and 
Krsna
!


 


1) As 
Krsna
,
He stole butter from butter from 
Vraja
. As 
Rama
, He ate fruits and roots from trees. Both are won with

prema
 and 
bhava
, since they
are Love personified.


 


2) As 
Krsna
,
He poured love into the hearts of the 
gopis
. As 
Rama
, He destroyed the evil demons during His forest exile.
Both of the ocean of happiness, and both are complete Cupids. 


 


3) As 
Krsna
,
He killed the sinner 
Kamsa
, and as 
Rama
, He killed the rascal 
Ravana
.
Both names destroy distress of the fallen. They both are strength, personified.


 


4) As 
Krsna
,
He is eternally with Sri 
Radhika
. As 
Rama
, He is eternally with 
Sita-devi
.
They are the same Supreme Lord, whether you chant 
Sita-Rama

or 
Radhe-Syam
.
