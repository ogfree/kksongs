Jaya
Radha Madhava


 


TRANSLATION


1)
Krsna is the lover of Radha. He displays many amorous pastimes in the groves of
Vrndavana, He is the lover of the cowherd maidens of Vraja, and the holder of
the great hill named Govardhana.


 


2)
He is the beloved son of mother Yasoda, the delighter of the inhabitants of
Vraja, and He wanders in the forests along the banks of the River
Yamuna!       


 


Remarks/ Extra Information
: 


Srila
Prabhupada was very fond of this sort and sang it just before his lectures. In
Allahabad and Gorakhpur, Srila Prabhupada fell into a trance after singing the
first two lines, and after some time he came back into external consciousness
and said, "Now just chant Hare Krsna." Srila Prabhupada said that
this song is "a picture of Vrndavana. Everything is there--Srimati
Radharani, Vrndavana, Govardhana, Yasoda, and all the cowherd boys."


 


This
song is heard in Raga Kafi, Raga Misra Pilu, and Raga Darbari Kanhada.
