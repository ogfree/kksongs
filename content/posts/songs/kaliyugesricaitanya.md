TRANSLATION


1)
In Kali-
yuga
, Lord 
Caitanya

made the earth fortunate and glorious. He was the purifier of the fallen souls.
At that time He manifested a form effulgent like gold, a form effulgent like
Sri 
RadhaÂ’s
.


 


2.
(Refrain) Descending to this world, Lord 
Caitanya

purified the fallen souls. Seeing the snake of Kali-
yuga

(biting the fallen souls), Lord 
Caitanya
 was like 
Dhanvantari
 (demigod of medicine). Giving them the medicine
of Lord 
Krsna's
 holy names, He rescued the fallen
souls.


 


3)

Gadadhara
 and the other great devotees chanted Lord 
Gaura's
 glories. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, the
master of the all the worlds, the master who stays in the spiritual world of 
Goloka
, descended to this world. He chanted "
Hari
!" In ecstasy He rolled on the ground.


 


4)
Remembering the glories of His previous incarnation, He fell unconscious again
and again. At these times the earth became filled by bliss by His touch. The
touch of His lotus feet and lotus toenails made the whole world glorious. Only 
Govinda
 
dasa
 was cheated of 
Their
 touch.
