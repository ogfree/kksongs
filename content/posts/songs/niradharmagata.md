TRANSLATION


1)
Mud and foam are seen in the waters of the Ganges, for that is the inherent
nature of river water. Yet Ganges water never loses its transcendental nature.


 


2)
One may likewise find defects in the body of a Vaisnava, yet his body is always
spiritual, never material. That person who criticizes the body of a Vaisnava
falls into deadly irreligion.


 


3)
For such an offense, the fallen soul continuously suffers the tortures of Yamaraja,
lord of death. O youthful son of Nanda, I pray that I not be destroyed by
committing such an offense.


 


4)
The Vaisnava is Yours, and he is Your glory. May he be merciful to me. Then my
lifeÂ’s journey will lead to You, and I will obtain shelter in the shade of Your
lotus feet.
