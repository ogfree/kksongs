LYRICS


(1)


jo
tum toro rām maiń nāhiń torūń


tum
se tori kavana se jorūń


 


(2)


tīratha
barat na karau andesā


tumhare
caraṇa kamala ko bharosā


jāhāń
jāhāń jāvūń tumharī pūjā


tum
sā deva aur nahīń dūjā


 


(3)


maiń
apano mana hari sau joryo


hari
sau jor sabana se toryo

sab hī pahara tumharī āsā


mana
krama vacana kahai rāidāsā


 


TRANSLATION


1) If
You break our promise, Oh Rama, I wonÂ’t break it on my part. But, if I break my
part, who else can I give this promise to?


 


2) I
do not go on pilgrimages or perform rituals, because I do not know how to do
these activities. All I know is the trust of Your lotus feet. Wherever I go, I
will always worship You. You are my one and only Lord and no other lord exists.


 


3) I
take my mind and meditate and think of Hari in front everyone assembled. In my
mind, I tied the knot with Hari and broke any knots with everyone else. In
front of all, I put my full trust in You. Thus, Raidasa offers his mind,
thought, and words, to You.
