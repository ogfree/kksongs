WORD
FOR WORD TRANSLATION: 
Sri Guru
Carana Padma Kevala Bhakati Sadma


 


TRANSLATION



1)
The lotus feet of our spiritual master are the only way by which we can attain pure
devotional service. I bow to his lotus feet with great awe and reverence. By
his grace one can cross the ocean of material suffering and obtain the mercy of
Krsna. 


 


2)
My only wish is to have my consciousness purified by the words emanating from
his lotus mouth. Attachment to his lotus feet is the perfection that fulfills
all desires. 


 


3)
He opens my darkened eyes and fills my heart with transcendental knowledge. He
is my Lord birth after birth. From him ecstatic prema emanates; by him
ignorance is destroyed. The Vedic scriptures sing of his character.


 


4)
Our spiritual master is the ocean of mercy, the friend of the poor, and the
lord and master of the devotees. O Lokanatha Goswami! O master! Be merciful
unto me. Give me the shade of your lotus feet. Your fame is spread all over the
three worlds. 


 


5)
By making the dust of the Vaisnavas' feet the ornament of my body, ecstatic
love comes.  Washing the Vaisnavas' lotus feet is my method of
worship.  By always associating with the Vaisnavas, I shall overcome the
darkness of ignorance.


 


6)
O Srila Sanatana Gosvami and Srila Rupa Gosvami, who are two deep wells of the
nectar of pure love, two personifications of the splendid nectar of the Divine
Couple, and two desire trees by whose mercy the entire world is free from
suffering, all glories to you!


 


7)
In your books, you two great souls clearly described prema-bhakti.  You
are reservoirs of the sweet nectar of the Divine Couple.  Hearing about
you brings bliss to the heart. Their sweet mellows are my shelter.


 


8)
You are fabulously wealthy, possessing ecstatic love for the youthful Divine
Couple, a love more precious than gold purified in ten thousand flames.  O
Rupa and Sanatana Gosvami, all glories to you!  I beg you, please give me
in charity some of these jewel necklaces.


 


9)
I shall eternally engage in the nine-fold process of devotional service, which
is the essential message of Srimad-Bhagavatam, and I shall not worship the
demigods.  O brother, I say to you: Devotional service is the most exalted
kind of worship.


 


10)
Making the words of the guru, sadhus and sastras one with my heart, I
constantly float and swim in the ocean of pure love.  I am different from
the karmis and jnanis, who have no devotion for Krsna.  Narottama speaks
the truth.


 


Remarks/ Extra Information
: 


From
original research of the Prema-Bhakti Candrika, the original words were Â“
cittete koribo
aikya
Â” Translation
of that is, Â“I will make the teachings from the lotus mouth of the spiritual
master be one with my heart and I will not have any other desires.Â” Some renditions
will translate this as Â“
hṛdi
kori mahā sakya
.Â”


 


Verses
1 to 4 are celebrated in ISKCON temples as the Â“Guru Puja prayers.Â”


 


This
song is mostly rendered in Raga Misra Kafi in Kaherva tala.
