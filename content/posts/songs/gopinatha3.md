āmāra upāya nāi

tumi kṛpā kori', āmāre loile,

Gopinath!
Amar Upaya Nai


 


TRANSLATION



1) O
Gopinatha, I have no means of success, but if You take me, having bestowed your
mercy upon me, then I will obtain deliverance from this world. 


 


2) O
Gopinatha, I have fallen into the perils of material illusion. Wealth, wife,
and sons have surrounded me, and lust has wasted me away. 


 


3) O
Gopinatha, my mind is crazy and does not care for any authority. It is always
senseless and has remained in the dark pit of worldly affairs. 


 


4)
O Gopinatha, I have accepted my defeat. All of my various endeavors were
useless. Now You are the only hope. 


5) O
Gopinatha, how shall I make any advancement when my mind has come under the
control of the powerful senses and does not abandon its attachment to
materialism? 


 


6) O Gopinatha,
after sitting down in the core of my heart and subduing my mind, please wake me
to You. In this way the horrible dangers of this world will disappear. 


 


7) O
Gopinatha, You are Hrsikesa, the Lord of the senses. Seeing me so helpless,
please control these senses of mine and deliver me from this dark and perilous
worldly existence. 


 


8) O
Gopinatha, the noose of materialism has become fixed around my neck. Taking up
the sword of Your mercy and cutting this bondage, make this Bhaktivinoda Your
humble servant.
