TRANSLATION


1) Oh my Lord 
Hari
! You are the Father of the universe; 
You
 are the Mother of the universe, as well as the Lover and
son of all beings. You are the most dearly beloved friend of the heart, the
spiritual master of all, the ultimate refuge and the divine purpose-tree that
fulfills everyone's desires...


 


2) ...But my relationship
with 
You
 is simply that of Your insignificant menial
servant, Your humble attendant, always praying for Your shelter, surrendered at
Your divine lotus feet. I am simply 
Your
 plaything,
Your property, Your protected servant; my only identification is my personal
attachment to being Your devotee.


 


3) 
Bhaktivinoda

says that there is no relationship of "I and mine" other than this
true conception of being related to 
Krsna
 as His
eternal servant. Maintaining this position of eternal service, he thus accepts
the real principle of "I and mine" which is the natural, unchangeable
relationship with 
Krsna
 and all His devotees.
Anything besides that would just be material and temporary.
