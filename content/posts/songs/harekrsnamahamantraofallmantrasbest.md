LYRICS:


(1)


Hare
Krsna MahamantraÂ—of all mantras the best,


Throughout
the world is preached by saintsÂ’ potent grace behest;


Such
saints to the Name devoted, such pure souls great:


Never
dare offend themÂ—ever show them hate.


 


(2)


Lord
Krsna, son of Nanda, of all lords the LeaderÂ—


The great
Siva and all the gods serve His feet forever;


The
touchstone of the Name is Krsna incarnateÂ—


His
pastimes, nature, form, also think not separate.


 


(3)


Â“GuruÂ’s
a form of KrsnaÂ—the Scriptures corroborate;


In the
form of Guru, Krsna blesses the fortunate.Â”


Never
offend that Guru by thinking him mere mortal;


Gain
your highest objectiveÂ—serve the Name for time eternal.


 


(4)


The
Vedas with Mother Gayatra and Srimad-Bhagavatam 


Illuminate
the lotus feet of Sri HariÂ’s Name;


Whoever
vilifies those Holy Vedic ScripturesÂ—


Never
keep their company, know them as offenders.


 


(5)


The
glories of the NameÂ—all ScripturesÂ’ exaltation;


Dare
not think their praise to be exaggeration.


Agastya,
Ananta, Brahma, Siva, etc., ever


Sing
the glories of that Name with full-hearted fervor.


Who
can cross the ocean of the glories of that Name?


Whoever
says Â‘exaggerationÂ’ have their sin to blame.


 


(6)


The
Holy Names of KrsnaÂ—eternal wealth of Goloka:


Who
thinks those Names imaginary, mundaneÂ—heÂ’s offender.


 


(7)


All
Scriptures claim the Name all sin it can destroy,


But
those who spend their time in sin making it a ployÂ—


Such a
wicked attitude is that of an offender 


Deceived
by illusion, perpetually to suffer.


 


(8)


I
comparable Name of KrsnaÂ—the treasure of ecstasy:


Never
dare compare it with auspicious piety.


 


(9)


Those
whoÂ’re faithless tÂ’ward the NameÂ—deceived by Providence:


Giving
them the Holy Name surelyÂ’s an offence.


 


(10)


Despite
them hearing the infinite glories of KrsnaÂ’s Name,


Those whose
hearts donÂ’t melt in love are rascals of ill fame;


Only
pride and avarice their thoughts and deeds do yieldÂ—


The
Pure Name of Krsna to them is neÂ’er revealed.


 


(11)


Casting
off these ten offences, leaving no exception,


Those
pure souls who chant the Name in Holy Congregation


The
miracle of love for Krsna they will surely savor,


The
Name Divine Himself will shine within their hearts forever.
