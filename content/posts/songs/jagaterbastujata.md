TRANSLATION


1) Oh my dear Lord 
Hari
! All the things contained within this universe are by
nature conditioned and bound up by the limits of material time, place and
circumstances. But 
You
, dear Lord, are not subordinate
to any such limitation or even to scriptural injunctions. Indeed, all rules and
regulations are trembling in fear of Your Lordship.


 


2) It is naturally
impossible for any kind of law to be equal to, or surpass Your Lordship, for 
Your
 transcendental position naturally transgresses all
rules and regulations. You possess the 
Supremely

independent nature, and thus You reserve the right to conceal Yourself behind
the powerful curtain of 
maya
.


 


3) Despite this covering
screen of 
maya's
 illusions, my dear Lord, Your pure
unalloyed devotees have the power to see 
You
. Indeed,
wherever they turn their eyes, they see 
Your
 original
personal form there. However, this 
Bhaktivinoda
 is
very fallen and is completely bereft of unalloyed devotional worship. But he
has one hope... he has considered the dust of 
Your

devotees' feet to be the sole essence of his life.
