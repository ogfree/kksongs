TRANSLATION


(Refrain) He who is the
Deity of love, who is love personified, gazes at 
Her
.
Now all 
Her
 sufferings are ended. He personally serves

Her
.


 


1) Respectfully He
approaches. He embraces 
Radha
. He holds 
Her
 to His chest. With unblinking eyes He gazes at 
Her
 for a long time. With His lotus hands He rubs His eyes.


 


2) Even though 
She
 stays in the cooling moonlight, She perspires. With the
palms of His hand He wipes 
Her
 face. With a moistened
lotus-petal He gently 
gently
 fans 
Her
.
"Was there trouble on the path?
",
 He asks.


 


3) Holding 
Her
 chin with a finger, He places 
betelnuts

in Her mouth. 
Krsna
 speaks sweetly. 
Govinda
 
dasa
 says: 
Radha
 feels 
She
 is being bathed in
nectar that is eternally newer and newer.
