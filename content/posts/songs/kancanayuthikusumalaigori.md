TRANSLATION


1) O beautiful fair girl,
taking a golden 
yuthi
 flower, He carefully made a
Deity of You.


 


2) Filled with love for
You, He embraced that Deity, but the heat of His body turned that Deity into
ashes.


 


3) Listen. Listen, O
daughter of King 
Vrsabhanu
. 
Krsna

burns in many flames of separation from 
You
.


 


4) His body graceful like
blue lotus petals is overcome. His eyes now flooded with waves of tears, He
cannot see.


 


5) He threw His flute far
away. Moment after moment He drowns in the flames of 
Kamadeva's

fire.


 


6) He forgets His
peacock-feather crown. His friends gather around Him. Soon His life with be cut
and He will die.


 


7) Before Your feet 
Govinda
 
dasa
 says: The hope that
again He will enjoy nectar pastimes with 
You
 is all
that keeps Sri 
Krsna
 alive.
