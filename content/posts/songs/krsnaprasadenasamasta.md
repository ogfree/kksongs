TRANSLATION


1) May
Govardhana Hill, which by Krsna's mercy became the king of all mountains and
received the respectful tribute of its arch-enemy Indra, fulfill my desire.


Â 

2) As it was held above the earth it became so filled with happiness by
experiencing the softness of its beloved Krsna's lotus hand it did not even
know it was being struck by Indra's thunderbolt. May Govardhana Hill
fulfill my desire.


 


3) Trying to collect a toll, Krsna quarreled there with King Vrsabhanu's
daughter. The personified Vedas yearn to list to that quarrel. May Govardhana
his fulfill my desire.


 


4)
Bathing in a nearby lake, the elephant of a pleasant breeze, covered with
pollen of kadamba and other flowers, gracefully plays there. May Govardhana
Hill fulfill my desire.


 


5)
Does the sweet fragrance of Govardhana come from the musk deer who relax there?
From the Lord who plays there? Or is it Govardhana's own natural scent? May
Govardhana Hill fulfill my desire.


 


6)
Searching there for Lord Hari on the path of His flute music, the astonished
deer do not find Him. May Govardhana Hill fulfill my desire.


 


7) As
the Divine Couple traveled on the Ganges there the boat began to sink in the
middle. Krsna was splendidly handsome as Radha clung to His neck. May
Govardhana Hill fulfill my desire.


 


8)
Without taking shelter of the feet of the hill that is the best of Lord Hari's
servants and full of love for the divine king and queen, how is it possible to
attain pure devotional service? May Govardhana Hill fulfill my desire.


 


9) May
the reader of these eight verses glorifying Lord Hari's greatest servant, his
heart melting with pure love, quickly attain direct service to the lotus feet
of Sri Sri Radha-Madhava.
