LYRICS:


(1)


rāma jinakā nāma hai,
ayodhyā jinakā dhāma hai,


aise śrī raghunātha ko,
bārambāra praṇāma hai


 


(2)


kauśalyā jinakī
mātā hai, daśaratha jinake bābā hai,


aise kṛpā-nidhāna ko,
bārambāra praṇāma hai


 


(3)


viśvāmitra yajÃ±a rakhavāre,
gautama nāri ahalyā tāre,


aise karuṇā dhāma ko,
bārambāra praṇāma hai


 


(4)


rājā janaka ke tāpa
miṭāye, sītā byāhi ayodhyā lāye,


aise sītānātha ko,
bārambāra praṇāma hai


 


(5)


pitā vacana se vipina sidhāre,
sańga jānakī lakṣmaṇa pyāre,


śabarī ke priya rāma ko,
bārambāra praṇāma hai


 


(6)


dhanuśa bāṇa ke
dhāraṇa-hāre, rākṣasa māri kaṣṭa
saba tāre,


hanumān ke prāṇa ko,
bārambāra praṇāma hai


 


TRANSLATION


1)
He whose name is Rama, and whose abode is Ayodhya Â– unto such the Lord of the
Raghu Dynasty, I offer my most humble obeisances, again and again.


 


2)
He whose mother is Kausalya, and whose father is Dasaratha Â– unto such an abode
of mercy, I offer my most humble obeisances, again and again.


 


3)
Lord Ramacandra protected Sage VisvamitraÂ’s fire sacrifices from demons Subahu
and Marica, He redeemed Ahilya, Sage GautamaÂ’s wife, from his curse. Unto such
a merciful Lord, I offer my most humble obeisances, again and again.


 


4)
Lord Ramacandra relieved King Janaka from his humiliation and miseries by
marrying his daughter, Sita. He accepted Sita as His wife and came back to Ayodhya.
Unto the Lord of Sita Devi, I offer my most humble obeisances, again and again.


 


5)
To honor the promise of his father to live in the forest for fourteen years and
abdicate the throne, Lord Ramacandra went with His wife, Sita (Janaki), and His
dear brother, Laksmana. Unto the dear Lord of Sabari, Lord Ramacandra, I offer
my most humble obeisances, again and again.


 


6)
He is Lord Hari, Himself, adorned with a bow and arrows. He killed the demoniac
class of men (raksasas), thus redeeming them, and relieved suffering in the
word. To the life and soul of Hanuman, I offer my most humble obeisances, again
and again.
