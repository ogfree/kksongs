TRANSLATION


1-4)

When
 I saw 
Radha
 playing
with Her girlfriends, The path became lit, As if there appeared a garland of
moons. The ravishing beauty of 
Her
 shape, Is frolicking
with my eyes. Its sweetness constantly rouses within 
My

heart. I called to 
Her
, Â“O friend! O friend!Â” 
Rai
 stayed there, turning 
Her
 neck
to look at Me, She smiled. How remarkable the pure light emanated from 
Her
 radiant face, As a dangling pearl hung from Her nose!
The twisting and turning colorful tassels from 
Her

braid, That reach down to Her buttocks, Makes My mind and eyes restless. As
well as 
IÂ’ve
 never ever, beheld such beautiful curly
hair! Her enchanting form is painted on 
My
 mind. The
ten red moons of 
Her
 toes, And the sun of her red 
lac
-painted foot soles, Increases my desire for Her! 
Govinda
 
dasa
 says, Â“Let me serve
these lotus feet within my heart, as soon as 
She
 gives
me Her permission.Â”
