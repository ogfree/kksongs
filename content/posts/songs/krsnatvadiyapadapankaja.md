LYRICS:


kṛṣṇa
tvadīya-pada-pańkaja-paÃ±jarāntam

adyaiva me viśatu mānasa-rāja-haḿsaḥ

prāṇa-prayāṇa-samaye kapha-vāta-pittaiḥ

kaṇṭhāvarodhana-vidhau smaraṇaḿ kutas te


 


TRANSLATION


O
Krsna! Please allow my mind to immediately yield to Your lotus flowerlike feet,
just as the flamingo enters into the labyrinth of the lotus flowers' stems.
When at the moment of my last breath my throat becomes constricted by the
action of the bodily humors air, bile, and phlegm, how will I be able to
remember You?


 


REMARKS/EXTRA
INFORMATION:


Srila
Prabhupada sang this particular verse in his recordings. In fact, the RKC radio
in Italy uses this as the Â“commercialÂ” sound.Â  Mahatma Dasa sang this verse in
side one of his 1989 album Our Only Shelter. Therefore, this verse was posted
separately. It was sung in Raga Bhairavi or Katyayani in both versions.
