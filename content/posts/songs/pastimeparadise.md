Pastime
 Paradise! Pastime Paradise!


 


(1)


They've
been spending most their lives


Living
in a pastime paradise


They've
been wasting most their time


Glorifying
days long gone behind


They've
been wasting most their days


In
remembrance of ignorance oldest praise


Tell
me who of them will come to be


How
many of them are you and me


 


(2)


Dissipation
Race Relations


Consolation
Segregation


Dispensation
Isolation


Exploitation
Mutilation


Mutations
Miscreation


 


(3)


Confirmation......to
the evils of the world


They've
been spending most their lives


Living
in a future paradise


They've
been looking in their minds


For
the days that sorrow's gone from time


They
keep telling of the day


When
the Savior of love will come to stay


Tell
me who of them will come to be


How
many of them are you and me


Proclamation
of Race Relations Consolations


Integration
Verification of Revelations


Acclamation
World Salvation


Vibrations
Stimulation


 


(4)


Confirmation......to
the peace of the world


They've
been spending most their lives


Living
in a pastime paradise


They've
been spending most their lives


Living
in a future paradise


We've
been spending too much of our lives


Living
in a pastime paradise


Let's
start living our lives


Living
for the future paradise


Praise
to our lives


Living
for the future paradise


Shame
to anyone lives


Living
in a pastime paradise


 


REMARKS/EXTRA
INFORMATION:


In
Â“
Chant
and Be Happy
Â” where Mukunda Goswami and George Harrison
have a conversation about Harinama in Chapter 2, Harrison makes a reference to
Stevie WonderÂ’s Â“Pastime ParadiseÂ” and the chanting of Hare Krsna that takes
place. The RKC radio archives from Italy included this song in their song
database. This song was recorded and released in 1976.
