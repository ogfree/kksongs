WORD
FOR WORD TRANSLATION: 
Amar
Jivan


 


TRANSLATION


1) I am
an impious sinner and have caused others great anxiety and trouble.


 


2) I
have never hesitated to perform sinful act for my own enjoyment. Devoid of all
compassion, concerned only with my own selfish interests, I am remorseful
seeing others happy. I am a perpetual liar, and the misery of others is a
source of great pleasure for me.


 


3) The
material desires within the core of my heart are unlimited. I am wrathful,
devoted to false pride and arrogance, intoxicated by vanity, and bewildered by
worldly affairs. Envy and egotism are the ornaments I wear.


 


4)
Ruined by laziness and sleep, I resist all pious deeds; yet I am very active
and enthusiastic to perform wicked acts. For worldly fame and reputation I
engage in the practice of deceitfulness. Thus I am destroyed by my own greed
and am always lustful.


 


5) A
vile, wicked man such as this, rejected by godly people, is a constant
offender. I am such a person, devoid of all good works, forever inclined toward
evil, worn out and wasted by various miseries.


 


6) Now
in old age, deprived of all means of success, humbled and poor, Bhaktivinoda
submits his tale of grief at the feet of the Supreme Lord.
