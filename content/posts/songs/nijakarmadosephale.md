TRANSLATION


1)
Oh my dear Lord 
Hari
! By the bad fruits of my past
evil activities, I have slipped and fallen into the waters of the ocean of
nescience, and I have been thus bobbing and sinking beneath the waves for a
very, very long time. Swimming, I have not been able to reach the shore of this
ocean of material existence, for it extends for an unlimitedly vast distance.


 


2)
Becoming completely submerged and drowned in this ocean, I have loudly called
out with a greatly distressed voice for someone to come and rescue me. At that
time 
You
 came to me, oh Lord. Knowing that 
You
 are the safe shelter at the shore of this fearful ocean
has 
gien
 me a ray of hope.


 


3)
You, dear Lord, are actually made of compassion. I am completely convinced that

You
 are the original source of the highest form of
causeless mercy. Now this most fallen rascal 
Bhaktivinoda

won't reject 
You
 any more... for I, the befitting
object of causeless mercy, have attained the favor of He Who abounds in
causeless mercy.
