TRANSLATION 


1) One should make himself
aware that all the fundamental eternal truths concerning 
rasa
,

Vraja
, and 
Krsna's
 pastimes
are one and the same principle of 
lila-rasa
. And 
Krsna
 Himself is directly the personification of this 
rasa
. All things are completely under His control, as
confirmed throughout the Vedas and the 
Srimad
 
Bhagavatam
.


 


2) Sri 
Krsna

is the Supreme Truth, and all His pastimes are of the nature of transcendental
pure goodness. Maya is situated at a distance as His humble maidservant. Just
to show His causeless mercy to all the conditioned souls, the Lord manifests
His transcendental pastimes before their very eyes within the mundane world.
This just shows how much He desires their welfare.


 


3) 
Krsna

is Himself the only Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even Lord Brahma, Lord 
Anantadeva
 and Lord Siva are trying to find Him out again
and again, but still they are not able to understand Him fully. The vast 
Brahmana
 effulgence emanates from Him only, and the
all-cognizant 
Supersoul
 is only His tiny fractional
portion.


 


4) This Lord 
Krsna
 is full of all good qualities. He is most merciful,
He is the basic root of all truths, and all things in the material and
spiritual worlds rest in Him alone. He even manifests His own bodily effulgence
as the impersonal Brahman to have some impersonal pastimes. Thus He is just
like a gold-mine of unlimited 
lilas
. 


 


5) His 
lilas

are everywhere. Becoming His own partial plenary portion as the 
Supersoul
, He performs many 
lilas

by taking all the conditioned souls for a ride on the revolving wheel of 
fruitive
 action and reaction. Appearing in the higher
planetary system in incarnations such as 
Vamanadeva
,
He performs many more 
lilas
 along with the demigods.


 


6) In the spiritual sky on
the 
Vaikuntha
 planets, He becomes Lord 
Narayana
 and maintains hosts of servants there as the God
of all Gods and the King of all Kings. This selfsame Lord 
Krsna
,
the refuge and abode of all beings and all creations, in spite of such
incredible spiritual and material 
opulences
, likes
most of all to appear just like an ordinary human being in 
Vraja
,
and so He remains happy by expanding so many human-like 
lilas
.
