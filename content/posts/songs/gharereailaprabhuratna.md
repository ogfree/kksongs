TRANSLATION


1)
Lord 
Gaura
 returns home with many jewels. To mother 
Saci
 He happily gives the wealth He had brought.


 


2)
Lord 
Gaura
 bows down before her and gazes at her
face. He face drawn and withered, 
Saci
 speaks not a
word.


 


3)
Lord 
Gaura
 says, "Mother, why is your face so
drawn and withered? When I see your face so sad, 
My

heart bursts into flames.


 


4)
Hearing these words, 
Saci
 speaks some broken words in
a choked voice. Tears stream from her eyes and wet the cloth over her heart.


 


5)
She has no power to speak. Grief fills her throat. Finally she says, "My
daughter-in-law has gone to 
Vaikuntha
."


 


6)
Lord 
Gaura
 says, "Renounce your grief. O mother,
please hear 
My
 words. No one can destroy his destiny,
the destiny Lord Brahma writes on his forehead."


 


7)
Carefully listening to her son's words, 
Saci
 did not
lament. She did not lament in her heart.


 


8)

Locana
 
dasa
 says: Please
hear this pastime, the pastime of 
Laksmipriya's

ascent to 
Vaikuntha
. In this way I have sung of Lord 
Visvambhara's
 pastimes.
