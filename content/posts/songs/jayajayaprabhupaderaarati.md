TRANSLATION


1) All glories, all glories
to the 
arati
 ceremony of 
Srila


Bhaktisiddhanta
 
Sarasvati
 
Prabhupada
, which bestows eternal service at the Yoga-
pitha
 in 
Mayapura
 upon those who
observe it.


 


2) The enchanting fragrance
of the incense spreads everywhere, just like his preaching which astonishes all
liberated and conditioned devotees, as well as all moving and non-moving 
jivas
.


 


3) He lit up the entire
world with the lamp of the perfect conclusions of 
suddha-bhakti
.
This lamp is composed of five brilliantly glowing flames which represent
service in the five primary 
rasas
.


 


4) Those five radiant
lights destroy the darkness of ignorance and crooked intelligence throughout
the three worlds.


 


5) The water in the 
arati
 
conchshell
 is the
conception of 
Srila
 
Bhaktivinoda


Thakura
 which flows continuously and which cannot be
checked by anyone.


 


6) 
Krsna-kirtana
,
which is accompanied by 
karatalas
, bells, and other
instruments, resounds for all time in all directions, but really it is the
printing press, known as the 
brhat-mrdanga
, which
distributes the supreme 
rasa
. 


 


7) Resplendent 
tilaka
 adorns his broad forehead, and around his neck a
necklace of 
tulasi
 beads shines.


 


8) With his long arms
extending to his knees, his towering figure, and his complexion like molten
gold, he is supremely beautiful.


 


9) His charming, lovely
face displays a smile which is full of affection, and the beauty of his bodily
complexion is like a perpetually full moon.


 


10) Attired in daybreak-
coloured
 cloth which signifies the religious principles of 
sannyasa
, he nullified the misconceptions which were like
clouds covering the clear 
Gaudiya
 sky and established
the doctrine of pure 
bhakti
.


 


11) His many temples are
like luxuriant 
kunjas
 filled with aromatic 
bhakti
 flowers (his devotees). By their preaching they
spread the beauty and fragrance of these 
kunjas

throughout the entire universe to the delight of all.


 


12) As 
Narahari


Prabhu
, the ideal servant, fans 
Srila


Prabhupada
 with a 
camara
,
with great delight 
Kesava
 
dasa

sings this 
arati
 song.
