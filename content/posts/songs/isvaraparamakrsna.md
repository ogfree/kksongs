TRANSLATION


1)
Krsna who is known as Govinda is the Supreme Godhead. He has an eternal blissful
spiritual body. He is the origin of all. He has no other origin and He is the
prime cause of all causes.


 


2)
Enlightened by the recollection of that Gayatri, embodying the three Vedas,
Brahma became acquainted with the expanse of the ocean of truth. Then he
worshiped Sri Krishna, the essence of all Vedas, with this hymn.


 


3)
I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, the first progenitor who is tending the
cows, yielding all desire, in abodes built with spiritual gems, surrounded by
millions of purpose trees, always served with great reverence and affection by
hundreds of thousands of lakshmis or gopis.


 


4)
I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is adept in playing on His flute,
with blooming eyes like lotus petals with head decked with peacock's feather,
with the figure of beauty tinged with the hue of blue clouds, and His unique
loveliness charming millions of Cupids.


 


5)
I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, round whose neck is swinging a garland of
flowers beautified with the moon-locket, whose two hands are adorned with the
flute and jeweled ornaments, who always revels in pastimes of love, whose
graceful threefold-bending form of Syamasundara is eternally manifest.


 


6)
I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, whose transcendental form is full of
bliss, truth, substantiality and is thus full of the most dazzling splendor.
Each of the limbs of that transcendental figure possesses in Himself, the
full-fledged functions of all the organs, and eternally sees, maintains and
manifests the infinite universes, both spiritual and mundane.


 


7)
I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is inaccessible to the Vedas, but
obtainable by pure unalloyed devotion of the soul, who is without a second, who
is not subject to decay, is without a beginning, whose form is endless, who is
the beginning, and the eternal purusha; yet He is a person possessing the
beauty of blooming youth.


 


8)
I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, only the tip of the toe of whose lotus
feet is approached by the yogis who aspire after the transcendental and betake
themselves to pranayama by drilling the respiration; or by the jnanis who try
to find out the non-differentiated Brahman by the process of elimination of the
mundane, extending over thousands of millions of years.


 


9)
He is an undifferentiated entity as there is no distinction between potency and
the possessor thereof. In His work of creation of millions of worlds, His
potency remains inseparable. All the universes exist in Him and He is present
in His fullness in every one of the atoms that are scattered throughout the
universe, at one and the same time. Such is the primeval Lord whom I adore.


 


10)
I adore the same Govinda, the primeval Lord, in whose praise men, who are
imbued with devotion, sing the mantra-suktas told by the Vedas, by gaining
their appropriate beauty, greatness, thrones, conveyances and ornaments.


 


11)
I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, residing in His own realm, Goloka, with
Radha, resembling His own spiritual figure, the embodiment of the ecstatic potency
possessed of the sixty-four artistic activities, in the company of Her
confidantes [sakhis], embodiments of the extensions of Her bodily form,
permeated and vitalized by His ever-blissful spiritual rasa.


 


12)
I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is Syamasundara, Krishna Himself with
inconceivable innumerable attributes, whom the pure devotees see in their heart
of hearts with the eye of devotion tinged with the salve of love.


 


13)
I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who manifested Himself personally as
Krishna and the different avataras in the world in the forms of Rama, Nrisimha,
Vamana, etc., as His subjective portions.


 


14)
I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, whose effulgence is the source of the
nondifferentiated Brahman mentioned in the Upanishads, being differentiated
from the infinity of glories of the mundane universe appears as the
indivisible, infinite, limitless, truth.


 


15)
I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is the absolute substantive principle
being the ultimate entity in the form of the support of all existence whose
external potency embodies the threefold mundane qualities, viz., sattva, rajas,
and tamas and diffuses the Vedic knowledge regarding the mundane world.


 


16)
I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, whose glory ever triumphantly dominates
the mundane world by the activity of His own pastimes, being reflected in the
mind of recollecting souls as the transcendental entity of ever-blissful
cognitive rasa.


 


17)
Lowest of all is located Devi-dhama [mundane world], next above it is
Mahesa-dhama [abode of Mahesa]; above Mahesa-dhama is placed Hari-dhama [abode
of Hari] and above them all is located Krishna's own realm named Goloka. I
adore the primeval Lord Govinda, who has allotted their respective authorities
to the rulers of those graded realms.


 


18)
The external potency Maya who is of the nature of the shadow of the cit
potency, is worshiped by all people as Durga, the creating, preserving and
destroying agency of this mundane world. I adore the primeval Lord Govinda in
accordance with whose will Durga conducts herself.


 


19)
Just as milk is transformed into curd by the action of acids, but yet the
effect curd is neither same as, nor different from, its cause, viz., milk, so I
adore the primeval Lord Govinda of whom the state of Sambhu is a transformation
for the performance of the work of destruction.


 


20)
The light of one candle being communicated to other candles, although it burns
separately in them, is the same in its quality. I adore the primeval Lord
Govinda who exhibits Himself equally in the same mobile manner in His various
manifestations.


 


21)
I adore the primeval Lord Govinda who assuming His own great subjective form,
who bears the name of Sesha, replete with the all-accommodating potency, and
reposing in the Causal Ocean with the infinity of the world in the pores of His
hair, enjoys creative sleep [yoga-nidra].


 


22)
Brahma and other lords of the mundane worlds, appearing from the pores of hair
of Maha-Vishnu, remain alive as long as the duration of one exhalation of the
latter [Maha-Vishnu]. I adore the primeval Lord Govinda of whose subjective
personality Maha-Vishnu is the portion of portion.


 


23)
I adore the primeval Lord Govinda from whom the separated subjective portion
Brahma receives his power for the regulation of the mundane world, just as the
sun manifests some portion of his own light in all the effulgent gems that bear
the names of suryakanta, etc.


 


24)
I adore the primeval Lord Govinda, whose lotus feet are always held by Ganesa
upon the pair of tumuli protruding from his elephant head in order to obtain
power for his function of destroying all the obstacles on the path of progress
of the three worlds.


 


25)
The three worlds are composed of the nine elements, viz., fire, earth, ether,
water, air, direction, time, soul and mind. I adore the primeval Lord Govinda
from whom they originate, in whom they exist and into whom they enter at the
time of the universal cataclysm.


 


26)
The sun who is the king of all the planets, full of infinite effulgence, the
image of the good soul, is as the eye of this world. I adore the primeval Lord
Govinda in pursuance of whose order the sun performs his journey mounting the
wheel of time.


 


27)
I adore the primeval Lord Govinda, by whose conferred power are maintained the
manifested potencies, that are found to exist, of all virtues, all vices, the
Vedas, the penances and all jivas, from Brahma to the meanest insect.


 


28)
I adore the primeval Lord Govinda, who burns up to their roots all fruitive
activities of those who are imbued with devotion and impartially ordains for
each the due enjoyment of the fruits of one's activities, of all those who walk
in the path of work, in accordance with the chain of their previously performed
works, no less in the case of the tiny insect that bears the name of indragopa
than in that of Indra, king of the devas.


 


29)
I adore the primeval Lord Govinda, the meditators of whom, by meditating upon
Him under the sway of wrath, amorous passion, natural friendly love, fear,
parental affection, delusion, reverence and willing service, attain to bodily
forms befitting the nature of their contemplation.


 


30)
I worship that transcendental seat, known as Svetadvipa where as loving consorts
the Laksmis in their unalloyed spiritual essence practice the amorous service
of the Supreme Lord Krishna as their only lover; where every tree is a
transcendental purpose tree; where the soil is the purpose gem, all water is
nectar, every word is a song, every gait is a dance, the flute is the favorite
attendant, effulgence is full of transcendental bliss and the supreme spiritual
entities are all enjoyable and tasty, where numberless milk cows always emit
transcendental oceans of milk; where there is eternal existence of
transcendental time, who is ever present and without past or future and hence
is not subject to the quality of passing away even for the space of half a
moment. That realm is known as Goloka only to a very few self-realized souls in
this world.


 


31)
On hearing these hymns containing the essence of the truth, the Supreme Lord
Krishna said to Brahma, "Brahma, if you experience the inclination to
create offspring by being endowed with the real knowledge of the glory of
Godhead, listen, My beloved, from Me to this science set forth in the following
five slokas.


 


32)
When the pure spiritual experience is excited by means of cognition and service
[bhakti], superexcellent unalloyed devotion characterized by love for Godhead
is awakened towards Krishna, the beloved of all souls.


 


33)
The highest devotion is attained by slow degrees by the method of constant
endeavor for self-realization with the help of scriptural evidence, theistic
conduct and perseverance in practice.


 


34)
These preliminary practices of devotion [sadhana-bhakti] are conducive to the
realization of loving devotion. [Loving devotion] -- than whom there is no
superior well-being, who goes hand in hand with the attainment of the exclusive
state of supreme bliss and who can lead to Myself.


 


35)
Abandoning all meritorious performances serve Me with faith. The realization
will correspond to the nature of one's faith. The people of the world act
ceaselessly in pursuance of some ideal. By meditating on Me by means of those
deeds one will obtain devotion characterized by love in the shape of the
supreme service.


 


36)
"Listen, O Vidhi, I am the seed, i.e., the fundamental principle, of this
world of animate and inanimate objects. I am pradhana [the substance of matter],
I am prakriti [material cause] and I am purusa [efficient cause]. This fiery
energy that belongs specially to the Brahman, that inheres in you, has also
been conferred by Me. It is by bearing this fiery energy that you regulate this
phenomenal world of animate and inanimate objects."


 


REMARKS/EXTRA
INFORMATION:


Verses
1, and 3 to 7 (original verses 1, 29 to 35) are most popularly sung.


 


The
verses preceding Verse 2 (original verse 28, that is to say, original verses 2
through 27) were describing various facets of the LordÂ’s creation. Those verses
are not sung: thus, they were not included in this entry.


 


The
verses above are sung before an initiation ceremony of a new candidate for
spiritual initiation (diksa).


 


Lord
Brahma had spoken for Verses 3 to 30 (original verses 29 to 57).


 


The
verses 4 (original verse 30) and 6 (original verse 32) are sung in the morning
Srngara Arati. In ISKCON temples, this first track of the 1970 album Â“Radha
Krsna TempleÂ” is played. Srila Prabhupada enjoyed this track very much and was
very much moved that he said that this track will play at any ISKCON temple for
the Srngara Arati. As a result, no one ever leads kirtan for this song, as it
is played through that track. This song was rendered in Raga Kirvani.


 


This
chapter of the Brahma Samhita was discovered by Lord Caitanya during His
appearance. The other chapters have not been revealed yet.
