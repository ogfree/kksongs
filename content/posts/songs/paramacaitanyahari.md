TRANSLATION


1)
Lord 
Hari
 is the Supreme form of consciousness, and
His potency is the Mistress of the 
Vrndavana
 forest.
All the Vedas sing about 
Her
 being the transcendental
internal potency (
para-sakti
). To render service to
Him Who is the potential source of all potencies, 
She

expands Her internal potency into many bodily forms, with numerous different types
of potencies flowing out and spouting from the energetic source in all
directions simultaneously.


 


2)
Her internal potency is the abode and container of all potencies, and it
invokes the other divisions called 
sandhini
, 
samvit
, and 
hladini
. With its 
sandhini
 existence potency it transforms to produce all
things of substance within the spiritual and material worlds. With its 
samvit
 
cognizant
 potency it
produces all knowledge, which has a marginal sector called 
jiva-sakti
,
the multitude of conscious spirit souls. With its 
hladini

pleasure potency, the assembly of 
Radha's
 girlfriends
are produced and enlivened.


 


3)
The topmost divine wealth of the 
hladini
 pleasure
potency is the multitude of 
Her
 girlfriends, who are
all eternally perfect in spiritual bliss. And the original root cause and
primeval source of this 
hladini-sakti
 is none other
than 
Srimati
 
Radharani

Herself, Who is the embodiment of this supreme pleasure potency. Even the other
apparently opposing 
gopis
, headed by 
Candravali
 are all actually subordinate followers of this
transcendental Goddess Sri 
Radha
, for the fact is
that no one can possibly obstruct the gushing flow of 
Her

pure selfless divine love for Lord Krsna.


 


4)
The wonderful, unique movement of 
Their
 loving affairs
is such that 
Candravali
 appears to oppose and rival 
Radharani
, but this simulated competition is actually
chaste, for it is meant to nourish 
Radharani's
 pure
love for Krsna. Indeed, all the 
sakhis
 possess many
different bodies and many different moods, but their mind is factually one and
one only, for their sole, mutual interest is to give complete satisfaction and
total pleasure to the youthful Divine Couple of 
Vraja
.
