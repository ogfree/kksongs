TRANSLATION


Refrain:
Glory, glory to my Lord, Thakura Haridasa, who has manifested the greatness of
Harinam!


 


1) Amongst
all the devotees of Gaura, he is certainly the best. Upon singing his glories,
Caitanya Himself weeps.


 


2)
Advaita Acarya is the limit of prema for Mahaprabhu, and he knew the greatness
of Haridasa.


 


3) The
moonlike Nityananda is known as the life [of Haridasa], and the touch of
Haridasa's feet grants auspiciousness to the world!


 


4)
Hare Krsna, Hare Rama -- who more shall hear? As Haridas departed, life became
a burden to bear.


 


5)
Haridas was the crown-jewel of the Earth; In his absence, the Earth has lost
its gem.


 


6) Say
'Jaya Haridas' and make the hari-dhvani! So said Mahaprabhu and danced himself.


 


7)
Everyone sang, Â“Jaya Jaya, Jaya Haridasa,Â” who brought forth the glory of the
name!  


 


REMARKS/EXTRA
INFORMATION:


This is
to be sung in Raga Sri.
