TRANSLATION


1)
Whenever Radha is suffering in separation from Krsna and I am unable to give
any solace, my heart breaks for I am unable to tolerate seeing Her condition so
pitiful. Then I am fully prepared to give up my life for the sake of Their
happy reunion.


 


2) If
I were ever to give up the lotus feet of Sri Radhika, I would become totally
devastated in an instant. For Her sake, I am prepared to tolerate the pain and
the agony of death hundreds of times.


 


3)
When will I be able to serve such a divine pair of lotus feet as Radha's? Alas,
I beg you all, oh residents of Vraja, please be merciful to me now! When will
you take me in the transcendental forests of Vrndavana?


 


4) Oh
Vilasa Manjari! Oh Ananga Manjari! Oh Rupa Manjari! Please lift me up and bring
me close to your own lotus feet, thus bestowing upon me the quintessence of
eternal spiritual perfection!
