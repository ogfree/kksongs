TRANSLATION


1) I offer my humble 
obeisances
 to those lotus (kamala) feet of the lifter of 
Govardhan
 Hill, which are held by the lotus hands of
Kamala, 
Srimati
 
Radharani
.


 


2) The lotus feet of
Krishna are marked with a flag, a thunderbolt, a rod fro controlling an
elephant, and a lotus flower, and are embellished with 
kunkuma

from the breasts of the young girls of 
Vraja
.


 


3) His lotus feet are very
attractively decorated with ankle bells made of beautiful jewels, and are
dressed by beautiful girls who are stunned and afflicted by the beauty of those
lotus feet.


 


4) Because the glow of His
lotus feet has entered their minds, their minds seem reddish.
Â  
His lotus feet are so sweet that they have made
the bumblebees servants of 
Govinda
.


 


REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:


This
song is sung in Raga Sri.
