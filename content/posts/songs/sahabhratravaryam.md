TRANSLATION


1) Accompanied by
His noble brother, Krsna went to His guru's home. Now a 
brahmacari
,
He eagerly studied His own Vedic literatures.


 


2) He quickly went
to 
Avantipura
. He placed His transcendental form is
His guru's assembly.


 


3) Because He is the

Supersoul
 in everyone's heart, He dearly loves all
living entities.


 


4) He was very devoted
to His guru. Accompanied by the other disciples, He brought firewood for His
guru.


 


5) By His guru's
mercy, He became learned. When His vow had come to its conclusion, He performed
the 
abhiseka
 ceremony. 


 


6) When He quickly
approached to bring 
daksina
 for His guru, His guru
desired the return of his son as 
daksina
.


 


7) Learning that the
boy was swallowed by a conch, Krsna searched for him inside the conch. Aware
that the boy must certainly have died long ago, Krsna did not stop searching
for him.


 


8) Accompanied by
His elder brother, 
Balarama
, 
Krsna

went to 
yamaraja's
 abode and then suddenly sounded
the 
conchshell
, which was named 
Pancajanya
.



 


9) Quickly coming,
and greeting the Lord with all respect, 
Yamaraja
 was
filled with happiness.


 


10) Lord Krsna, who
stops the sufferings of the residents of hell, shone like a splendid moon, the
master of the stars.


 


11) Freeing him from
death, and giving him a new, youthful body, the Lord took the boy with Him.


 


12) When Lord Krsna
returned their son, the guru and his wife became filled with happiness.


 


13) Krsna has
returned to 
Vraja
. Gaze at His happily smiling face.
