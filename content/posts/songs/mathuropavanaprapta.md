TRANSLATION


1) O Lord Krsna, arriving at the gardens near the entrance to
Mathura city, You were surrounded by Nanda Maharaja and Your other friends and
relatives (who had arrived there before You). Akrura, who had already caused so
much suffering to the residents of Vraja, then invited You to visit his house.


 


2) O Lord Krsna, You were pleased to see the nicely decorated
and wonderful city of Mathura. The sight of You enchanted the eyes and minds of
all the women in that city. O Lord, I offer respectful obeisances unto You.


 


3) O Lord Krsna, that city was nicely decorated with yogurt and
other auspicious substances meant for the worship of the brahmanas. The women
of the city glorified the gopi's piety with great delight.


 


REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:
