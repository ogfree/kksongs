TRANSLATION


1)
If 
Rupa
 
Gosvami
 had not
appeared in Kali-
yuga
, who would have opened the
great store-house of 
vraja-prema
 and distributed its
contents freely?


 


2)
Just as a swan separates milk from water, who could have separated the 
rasas
 to taste them? Abandoning everything, he performed 
bhajana
 in 
Vrndavana
 and wrote
his 
rasika
 literatures.


 


3)
When the yellow forest flowers blossom and fruits ripen, he lived like a bee
taking the nectar from lotuses Â– who could have understood the nectar he was
collecting?


 


4)
Who could have understood 
KrsnaÂ’s
 
lilas
 in 
Mathura
 and 
Vrndavana
? How could we have known the sweet 
vraja-lilas
 and the love between 
Radha-Madhava
?


 


5)
By the mercy of his lotus feet, all can sing about and attain such divine
bliss. The surrendered 
Madhava
 
dasa

is always praying to embrace 
RupaÂ’s
 glories.
