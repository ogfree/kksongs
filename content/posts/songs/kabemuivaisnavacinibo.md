TRANSLATION


1) Oh my Lord 
Hari
, when will I ever be able to realize who is actually a
real 
Vaisnava
, the lotus feet of whom are like a mine
of all-auspiciousness? When will I become madly overwhelmed by holding such
lotus feet within the core of my heart?


 


2) Such a revered devotee
is always transcendental, free from all faults, and fully joyful in spiritual
bliss. Being lovingly attached to the holy name of the Lord, and always
disinterested and callous towards worldly interests, he is always melted with
compassion for all souls.


 


3) Devoid of any trace of
false ego, fully experienced and expert in 
bhajana
,
the pure devotee is completely detached from all types of sense objects. He is
always straightforward and sincere both internally and externally, and he is
completely attracted to relishing the eternal pastimes of the Lord.


 


4) I discriminate between
the three types of 
Vaisnavas
, namely the 
kanistha
 (beginning neophyte), the 
madhyama

(middle class), and the 
uttama
 (highest pure
devotee). I respect the 
kanistha
, I offer my
respectful 
obeisances
 unto the 
madhyama
,
and I fully submit myself to hearing from the 
uttama
.


 


5) At that time, when I
learn to properly honor such a pure devotee, recognizing his real quality, then
only 
i
 will certainly achieve all spiritual
perfection by his mercy.


 


6) 
Bhaktivinoda

always keeps a vow to abstain from speaking any type of envious blasphemy unto
such a pure devotee, whose life and characteristics are in all ways pure.
