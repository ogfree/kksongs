TRANSLATION


(Refrain) With thousands and
thousands of forked tongues moving in thousands of thousands of mouths, Lord 
Ananta-Nityananda
 chants the glories of Lord 
Gauracandra
. Goddess 
Maha-Laksmi

places Lord 
Visnu-Gauracandra's
 feet on her chest.


 


1) O devotees of Lord 
Gaura
 and Lord 
Govinda
, O 
rasikas
, please hear of the Supreme Lord who is Lord 
Visnu
 and Lord 
Maha-Visnu
. His
toenails are the abode of the Brahman effulgence. He is the life's breath of
the sages and demigods.


 


2) Externally His
complexion is fair. In His heart His complexion is different. His external
complexion glistens with the color of Sri 
Radha's

limbs. He enjoys pastimes on a thousand-petal lotus, a lotus with four gates. 


 


3) His abodes are 
Goloka
, 
Vaikuntha
, and 
Svetadvipa
. Any single one of His names is a 
shoreless
 ocean of bliss. He is 
Vasudeva
,

Sankarsana
, 
Pradyumna
, and 
Aniruddha
, who have abodes in the four directions.


 


4) Reclining on the lap of
a snake king floating on the ocean of milk, He enjoys pastimes of mystic sleep.
That snake king is the origin of all 
avataras
. He is
the master of 
Svetadvipa
. He is Lord 
Ananta-Nityananda
.


 


5) On each of Lord 
Ananta-Nityananda's
 thousands of hoods rests a jewel crown.
His white body glistens with many colors. How many associates 
has
 Lord 
Visnu-Gauracandra
? 
Sanaka
-kumara, 
Sanat
-kumara, and
a host of sages and demigods joyfully glorify Him with prayers.


 


6) How many Brahmas are
born from each one of His body's pores? Each Brahma begets a great variety of
creatures. 
Ramacandra
 and the other 
avataras
 are all His plenary parts. They are the rulers of
the universes.


 


7) In this way Lord 
Visnu-Gauracandra
 enjoys pastimes without end. How many
worlds of 
maya
 does He create? His eyes are quivers
filled with sidelong-glance arrows aimed at Sri 
Radha
.
Above the material world is His spiritual abode, which bears the name Sri 
Vrndavana
. Thus the devotee who bears the name 
Vrndavana
 
dasa
 sings His glories.

song is in Raga
