TRANSLATION


Refrain: Who are you describing to us? Listen, O 
Udhau
, we donÂ’t understand you. This is why we are asking
you to explain. 


 


1) Who became the king of 
Mathura
?
Who 
slayed
 the evil king 
Kamsa
?
Who is the son of 
Vasudeva
? Here belongs our most
charming one as we live by only looking at His face.


 


2) Every day, he strolls out grazing the cattle
taking the cowherd boys with Him. In the evening time, when the day is almost
over, he comes home and our eyes are stilled as we behold Him.


 


3) Who is this Omnipresent, All-Pervading, Eternal,
and Undefeatable One? Who is described endlessly by Lord Brahma in the Vedic
literatures? 
Sura
 
Dasa
 is
saying to all, Â“In vain, you are saying such senseless things, because for here
in 
Braja
, He is the dear of 
Nanda

Maharaja.Â”
