TRANSLATION


1) O Lord 
Krsna
, the 
gopis
 greatly relished
seeing 
You
 with their eyes. O Lord, You are very
expert at speaking eloquent words to cheat the 
gopis
,
and in this way 
You
 sweetly spoke them and tried to
make them afraid of not performing their religious duties of being faithful to
their husbands


 


2) O Lord 
Krsna
, by speaking in this way, you caused to the 
gopis
 to suffer greatly and cry. The 
gopis

earnestly desired the touch of 
Your
 body, and when
they plaintively appealed to You, You became greatly satisfied with them.


 


3) O Lord 
Krsna
, abandoning 
Your
 pretence,
Your attitude of mind became completely altered. Your face decorated with a
smile, 
You
 became infatuated with transcendental lust
(to enjoy the 
gopis
). O Lord, You are to be
considered the greatest of all rascals. Please protect me.


 


4) O Lord 
Krsna
, You then manifested 
Your

actual sweet and charming nature and Your eyes restlessly moved here and there,
impelled with conjugal desires. O monarch of hundreds of 
gopis
,
the glances from the corners of 
Your
 eyes enchanted
the 
gopi's
 minds.


 


5) O Lord 
Krsna
, staying at the shore of the 
Yamuna

River, and decorated with a 
vaijayanti
 garland, 
Your
 face is as beautiful as the autumn moon. O
transcendental Enjoyer of the 
gopis
, please 
protect
 me.


 


6) O Lord 
Krsna
, O defeater of cupid, when You understood how the 
gopis
 were becoming falsely proud, You decided to curb their
pride, and thus You playfully 
dessappeared
 from their
view, in order to show great mercy to them.
