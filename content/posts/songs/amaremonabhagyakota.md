TRANSLATION


1)
After how may days will my good fortune dawn when a 
Vaisnava

will consider me to be his very own property?


 


2)
By drinking the honey-wine ambrosia that has washed the lotus feet of my Divine
spiritual master, I will become madly intoxicated and will sing wildly about
the glorious qualities of Lord 
Krsna
 in 
Vrndavana
.


 


3)
I will abandon the company of all 
fruitive
 actors,
speculators, those who are envious of 
Krsna
, as well
as those who have turned away from the Lord, despising them as being
insignificant.


 


4)
The 
smarta
 
brahmanas
 who
are simply after dull, materialistic 
fruitive
 results
will conclude that I am a very agitated person and bereft of any proper
behavior.


 


5)
Such puffed-up scholars, who are actually 
impersonalist

speculators, will then renounce my association, considering me to be completely
mad.


 


6)
Seeing me thus bereft of all bad association, the most virtuous true devotee of
the Lord will then show his kindness to me by embracing me in great affection.


 


7)
Thus touching the body of the devotee this most wicked and rejected person will
joyfully experience all the eight transcendental ecstatic 
sattvika

transformations.
