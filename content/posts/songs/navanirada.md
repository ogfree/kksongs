TRANSLATION 


1)
He Whose complexion conquers that of a fresh new raincloud Who is the best King
of Paramours, the ocean of ecstatic mellows Whose crown is adorned with a
lovely peacock feather And is auspiciously tilted to one side Just worship
Krishna, the Dark Jewel, the son of the King of Vraja.


 


2)
He Whose broadly bending eyebrows appear like arched rainbows, Whose pure
moonlike face belittles millions of ordinary moons Who is endowed with sweet
gentle smiles and pleasant speech Just worship Krishna, the Dark Jewel, the son
of the King of Vraja.


 


3)
He Whose divine bodily limbs tremble profusely with CupidÂ’s agitations, Who
dresses enchantingly just to fascinate the Vraja vasis Who is decorated with extraordinary
eyes like blue lotus blossoms Just worship Krishna, the Dark Jewel, the son of
the King of Vraja.


 


4)
He Whose forehead is surrounded by a fringe of wavy locks Whose earlobes are
embellished with swaying shark shaped earrings Who is adorned with yellow silk
embracing His charming hips Just worship Krishna, the Dark Jewel, the son of
the King of Vraja.


 


5)
He Whose beautiful feet resound with softly tinkling ankle bells that madden
all the bees with their vibration of swinging gemstones Whose soles are marked
with the flag, thunderbolt, fish and more Just worship Krishna the Dark Jewel,
the son of the King of Vraja.


 


6)
He Whose graceful form is smeared with profuse sandalwood paste, Whose body
glows with the Kaustubha gem, eclipsing the sun Whose personal beauty
represents the topmost zenith of Vraja youths, Just worship Krishna the Dark
Jewel, the son of the King of Vraja.


 


7)
He Who is Mukunda and Hari, worshipable for all the demigods and sages, Who is the
guru of all created beings, the crest jewel of all Lords Who is known as 
Giridhari and Murari, more exalted even than Lord Siva, Just worship Krishna,
the Dark Jewel, the son of the King of Vraja.


 


8)
He Who is most fond of sporting with the Daughter of Vrsabhanu Who dresses
impeccably as the Crown Prince of Mellow Relishers, Who is the most
praiseworthy Lord of Lords in the entire universe, Just worship Krishna, the
Dark Jewel, the son of the King of Vraja.
