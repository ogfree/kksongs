LYRICS


(1)


bhāi-re!

śarīra abidyā-jāl, joḍendriya tāhe kāl,

jīve phele viṣaya-sāgore

tā'ra madhye jihwā ati, lobhamoy sudurmati,

tā'ke jetā kaṭhina saḿsāre


 


(2)


kṛṣṇa
boro doyāmoy, koribāre jihwā jay,

swa-prasād-anna dilo bhāi

sei annāmṛta pāo,
rādhā-kṛṣṇa-guṇa gāo,

preme ḍāko caitanya-nitāi


 


TRANSLATION


1)
O brothers! This material body is a network of ignorance, and the senses are
one's deadly enemies, for they throw the soul into the ocean of material sense
enjoyment. Among the senses, the tongue is the most voracious and verily
wicked; it is very difficult to conquer the tongue in this world.


 


2)
O brothers, Lord Krsna is very merciful. Just to control the tongue, He has
given us the remnants of His own food! Now, please eat these nectarean grains
while singing the glories of Their Lordships Sri Sri Radha and Krsna, and in
love call out "Caitanya! Nitai!"


 


Remarks/ Extra Information
: 


ISKCON
devotees sing this set of prayers before eating prasadam, in conjunction of the
verse (
Maha
Prasade Govinde
).
