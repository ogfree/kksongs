TRANSLATION


1)
The activities and behavior of Lord 
Gaurasundara

within the villages around Nadia District are just like sweet ambrosial nectar.
By drinking this nectar, just give up all of your material lamentations and
fears, and make your heart become thus fixed up.


 


2)
Within this temporary material world, my friends, the only substantial essence
of Absolute truth is Lord 
Krsna
. Therefore, kindly
take heed of Lord 
Caitanya's
 advice, and just worship

Krsna
 constantly.


 


3)
Whoever understands this and thereby firmly grabs hold of Lord 
Caitanya's
 lotus feet is most fortunate. And if he worships
Sri 
Sri
 
Radha-Krsna
 in 
Vrndavana
, then I will accept him as my very life soul.


 


4)
Their Lordships Sri 
Sri
 
Radha-Krsna

are none other than the selfsame Lord 
Gauracandra
,
and Sri 
Navadvipa-dhama
 is that very same 
Vrndavana-dhama
. If you consider this as the only essential
point, then you will rightfully receive some eternal treasures.


 


5)
Actually I am completely devoid of any real knowledge or good intelligence.
Indeed, I am most lowly, insignificant and contemptible. I am also certainly
without the slightest trace of good karma or philosophical understanding, and I
am completely bereft of any proper virtuous behavior.


 


6)
All the assembled 
Vaisnavas
, who I consider to be
just like my spiritual master, have given me this title of 
Bhaktivinoda
,
but because I am actually totally devoid of any trace of devotion, this title
has simply become like a painful disease for me.


 


7)
Taking great care to check the spreading of this disease, I have taken refuge
at the lotus feet of all the 
Vaisnavas
.


 


8)
Taking the dust of the lotus feet of all the 
Vaisnavas

upon my head, this lowly 
Bhaktivinoda
 thus sings this
story called 
soka-satana
, (The Dispelling of Grief).*


 


REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:

Soka
 
Satana

PanditaÂ’s

sonÂ’s departure.
