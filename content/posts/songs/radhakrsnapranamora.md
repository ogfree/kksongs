WORD
FOR WORD TRANSLATION: 
Radha Krsna Prana
Mora


 


TRANSLATION


1) The
divine couple, Sri Sri Radha and Krsna, is my life and soul. In life or death I
have no other refuge but Them.


 


2) In
a forest of small kadamba trees on the bank of the Yamuna, I will seat the
divine couple on a throne made of brilliant jewels.


 


3) I
will anoint Their dark and fair forms with sandalwood paste scented with cuya,
and I will fan Them with a camara whisk. Oh, when will I behold Their moonlike
faces?


 


4)
After stringing together garlands of malati flowers I will place them around
Their necks, and I will offer tambula scented with camphor to Their lotus
mouths.


 


5)
With the permission of all the sakhis, headed by Lalita and Visakha, I will
serve the lotus feet of Radha and Krsna.


 


6)
Narottama dasa, the servant of the servant of Sri Krsna Caitanya Prabhu, longs
for this service to the divine couple.
