TRANSLATION


1) O 
Krsna
,
You satisfied and delighted the cows and the 
gopis
 of

Vrajabhumi
, who are the most fortunate of all
fortunate living entities. O Lord, You are eternally full of great auspiciousness,
and 
You
 are the friend of the residents of 
Vraja
.


 


2) O 
Krsna
,
You granted great happiness to Lord 
Brahmawho
 desired
the association of the residents of 
Vrajabhumi
. Lord
Brahma desired to take birth as a blade of grass in 
Vraja
,
so that he would become touched by the dust of the lotus feet of the great
devotees who were born there.


 


3) O 
Krsna
,
You grant 
Yourself
 tot he devotees situated in pure
love for you, and You feel greatly indebted to the residents of 
Vraja
. Simply because of the external appearance of
affection, 
You
 gave Yourself to the 
demoness
 
Putana
.


 


4) O 
Krsna
,
those who have given up this material world are able to attain 
You
, and those who are attached to this world cannot. O Lord
You 
are
 embarrassed by Your great debt to Your friends
in 
Vrndavana
 for their kind activities to You as You
play the role of their son etc.


 


5) O 
Krsna
,
even the humble devotees who consider that they are very foolish, and whose
minds are pure, cannot understand with their minds or with words the great extent
of 
Your
 
opulences
. O Lord,
to whom Lord Brahma offered respectful 
obeisances
,
one attains great bliss simply by constantly chanting Your Holy Name.
