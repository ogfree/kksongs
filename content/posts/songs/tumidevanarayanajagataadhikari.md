TRANSLATION


1)
You are Lord 
Narayana
, the master of the universes.
You are the creator, maintainer, and destroyer.


 


2)
You are the cause of everything, but 
You
 are 
nevr
 touched by matter. You incarnate among the demigods,
human beings, animals, and birds.


 


3)
You have created all living beings in this world of birth and death. You have
the power to save or to kill.


 


4)
You have given me this lowly form. No one can stop your order that a living
being have good or bad intelligence.


 


5)
How many vows, fasts, and acts of worship must 
Kaliya

have performed in the past that now he has attained 
Your

feet?


 


6)
Even if a person performs austerities for millions of births, he cannot become
free from 
Your
 illusory potency, Maya.


 


7)
For how many lifetimes did Goddess 
Laksmi
 perform
austerities before she was able to touch 
Your
 feet?


 


8)
I cannot explain how 
Kaliya
 became so fortunate that
his head became the resting place of 
Your
 lotus feet.


 


9)
By the touch of 
Your
 feet his birth as a snake in this
world became auspicious. By the touch of 
Your
 feet his
home in the waters of the 
Yamuna
 became auspicious. 


 


10)
Today the sun of the Supreme Lord's lotus feet has risen on the horizon of 
Kaliya's
 head, a sun that brings a new day of great good
fortune.


 


11)
After speaking these words, 
Kaliya's
 wives folded
their hands and said: O master of the demigods, please give us our husband.
Please give this gift to us.
