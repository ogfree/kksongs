TRANSLATION


1) Who will not take
shelter of 
Govardhana
 Hill, the best of mountains,
the friend of 
Gokula
, 
the

charming bumblebee that for seven days stood on the graceful whorl of the lotus
flower of Lord 
Krsna's
 hand and protected 
Vraja
 from the mouth of the 
Indra
-crocodile
raining a great monsoon?


 


2) What pious person will
not take shelter of 
Govardhana
 Hill, whose peak is
the place of pastimes for Lord Krsna, the master of the 
surabhi

cows, and near which is blissful 
Govinda-kunda
, where
a 
surabhi
 cow, followed by humbled 
Indra
 bearing the waters of the celestial Ganges, bathed
Lord Krsna and secretly crowned Him king of the 
surabhi

cows?


 


3) What pious person will
not take shelter of 
Govardhana
 Hill, which is
glorified by the great sages, and which is encircled by the lakes 
Siri-kunda
, Brahma-
kunda
, Hara-
kunda
, 
Apsarah-kunda
, 
Priyaka-kunda
, and Sri-
dana-kunda
,
which are splendid with the happiness of pure love and 
more
dear
 to Lord 
Hari
 than the celestial 
Ganges
 and a host of other sacred places?


 


4) Who will not take
shelter of 
Govardhana
 Hill, which is charming with
cows, deer, birds, and trees, and which is the place where the lakes 
Jyotsnamoksana-kunda
, 
Malya-kunda
,
Hara-
kunda
, 
Sumanah-kunda
, 
Gauri-kunda
, 
Balaridhvaja-kunda
, 
Gandharva-kunda
, many other lakes, many swiftly-moving
mountain streams, many lion-thrones for amorous pastimes, many places for Lord 
Hari's
 other pastimes, and the cowherd boy Lord 
Hari
 Himself, are all splendidly manifest?


 


5) Who will not take
shelter of 
Govardhana
 Hill? He who with always
devotedly caries on his bowed head the lake known as 
Syama-kunda
,
which is millions of times greater than the Ganges, and which was born from the
foot of Lord Krsna, becomes more dear to the Lord than even the demigod Siva.
He who in the same way carries the jewel known as 
Radha'-kunda

attains the full mercy of Lord Krsna. He becomes the most dear and glorious of
devotees.


 


6) Who will not take shelter
of 
Govardhana
 Hill, where the divine couple enjoy
Their rescue-fee pastimes, and where the 
Manasa-ganga

flows? In the 
Manasa-ganga
 the pilot 
Madhava
 took sweetly beautiful 
Radha
'
on His boat, and when She, frightened by a great storm, prayed that He calm it,
He claimed from Her as a rescue-fee the fulfillment of His amorous desires.


 


7) Ah, what pious person
will not take shelter of lofty 
Govardhana
 Hill, the
beautiful and transcendental place of the 
rasa
 dance,
where Sri 
Radha
, accompanied by Her beautiful friends
worshiped by hundreds of goddesses of fortune, and the splendid, nectar arm of
Lord Krsna playfully resting on Her neck, dances in the springtime 
rasa-lila
?


 


8) Who will not take
shelter of 
Govardhana
 Hill where, blossoming with
happiness at the outrageous joking words of Their friends, perpetually wounded
by the swift arrows shot from the corners of Their cruel, smiling eyes, and
laughing at the crooked words of the ever-new 
dana-keli

quarrel, the youthful divine couple displayed so many transcendental pastimes?


 


9) Who will not take
shelter of graceful and auspicious 
Govardhana
 Hill,
where, accompanied by 
Sridama
 and His other friends,
playing with 
Sankarsana
, and carefully herding the
cows, Lord Krsna happily sings 
ri
 
ri
,
and where Lord Krsna enjoys amorous pastimes with 
Radha
'
in the 
rasa
 dance arena and deep in the hidden caves?


 


10) Who will not take
shelter of 
Govardhana
 Hill, the crowned king of all
mountains? For the people of 
Vraja's
 sake Lord 
Mukunda
 neglected the sun-god's daughter 
Yamuna
, a host of other lofty hills, the wish-fulfilling 
forest
 of 
Vrndavana
, and the town of 
Nandisvara
, and respectfully worshiped 
Govardhana

Hill.


 


11) By the mercy of 
Govardhana
 Hill these ten beautiful verses about 
Govardhana
 Hill, which grant residence at 
Govardhana
 Hill, have come from the mouth of a blind old
man. The pleasure of 
Govardhana
 Hill, which is my
life and soul, and which is a beautiful jewel-mine of transcendental virtues,
is the ripe fruit I seek from my labor in writing these verses.
