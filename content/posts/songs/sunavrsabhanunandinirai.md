TRANSLATION


(Refrain)
O 
Radha
, O daughter of 
Vrsabhanu
,
please 
listen
. In the circle of young girls 
Your
 reputation was good in the past. But today that good
reputation is in disarray. 


 


1)

Nanda's
 son is a regal jewel. Delight resides in His
eyes. He loves 
You
. Why do 
You

flee so far from Him?


 


2)
You have made Him very unhappy. If He sees You He is overcome. O cruel girl,
why did 
You
 speak such words to Him, cruel words,
words like a lance pushed into His heart?


 


3)
For Your sake 
Your
 lover is now anointed with dust.
Now He cannot attain 
You
. In His left hand He rests
His head. Aimlessly scratching some letters in the ground, He weeps.


 


4)
No one knows what 
You
 two feel. Only 
You
 know what is truly in His heart. Please reflect on 
Ramacandra
 
Raya's
 words. This 
Govinda
 
dasa
 says.
