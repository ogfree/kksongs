TRANSLATION


1) O Lord 
krsna
, the 
gopis
 suffered greatly
and their senses became maddened by their constant crying. They then again saw 
Your
 smiling lotus face. O Lord, all glories unto 
You
.


 


2) O Lord 
Krsna
, decorated with yellow silken dhoti, 
You
 appeared like cupid in the form of a cowherd boy.
Surrounded by the cowherd men's wives, whose eyes were blossomed open with
great love, 
You
 returned to them their almost-lost
lives.


 


3) O Lord 
Krsna
, Your feet touched the 
gopi's

breasts and 
You
 became like a bumble-bee hovering over
the lotus flowers which are the 
gopi's
 eyes. You
removed the sufferings of the cowherd men's wives, and fulfilled all their
duties.


 


4) O Lord 
krsna
, seated in the assembly of 
gopis
,

You
 shone with transcendental beauty and opulence. The

gopis
 worshipped 
You
 as You
sat on the edge of the cloth they had spread out for You. O Lord, all glories
unto 
You
.
