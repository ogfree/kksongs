LYRICS:


(refrain)


ke ābār bājāy
bāḿśi e bhāńā kuÃ±jabane?


hṛdi mor uṭhalo
kāḿpi' caraṇer sei raṇane


 


(1)


koyelā ḍākalo
ābār, yamunāy lāgalo joyār


ke tumi ānile jal bhari' mor dui
nayane


 


(2)


āji mor śūnya
ḍālā, kī diye gāńthabo mālā?


keno ei niṭhura khelā khelile
āmār sane


 


(3)


hoy tumi thāmāo
bāḿśi, noy āmāy lao he āsi'-


gharete parabāsī thākite
ār pāri ne


 


TRANSLATION


(Refrain)
Who will play the flute again in the broken forest of Kunja? My heart is
beginning to tremble to the rhythm of His lotus feet.


 


1) The
koyala birds had called You again. The Yamuna River is feeling a strong tide,
as You have brought and filled the rivers with the tears of my two eyes.


 


2)
Alas! How can I string together flowers to make a garland, if my basket is
completely empty? Why is cruel fate playing with me in this way?


 


3) You
have stopped playing the flute and You do not come to me, here. I do not wish
to return to my home.
