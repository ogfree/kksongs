TRANSLATION


1) The delusion rooted deep
into my heart has taken the shape of desires for sense gratification. Thus in
my heart I am constantly trying to enjoy.


 


2) Alas! How much endeavor
have I made for such enjoyment? My delusions have not gone away, and I
understand that now in the end my life is departing.


 


3) This ghastly delusion
has made me extremely restless. I have not achieved any peace, and I am most
disturbed at heart.


 


4) When will 
Srila
 
Rupa
 
Gosvami

bestow his mercy upon me? When will he deliver me by bestowing upon me 
yukta
 
vairagya
? (The science of
renunciation which dovetails all favorable things in devotional service.)


 


5) When will 
Srila
 
Sanatana
 
Gosvami
 cause me to give up this materialistic sense
gratification? Being gracious to me, he will offer me in devotion to Lord 
Nityananda
 
Prabhu
.


 


6) When will 
Srila
 
Jiva
 
Gosvami

pour the waters of his strong conclusive truths and thereby extinguish the fire
of false arguments that burns my heart?


 


7) My jubilation will arise
when I hear the chanting of the holy name of Sri 
Krsna


Caitanya
, and by drinking the nectar of 
Radha-Krsna
 I will become free from all of my lamentations.


 


8) This rogue is not only
wicked amongst the wicked, but is the most wretched amongst the wretched.
Therefore he now begs for the shelter of the lotus feet of all the 
Vaisnavas
.
