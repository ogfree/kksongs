Language:

LYRICS:


(1)


Struggling in the mountains
of worldly desires


Falling in the caves of
lost consciousness


Stumbling through the
darkness of pain and illusion


Burning through the desert of
our own selfishness


 


(2)


Deep in the jungle of anger
of envy


Coming through of swaps of
casualness


Devoured by the fire of
lust that surrounds us


Here is the mist devoid of
happiness


 


(Refrain)


On and on and on and on,


We are trying to reach you,
Lord.


Seeking a taste of your
ocean of happiness


Reaching to the light that
is breaking through the darkness


Trying to escape from the
world of birth and death


 


(3)


Drowned by desires for
profit and exclusion


Crowned by with thorns of
adorationÂ’s quest


Haunted by the ghost of
merging in the oneness


Swallowed by the serpent of
sleep and ignorance


 


(4)


Cooling the fires with
rainfalls of mercy


Prabhupada
 has come to lead us back home


Dancing on the path of
Nectar of Devotion


Seeds for love of 
Krsna
 in our hearts are sown
