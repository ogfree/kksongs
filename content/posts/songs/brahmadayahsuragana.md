TRANSLATION


1) 
Prahlāda
 
Mahārāja
 prayed: How is it possible for me, who
have been born in a family of 
asuras
, to offer
suitable prayers to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead? Even until now,
all the demigods, headed by Lord 
Brahmā
, and all
the saintly persons, could not satisfy the Lord by streams of excellent words,
although such persons are very qualified, being in the mode of goodness. Then
what is to be said of me? I am not at all qualified. [8]


 


2) 
Prahlāda
 
Mahārāja
 continued: One may possess wealth, an
aristocratic family, beauty, austerity, education, sensory expertise, luster,
influence, physical strength, diligence, intelligence and mystic yogic power,
but I think that even by all these qualifications one cannot satisfy the
Supreme Personality of Godhead. However, one can satisfy the Lord simply by
devotional service. 
Gajendra
 did this, and thus the
Lord was satisfied with him. [9]


 


3) If a 
brāhmaṇa

has all twelve of the 
brahminical
 qualifications [as
they are stated in the book called 
Sanat-sujāta
]
but is not a devotee and is averse to the lotus feet of the Lord, he is
certainly lower than a devotee who is a dog-eater but who has dedicated
everything Â— mind, words, activities, wealth and life Â— to the Supreme Lord.
Such a devotee is better than such a 
brāhmaṇa

because the devotee can purify his whole family, whereas the so-called 
brāhmaṇa
 in a position of false prestige cannot
purify even 
himself
. [10]


 


4) The Supreme Lord, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, is always fully satisfied in Himself. Therefore when something is
offered to Him, the offering, by the Lord's mercy, is for the benefit of the
devotee, for the Lord does not need service from anyone. To give an example, if
one's face is decorated, the reflection of one's face in a mirror is also seen
to be decorated. [11]


 


5) Therefore, although I was born in a demoniac
family, I may without a doubt offer prayers to the Lord with full endeavor, as
far as my intelligence allows. Anyone who has been forced by ignorance to enter
the material world may be purified of material life if he offers prayers to the
Lord and hears the Lord's glories. [12]


 


6) O my Lord, all the demigods, headed by Lord 
Brahmā
, 
are
 sincere servants
of Your Lordship, who are situated in a transcendental position. Therefore they
are not like us [
Prahlāda
 and his father, the
demon 
Hiraṇyakaśipu
]. Your appearance in
this fearsome form is 
Your
 pastime for Your own
pleasure. Such an incarnation is always meant for the protection and
improvement of the universe. [13]


 


7) My Lord 
Nṛsiḿhadeva
,
please, therefore, 
cease
 Your anger now that my
father, the great demon 
Hiraṇyakaśipu
, has
been killed. Since even saintly persons take pleasure in the killing of a
scorpion or a snake, all the worlds have achieved great satisfaction because of
the death of this demon. Now they are confident of their happiness, and they
will always remember 
Your
 auspicious incarnation in
order to be free from fear. [14]


 


8) My Lord, who are never conquered by anyone, I am
certainly not afraid of 
Your
 ferocious mouth and
tongue, Your eyes bright like the sun or Your frowning eyebrows. I do not fear 
Your
 sharp, pinching teeth, Your garland of intestines, Your
mane soaked with blood, or Your high, 
wedgelike
 ears.
Nor do I fear 
Your
 tumultuous roaring, which makes
elephants flee to distant places, or Your nails, which are meant to kill Your
enemies. [15]


 


9) O most powerful, insurmountable Lord, who are
kind to the fallen souls, I have been put into the association of demons as a
result of my activities, and therefore I am very much afraid of my condition of
life within this material world. When will that moment come when 
You
 will call me to the shelter of Your lotus feet, which
are the ultimate goal for liberation from conditional life? [16]


 


10) O great one, O Supreme Lord, because of
combination with pleasing and displeasing circumstances and because of
separation from them, one is placed in a most regrettable position, within
heavenly or hellish planets, as if burning in a fire of lamentation. Although
there are many remedies by which to get out of miserable life, any such
remedies in the material world are more miserable than the miseries themselves.
Therefore I think that the only remedy is to engage in 
Your

service. Kindly instruct me in such service. [17]


 


11) O my Lord 
Nṛsiḿhadeva
,
by engaging in Your transcendental loving service in the association of
devotees who are liberated souls [
haḿsas
], I shall
become completely uncontaminated by the association of the three modes of
material nature and be able to chant the glories of Your Lordship, who are so
dear to me. I shall chant 
Your
 glories, following
exactly in the footsteps of Lord 
Brahmā
 and his 
disciplic
 succession. In this way I shall undoubtedly be
able to cross the ocean of nescience. [18]


 


12) My Lord 
Nṛsiḿhadeva
,
O Supreme, because of a bodily conception of life, embodied souls neglected and
not cared for by 
You
 cannot do anything for their
betterment. Whatever remedies they accept, although perhaps temporarily
beneficial, are certainly impermanent. For example, a father and mother cannot
protect their child, a physician and medicine cannot relieve a suffering
patient, and a boat on the ocean cannot protect a drowning man. [19]


 


13) My dear Lord, everyone in this material world is
under the modes of material nature, being influenced by goodness, passion and
ignorance. Everyone Â— from the greatest personality, Lord 
Brahmā
,
down to the small ant Â— works under the influence of these modes. Therefore
everyone in this material world is influenced by 
Your

energy. The cause for which they work, the place where they work, the time when
they work, the matter due to which they work, the goal of life they have
considered final, and the process for obtaining this goal Â— all are nothing but
manifestations of Your energy. Indeed, since the energy and energetic are
identical, all of them are but manifestations of 
You
.
[20]


 


14) O Lord, O supreme eternal, by expanding Your
plenary portion You have created the subtle bodies of the living entities
through the agency of Your external energy, which is agitated by time. Thus the
mind entraps the living entity in unlimited varieties of desires to be fulfilled
by the Vedic directions of karma-
kāṇḍa

[
fruitive
 activity] and the sixteen elements. Who can
get free from this entanglement unless he takes shelter at 
Your

lotus feet? [21]


 


15) My dear Lord, O supreme great, 
You
 have created this material world of sixteen
constituents, but You are transcendental to their material qualities. In other
words, these material qualities are under 
Your
 full
control, and You are never conquered by them. Therefore the time element is 
Your
 representation. My Lord, O Supreme, no one can conquer 
You
. As for me, however, I am being crushed by the wheel of
time, and therefore I surrender fully unto 
You
. Now
kindly take me under the protection of 
Your
 lotus
feet. [22]


 


16) My dear Lord, people in general want to be
elevated to the higher planetary systems for a long duration of life, opulence
and enjoyment, but I have seen all of these through the activities of my
father. When my father was angry and he laughed sarcastically at the demigods,
they were immediately vanquished simply by seeing the movements of his
eyebrows. Yet my father, who was so powerful, has now been vanquished by 
You
 within a moment. [23]


 


17) My dear Lord, now I have complete experience
concerning the worldly opulence, mystic power, longevity and other material
pleasures enjoyed by all living entities, from Lord 
Brahmā

down to the ant. As powerful time, 
You
 destroy them
all. Therefore, because of my experience, I do not wish to possess them. My
dear Lord, I request 
You
 to place me in touch with
Your pure devotee and let me serve him as a sincere servant. [24]


 


18) In this material world, every living entity
desires some future happiness, which is exactly like a mirage in the desert.
Where is water in the desert, or, in other words, where is happiness in this
material world? As for this body, what is its value? It is merely a source of
various diseases. The so-called philosophers, scientists and politicians know
this very well, but nonetheless they aspire for temporary happiness. Happiness
is very difficult to obtain, but because they are unable to control their
senses, they run after the so-called happiness of the material world and never
come to the right conclusion. [25]


 


19) O my Lord, O Supreme, because I was born in a
family full of the hellish material qualities of passion and ignorance, what is
my position? And what is to be said of 
Your
 causeless
mercy, which was never offered even to Lord 
Brahmā
,
Lord 
Śiva
 or the goddess of fortune, 
Lakṣmī
? You never put 
Your

lotus hand upon their heads, but You have put it upon mine. [26]


 


20) Unlike an ordinary living entity, my Lord, You
do not discriminate between friends and enemies, the favorable and the
unfavorable, because for 
You
 there is no conception of
higher and lower. Nonetheless, 
You
 offer Your
benedictions according to the level of one's service, exactly as a desire tree
delivers fruits according to one's desires and makes no distinction between the
lower and the higher. [27]


 


21) My dear Lord, O Supreme Personality of Godhead,
because of my association with material desires, one after another, I was
gradually falling into a blind well full of snakes, following the general
populace. But 
Your
 servant 
Nārada


Muni
 kindly accepted me as his disciple and
instructed me how to achieve this transcendental position. Therefore, my first
duty is to serve him. How could I leave his service? [28]


 


22) My Lord, O unlimited reservoir of transcendental
qualities, 
You
 have killed my father, 
Hiraṇyakaśipu
, and saved me from his sword. He
had said very angrily, "If there is any supreme controller other than me,
let Him save you. I shall now sever your head from your body." Therefore I
think that both in saving me and in killing him, 
You
 have
acted just to prove true the words of Your devotee. There is no other cause.
[29]


 


23) My dear Lord, You alone manifest 
Yourself
 as the entire cosmic manifestation, for You existed
before the creation, You exist after the annihilation, and You are the
maintainer between the beginning and the end. All this is done by 
Your
 external energy through actions and reactions of the
three modes of material nature. Therefore whatever exists Â— externally and
internally Â— 
is
 You alone. [30]


 


24) My dear Lord, O Supreme Personality of Godhead,
the entire cosmic creation is caused by 
You
, and the
cosmic manifestation is an effect of Your energy. Although the entire cosmos is
but 
You
 alone, You keep Yourself aloof from it. The
conception of "mine and yours," is certainly a type of illusion [
māyā
] because everything is an emanation from 
You
 and is therefore not different from You. Indeed, the
cosmic manifestation is 
nondifferent
 from 
You
, and the annihilation is also caused by You. This
relationship between Your Lordship and the cosmos is illustrated by the example
of the seed and the tree, or the subtle cause and the gross manifestation. [31]


 


25) O my Lord, O Supreme Personality of Godhead,
after the annihilation the creative energy is kept in 
You
,
who appear to sleep with half-closed eyes. Actually, however, 
You
 do not sleep like an ordinary human being, for You are
always in a transcendental stage, beyond the creation of the material world,
and You always feel transcendental bliss. As 
Kāraṇodakaśāyī


Viṣṇu
, You thus remain in 
Your
 transcendental status, not touching material objects.
Although 
You
 appear to sleep, this sleeping is
distinct from sleeping in ignorance. [32]


 


26) This cosmic manifestation, the material world,
is also 
Your
 body. This total lump of matter is
agitated by 
Your
 potent energy known as 
kāla-śakti
, and thus the three modes of material
nature are manifested. You awaken from the bed of 
Śeṣa
,

Ananta
, and from 
Your
 navel
a small transcendental seed is generated. It is from this seed that the lotus
flower of the gigantic universe is manifested, exactly as a banyan tree grows
from a small seed. [33]


 


27) From that great lotus flower, 
Brahmā
 was generated, but 
Brahmā

certainly could see nothing but the lotus. Therefore, thinking 
You
 to be outside, Lord 
Brahmā

dove into the water and attempted to find the source of the lotus for one
hundred years. He could find no trace of 
You
, however,
for when a seed fructifies, the original seed cannot be seen. [34]


 


28) Lord 
Brahmā
, who
is celebrated as 
ātma
-yoni, having been born
without a mother, was struck with wonder. Thus he took shelter of the lotus
flower, and when he had been purified after undergoing severe austerities for
many hundreds of years, he could see that the cause of all causes, the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, was spread throughout his own body and senses, just as
aroma, although very subtle, is perceived in the earth. [35]


 


29) Lord 
Brahmā
 could
then see 
You
 possessing thousands and thousands of
faces, feet, heads, hands, thighs, noses, ears and eyes. You were very nicely
dressed, being decorated and bedecked with varieties of ornaments and weapons.
Seeing 
You
 in the form of Lord 
Viṣṇu
,
Your symptoms and form being transcendental, Your legs extending from the lower
planets, Lord 
Brahmā
 achieved transcendental
bliss. [36]


 


30) My dear Lord, when 
You

appeared as 
Hayagrīva
, with the head of a horse,
You killed two demons known as 
Madhu
 and 
Kaiṭabha
, who were full of the modes of passion and
ignorance. Then 
You
 delivered the Vedic knowledge to
Lord 
Brahmā
. For this reason, all the great
saints accept 
Your
 forms as transcendental, 
untinged
 by material qualities. [37]


 


31) In this way, my Lord, You appear in various
incarnations as a human being, an animal, a great saint, a demigod, a fish or a
tortoise, thus maintaining the entire creation in different planetary systems
and killing the demoniac principles. According to the age, O my Lord, You
protect the principles of religion. In the age of Kali, however, 
You
 do not assert Yourself as the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, and therefore You are known as 
Triyuga
, or
the Lord who appears in three 
yugas
. [38]


 


32) My dear Lord of the 
Vaikuṇṭha

planets, where there is no anxiety, my mind is extremely sinful and lusty,
being sometimes so-called happy and sometimes so-called distressed. My mind is
full of lamentation and fear, and it always seeks more and more money. Thus it has
become most polluted and is never satisfied in topics concerning 
You
. I am therefore most fallen and poor. In such a status
of life, how shall I be able to discuss 
Your

activities? [39]


 


33) My dear Lord, O infallible one, my position is
like that of a person who has many wives, all trying to attract him in their
own way. For example, the tongue is attracted to palatable dishes, the genitals
to sex with an attractive woman, and the sense of touch to contact with soft
things. The belly, although filled, still wants to eat more, and the ear, not
attempting to hear about 
You
, is generally attracted
to cinema songs. The sense of smell is attracted to yet another side, the
restless eyes are attracted to scenes of sense gratification, and the active
senses are attracted elsewhere. In this way I am certainly embarrassed. [40]


 


34) My dear Lord, You are always transcendentally
situated on the other side of the river of death, but because of the reactions
of our own activities, we are suffering on this side. Indeed, we have fallen
into this river and are repeatedly suffering the pains of birth and death and
eating horrible things. Now kindly look upon us Â— not only upon me but also
upon all others who are suffering Â— and by 
Your

causeless mercy and compassion, deliver us and maintain us. [41]


 


35) O my Lord, O Supreme Personality of Godhead,
original spiritual master of the entire world, what is the difficulty for 
You
, who manage the affairs of the universe, in delivering
the fallen souls engaged in Your devotional service? You are the friend of all
suffering humanity, and for great personalities it is necessary to show mercy
to the foolish. Therefore I think that 
You
 will show
Your causeless mercy to persons like us, who engage in Your service. [42]


 


36) O best of the great personalities, I am not at
all afraid of material existence, for wherever I stay I am fully absorbed in
thoughts of 
Your
 glories and activities. My concern is
only for the fools and rascals who are making elaborate plans for material
happiness and maintaining their families, societies and countries. I am simply
concerned with love for them. [43]


 


37) My dear Lord 
Nṛsiḿhadeva
,
I see that there are many saintly persons indeed, but they are interested only
in their own deliverance. Not caring for the big cities and towns, they go to
the Himalayas or the forest to meditate with vows of silence [
mauna-vrata
]. They are not interested in delivering others.
As for me, however, I do not wish to be liberated alone, leaving aside all
these poor fools and rascals. I know that without 
Kṛṣṇa

consciousness, without taking shelter of 
Your
 lotus
feet, one cannot be happy. Therefore I wish to bring them back to shelter at 
Your
 lotus feet. [44]


 


38) Sex life is compared to the rubbing of two hands
to relieve an itch. 
Gṛhamedhis
, so-called 
gṛhasthas
 who have no spiritual knowledge, think that
this itching is the greatest platform of happiness, although actually it is a
source of distress. The 
kṛpaṇas
, the
fools who are just the opposite of 
brāhmaṇas
,
are not satisfied by repeated sensuous enjoyment. 
Those who
are 
dhīra
, however, who are sober and who
tolerate this itching, are not subjected to the sufferings of fools and
rascals.
 [45]


 


39) O Supreme Personality of Godhead, there are ten
prescribed methods on the path to liberation Â— to remain silent, not to speak
to anyone, to observe vows, to amass all kinds of Vedic knowledge, to undergo
austerities, to study the Vedas and other Vedic literatures, to execute the
duties of 
varṇāśrama
-dharma, to explain
the 
śāstras
, to stay in a solitary place,
to chant mantras silently, and to be absorbed in trance. These different
methods for liberation are generally only a professional practice and means of
livelihood for those who have not conquered their senses. Because such persons
are falsely proud, these procedures may not be successful. [46]


 


40) By authorized Vedic knowledge one can see that
the forms of cause and effect in the cosmic manifestation belong to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, for the cosmic manifestation is His energy. Both cause
and effect are nothing but energies of the Lord. Therefore, O my Lord, just as
a wise man, by considering cause and effect, can see how fire pervades wood,
those engaged in devotional service understand how You are both the cause and
effect. [47]


 


41) O Supreme Lord, You are actually the air, the
earth, fire, sky and water. You are the objects of sense perception, the life
airs, the five senses, the mind, consciousness and false ego. Indeed, 
You
 are everything, subtle and gross. The material elements
and anything expressed, either by the words or by the mind, are nothing but 
You
. [48]


 


42) Neither the three modes of material nature [
sattva-guṇa
, 
rajo-guṇa

and 
tamo-guṇa
], nor the predominating deities
controlling these three modes, nor the five gross elements, nor the mind, nor
the demigods nor the human beings can understand Your Lordship, for they are
all subjected to birth and annihilation. Considering this, the spiritually
advanced have taken to devotional service. Such wise men hardly bother with
Vedic study. Instead, they engage themselves in practical devotional service.
[49]


 


43) Therefore, O Supreme Personality of Godhead, the
best of all persons to whom prayers are offered, I offer my respectful 
obeisances
 unto You because without rendering six kinds of
devotional service unto You Â— offering prayers, dedicating all the results of
activities, worshiping You, working on Your behalf, always remembering Your
lotus feet and hearing about Your glories Â— who can achieve that which is meant
for the 
paramahaḿsas
? [50]
