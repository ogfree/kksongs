TRANSLATION

1) More sweet than all other sweet things; more auspicious than all other
auspicious things; the greatest purifier of all purifying things. The holy name
of Sri Hari alone is everything. [11]


 


2) The
entire universe, from exalted Brahma down to the lowly clump of grass, is a
product of the illusory energy of the supreme Lord. The only thing that is
reality, reality, again I say reality. The holy name of Sri Hari alone is
everything. [39]


 


3) That
person is a true preceptor, or a true father, a true mother, and a true friend
also only if they teach one to always remember. The holy name of Sri Hari alone
is everything. [50]


 


4) There
is no certainty when the last breath will come and put an abrupt halt to all
oneÂ’s material plans; therefore, it is wise to always practice chanting from
very childhood. The holy name of Sri Hari alone is everything. [57]


 


5) Lord
Hari eternally dwells in that place where truly exalted, spiritually advanced
souls sing in the mood of pure devotion. The holy name of Sri Hari alone is
everything. [62]


 


6) Aho!
What a sorrow, what a great sorrow! More painful than any other misery in the
world! Mistaking it as a mere piece of glass, the people have forgotten this
jewel. The holy name of Sri Hari alone is everything. [77]


 


7) It
should be heard again and again with oneÂ’s ears; It should be uttered over and
over with oneÂ’s voice; It should be perpetually sung and sung anew. The holy
name of Sri Hari alone is everything. [89]


 


8) It
makes the entire universe seem insignificant as a blade of grass; it reigns
supreme over all in a splendorous manner; it is full of eternally conscious
divine ecstasy; it is supremely pure. The holy name of Sri Hari alone is
everything. [99]
