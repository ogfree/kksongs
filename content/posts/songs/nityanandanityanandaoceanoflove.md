LYRICS:


(1)


Nityananda,
Nityananda:


Ocean
of Love, Mercy and Bliss.


You
are the Way, the only Way


To
Caitannya's sweet Lotus Feet.


You're
begging us to chant and dance,


And
follow You in Harinama.


 


(Refrain)


Chant
and dance, chant and dance, chant and dance, chant and dance.


Gurudeva,
Gurudeva, Gurudeva, Gurudeva.


Nitaicandra,
Nitaicandra, Nitaicandra, Nitaicandra.


Gauracandra,
Gauracandra, Gauracandra, Gauracandra.


Hare
Krsna Hare Krsna Krsna Krsna Hare Hare


Hare
Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare hare


 


(2)


Nityananda,
Nityananda:


The
Nectar of Your Lotus Feet


Is
already pouring on us.


Just a
drop will wash all sins.


What
can we say, what can we do?


The
answer is, needless to say:


 


(3)


Nityananda,
Nityananda:


Envy
and greed, anger and lust,


Harshness,
disease, darkness and death


Fade
away in Your Lotus Hands.


With
Prasadam and Harinama,


To
Vaikuntha, You show the Way.


 


(4)


Nityananda,
Nityananda:


By
Your Mercy and Gurudeva's,


I have
Your Name and Your Mission


To
remember and carry on.


 


(5)


For a
droplet of Your Mercy,


and a
glance from Your Lotus Eyes,


With
all my heart, with all my strength


I
surrender and promise to:
