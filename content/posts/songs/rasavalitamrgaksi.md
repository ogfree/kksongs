TRANSLATION


1)
When will Sri Radhika, who is a splendid ruby in the crown of all nectarean
doe-eyed girls, a swan swimming in the lake of love for jubilant Lord Krsna,
and a celestial vine sprouted from Vraja's exalted King Vrsabhanu, bathe me in
Her service?


 


2)
When will Sri Radhika, who makes the sash of bells dance on Her hips splendid
with red silk, and whose necklace of large pearls plays on the waterpots of Her
breasts, bathe me in Her service?


 


3)
When will Sri Radhika, who is as splendid as a great lotus whorl, who is new
nectar mixed with the camphor of youth, and whose bimba fruit lips blossom with
a gentle smile, bathe me in Her service?


 


4)
When will Sri Radhika, who, accidentally meeting restless Krsna in the
outskirts of the forest, stared at Him with suspicious eyes as He cast amorous
glances at Her and flattered Her with many sweet and gentle words, bathe me in
Her service?


 


5)
When will Sri Radhika, who the girls of Vraja love as much as their own lives,
who the gopa queen Yasoda loves as much as Lord Krsna, and who makes the heart
of charming Lalita blossom with love, bathe me in Her service?


 


6)
When will Sri Radhika, who in the company of Visakha at the forest's edge
strings a Vaijayanti garland from the flowers of many trees, and who is the
beautiful beloved resting on Lord Krsna's handsome chest, bathe me in Her
service?


 


7)
When will Sri Radhika, who smelling the fragrance of Lord Krsna and hearing the
sweet sounds of His flute, ran to Him in the forest grove and, scratching Her
ears, approached Him with smiling eyes and lowered face, bathe me in Her
service?


 


8)
When will Sri Radhika, who on a summer evening happily plays with Lord Krsna by
Her own lake cooled by breezes touching the many splendid lotuses, bathe me in
Her service?


 


9)
Pleased with any person who, abandoning all hope of material happiness and
overwhelmed with love, reads this sweet Sri Radhastaka with a pure heart, the
prince of Vraja of His own accord places him among Sri Radha's personal
associates.
