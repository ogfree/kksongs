TRANSLATION


1)
O Krsna, taking breakfast early in the morning, 
You

wandered in 
Vrndavana
, placing the calves in front.
It was there that 
You
 saw the demon 
Bakasura
, whose gigantic body appeared just like a mountain
peak.


 


2)
O Krsna, when 
You
 were swallowed by 
Bakasura
 with His sharp beak, Your cowherd friends fainted.
Staying within the demon's mouth, 
You
 playfully burned
his palate.


 


3)
O Krsna, expelled form the 
Baka
 demonÂ’s mouth, 
You
 bifurcated his beak (and killed him). 
Balarama
 and the other cowherd boys embraced 
You
, and the demigods praised You and showered flowers upon
You. All glories to 
You
.
