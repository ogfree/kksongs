TRANSLATION


1) All glories to the
effulgent 
arati
 of Sri 
Gurudeva
,
which is going on at the foot of 
Govarddhan
, 
benefitting
 the whole world.


 


2) All glories to Sri 
Bhakti
 
Sundar
 
Govinda


Goswami
, who is our supreme master and is like a
reservoir of joy.


 


3) His graceful long hands
touch his knees and his body is beautiful and transcendental. He is an ocean of
infinite genius and transcendental qualities.


 


4) We consider your real
identity to be non-different from 
Krsna
 and 
Gauranga
. But now, to deliver this material world, you have
assumed the form of a pure devotee.


 


5) You are brightening the
line of the followers of Sri 
Rupa
 
Goswami
.
Your effulgence, which is comparable to that of the sun, is known throughout
the whole world.


 


6) There is no one like you
to preach pure devotion. You are the spotless moon, and you are merciful like
Lord 
Nityananda
.


 


7) As ecstatic people all
over the world are attaining the treasure of love of 
Krsna
,
they are dancing and singing your glories.


 


8) To teach the essence of
the highest knowledge and to preach it to all, you have established many
ashrams all over the world.


 


9) You have mastery over
the knowledge of the Vedas, both conceivable and inconceivable. You are the
treasurer of bona fide conclusions, which can destroy all doubt.


 


10) Your glories are being
sung in the spiritual world of 
Goloka
, the realm of
your pastimes, by your servants who are eternally liberated.


 


11) To deliver the fallen
souls, you are like a breeze of mercy. You are expert in all service, and you
are 
estabished
 in truth and gravity.


 


12) Your beautiful and unprecedented
writing reflects your deep scholarship. You are always smiling and speaking
sweet words, which remind one of your soothing poetry.


 


13) You are always
straightforward and humble, and you are always joyful in the association of
pure devotees. In a spiritual gathering, you are always the best speaker. In
every field of life, you always come out victorious.


 


14) In the sky of the 
GauÃ iya
 
Vaisnava
 world, you are a
preceptor who is prominent like the sun. You are always fond of service, and
your sweet voice inspires others to do service also.


 


15) Past, present, and
futureÂ—for all eternity, we beg your mercy. Only by your mercy will one receive
devotional service to Sri 
Sri
 
Gandharvvika-Giridhari
.


 


16) O my lord, who is the
manifestation of the mercy of Sri 
Gauranga
, please 
be
 merciful to me. This insignificant servant of yours is
always praying this way while worshipping you.
