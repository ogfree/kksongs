TRANSLATION


1)
O brothers! Mother Yasoda and Mother Rohini were thinking, "Today our two
boys, Balarama and Krsna, will go to a distant forest to tend Their cows."
Contemplating thus in the ecstasy of parental affection, they prepared a
wonderful feast for the two boys, consisting of khira, solid cream, curd, and
fresh yellow butter.


 


2)
All the cowherd boyfriends take lunch with Balarama and Krsna while dancing and
singing in ecstasy. They eat the remnants of Krsna's meal until their bellies
are full, and still exclaim, "Give us more! Give us more!"


 


REMARKS/EXTRA
INFORMATION:


This
sung is to be sung when offering to the child forms of Krsna (bāla-bhoga).
