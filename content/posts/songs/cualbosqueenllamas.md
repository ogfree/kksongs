LYRICS:


(1)


Cual
bosque en llamas, el mundo nos quema,


Para
salvarnos como una nube vienes,


Del
mar de gracia de Krsna nos llueves,


Â¡Tus
pies de loto adoro, Gurudeva!


 


(2)


En el kirtan
de Goura cantas y bailas


Con
bella mÃºsica, Tu ser se alegra,


Tu
piel se eriza, lloras y tiemblas,


Â¡Tus
pies de loto adoro, Gurudeva!


 


(3)


A
adorar Tus deidades Te dedicas,


Las
vistes y adornas, su templo limpias,


Tus
bhaktas ocupas de esta manera,


Â¡Tus
pies de loto adoro, Gurudeva!


 


(4)


Cuando
las cuatro clases de prasadam,


En
rica fiesta, a los bhaktas son dadas,


Tu
corazÃ³n de alegrÃ­a se llena,


Â¡Tus
pies de loto adoro, Gurudeva!


 


(5)


El
Madhurya de Radhika y Madhava,


Su
calidad, forma y nombres anhelas,


Sus
infinitas glorias proclamas,


Â¡Tus
pies de loto adoro, Gurudeva!


 


(6)


En
asistir el lila de Radha y Krsna,


En
todo lo que las gopis desean,


Querido
a ellas sabes bien servirlas,


Â¡Tus
pies de loto adoro, Gurudeva!


 


(7)


Las cualidades
de Hari en Ti hallan,


Sastras
y sadhus, que nos lo revelan,


Por
ello a Ti, El SeÃ±or tanto te ama,


Â¡Tus
pies de loto adoro, Gurudeva!


 


(8)


Por Tu
gracia nos bendice Krsna,


Sin Tu
gracia en verdad nada prospera,


Tus
glorias canto tres veces al dÃ­a,


Â¡Tus
pies de loto adoro, Gurudeva!.


 


(9)


Quien
canta este astakam a Gurudeva


En
Brahma muhurta con devociÃ³n


Al rey
de Vrindavan hace su seva


Y
alcanza el fruto de la perfecciÃ³n


 


TRANSLATION


1)
The spiritual master is receiving benediction from the ocean of mercy. Just as
a cloud pours water on a forest fire to extinguish it, so the spiritual master
delivers the materially afflicted world by extinguishing the blazing fire of
material existence. I offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of such
a spiritual master, who is an ocean of auspicious qualities.


 


2)
Chanting the holy name, dancing in ecstasy, singing, and playing musical
instruments, the spiritual master is always gladdened by the sankirtana
movement of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu. Because he is relishing the mellows of
pure devotion within his mind, sometimes his hair stands on end, he feels
quivering in his body, and tears flow from his eyes like waves. I offer my
respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of such a spiritual master.


 


3)
The spiritual master is always engaged in the temple worship of Sri Sri Radha
and Krsna. He also engages his disciples in such worship. They dress the
Deities in beautiful clothes and ornaments, clean Their temple, and perform
other similar worship of the Lord. I offer my respectful obeisances unto the
lotus feet of such a spiritual master.


 


4)
The spiritual master is always offering Krsna four kinds of delicious food
[analyzed as that which is licked, chewed, drunk, and sucked]. When the
spiritual master sees that the devotees are satisfied by eating bhagavat-prasada,
he is satisfied. I offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of such a
spiritual master.


 


5)
The spiritual master is always eager to hear and chant about the unlimited
conjugal pastimes of Radhika and Madhava, and Their qualities, names, and
forms. The spiritual master aspires to relish these at every moment. I offer my
respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of such a spiritual master.


 


6)
The spiritual master is very dear, because he is expert in assisting the
gopīs, who at different times make different tasteful arrangements for the
perfection of Radha and KrsnaÂ’s conjugal loving affairs within the groves of Vrndavana.
I offer my most humble obeisances unto the lotus feet of such a spiritual
master.


 


7)
The spiritual master is to be honored as much as the Supreme Lord, because he
is the most confidential servitor of the Lord. This is acknowledged in all
revealed scriptures and followed by all authorities. Therefore I offer my
respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of such a spiritual master, who is a
bona fide representative of Sri Hari [Krsna].


 


8)
By the mercy of the spiritual master one receives the benediction of Krsna
Without the grace of the spiritual master, one cannot make any advancement.
Therefore, I should always remember and praise the spiritual master. At least
three times a day I should offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet
of my spiritual master.


 


9)
One who, with great care and alteration, loudly recites this beautiful prayer
to the spiritual master during the Brahma-muhurta obtains direct service to
Krsna, the Lord of Vrndavana, at the time of his death.
