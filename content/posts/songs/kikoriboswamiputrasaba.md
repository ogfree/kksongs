TRANSLATION


1)
O Lord, what can our husbands, children, and relatives do to stop us from
taking shelter of Your feet? When someone remembers You, all the bonds of
material existence are broken.


 


2)
Now that we have seen Your lotus feet, we do not like the touch of our
husbands.


 


3)
You are our husband. You are our children. You are our relatives. You are our
friend. You are 
Narayana
. We desire You.


 


4)
Why should we return to the doors of our homes? Our homes are 
maya
. Except You, nothing is true. Everything else is the
bewildering riddle posed by Maya.


 


5)
No one has the power to understand or describe all of Your limitless glories in
this world.


 


6)
Siva, 
Sukadeva
, 
Narada
, 
Prahlada
, Bali, 
Sanaka
, 
Sanatana
, and 
Dhruva
 may
understand a little something of 
Your
 glories. 


 


7)
Brahma and all the sages cannot find the end of Your glories. All the devotees
sing about Your transcendental virtues.


 


8)
You are Lord 
Narayana
. In Your humanlike form You
enjoy pastimes in 
Vrndavana
.


 


9)
We will see You again and again in our thoughts. How many austerities did we
perform in our past births that we can now see You with our eyes?


 


10)
O Lord 
Narayana
, we beg You: please be merciful and
accept this food we bring to You. Now with our own eyes we can see Your feet.


 


11)
After many births, we have attained Your feet. Now our lives are a success.


 


REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:
