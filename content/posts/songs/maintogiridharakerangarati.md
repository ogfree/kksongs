TRANSLATION


Refrain: I am colored in love for 
Giridhari
.


 


1) The girls are wearing the outfit known as 
pacaranga
 and playing the 
Rajasthani

game of 
jhuramuta
. During this game of 
jhuramuta
, I meet my Beloved One, open my veil, and sing my
heart to Him.


 


2) Other people have lovers living in other
countries. They write to them to communicate to them. My lover lives in my
heart. I stay up all night talking to Him.


 


3) I do not go to my family or my in-laws. I give my
Lord the signal. Mira 
Bai
 says to her courtly 
Giridhara
, Â“I will remain at 
Your

feet, day and night.Â”
