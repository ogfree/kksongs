TRANSLATION


1)
The two philosophiesÂ—advaita-vada, or monism, from Vedanta and materialism from
SarikhyaÂ—have been current from time immemorial. Monism has been further
divided into two, namely vivarta-vdda and Mayavada. Among all these philosophers,
some say the material world is a transformation of Brahman, some say it is
false, and some have established the material world as beginningless. Swanlike
persons, however, say that although Lord Krsna is separate from all activities
and their cause, by His inconÂ­ceivable potency and through His three principle
energies the Lord is nevertheless present and involved in the activities of
Vaikuntha, the living entities, and the material world.


 


2)
Sri Krsna is personally present in spiritual activities. He is present as
Supersoul in the living entities, and He is worshiped as YaÂ­jnesvara in the
material world. He alone awards the results of all activities.


 


3)
All the existing personal expansions and all the created sepa. rated
expansions, the living entities, are products of Krsna's energy, therefore Lord
Sri Krsna is the origin of all expansions. Nothing can manifest outside of His
energy, therefore He is the source of all forms. All incarnations of the Lord
emanate from Him, therefore He is the source of all incarnations. Lord Sri
Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There is no truth superior to Him.


 


4)
That Krsna is inconceivably powerful and merciful. He is arÂ­dently engaged in
the welfare of the living entities who have been conditioned by Maya due to
misuse of their independence.


 


5)
When the conditioned souls receive various forms according to their nature, the
Supreme Lord Krsna, by His inconceivable poÂ­tency, agrees to accompany them by
incarnating and enjoying pastimes with them. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 


 


6)
When the living entities accept the position of fish, the Lord accepts His fish
incarnation, Matsya. Matsya is without danda. When the living entities
gradually accept the position of vajra-danda, then the Lord incarnates as
Kurma. When vajra-danda gradually becomes meru-danda, the Lord incarnates as
Varaha.


 


7)
When the living entities accept the combined position of incarnation of human
and animal, the Lord accepts His incarnation of Nrsimha. When the living entities
are short, He appears as Vamana. When the living entities are uncivilized, He
comes as Parasurama. When they are civilized, He appears as Ramacandra.


 


8)
When the living entities possess the wealth of practical knowlÂ­edge, then Lord
Krsna Himself appears. When the living entities develop the tendency for
argument, the Lord appears as Buddha. And when they are atheistic, the Lord
comes as Kalki. These are well-known facts.


 


9)
In the course of the gradual development of the living entities' hearts, the Lord
incarnates in a form material contamination.


 


10
Â– 11) After consideration, the sages have divided the history of the living
entities' advancement into ten periods of time. Each period has different
symptoms, with each successive mood superior to the previous. Each progressive
mood is described as an incarnation.


 


12)
Some learned scholars have divided this period of time into twenty-four and
ascertained twenty-four incarnations. Yet there are others who have divided it into
eighteen with the correspondÂ­ing number of incarnations.


 


13)
Some people say that the Supreme Lord is omnipotent, therefore He may sometimes
incarnate by His inconceivable energy in a material body, and all incarnations
can therefore be accepted simply as historical incidents. According to the
opinion of swanlike Vaisnavas, this statement is extremely unreasonable because
it is impossible for Lord Krsna to accept a material body and perform material
activities. Such action would be insignificant and abomiÂ­nable for Him. But His
appearance and pastimes in the hearts of the realized living entities' are
accepted by both the sadhus and Krsna.


 


14-15)
As the sun cannot enjoy its shadow, Krsna cannot enjoy maya. What to speak of
Krsna enjoying maya. He is not even seen by persons who are under the shelter
of maya. Yet simply by the mercy of Krsna one can easily see Him through samadhi.


 


16)
The pure activities of Krsna have been perceived through the samadhi of
swanlike persons like Vyasadeva. Krsna's activities are not exactly historical
like those of people under the clutches of maya, because Krsna's activities are
not limited to any time or place. Nor are His activities comparable with the
activities of ordinary people.


 


17)
After careful consideration and by the mercy of Sri Krsna Caitanya we will
herein briefly describe the activities of Krsna.


 


18)
The explanation on the science of Krsna that is presented in this book may be
applied to His various incarnations. The concluÂ­sion is that Krsna is the root
cause and seed of all incarnations. He is eternally enjoying pastimes with the
living entities as the Super-soul. The Supersoul reciprocates according to the
mood and realization a living entity acquires while traveling on the path of
fruitive activities. But Krsna does not personally appear until spiriÂ­tual
attachment arises in the hearts of the living entities. Therefore all other
incarnations appear from the Supersoul, of whom Krsna is the original seed.


Â 


19)
We appeal to the swanlike Vaisnavas to ignore the imperfections of these verses
and happily relish Krsna's activities, which are the essence and wealth of all
living entities.


 


20)
Regarding these descriptions of Krsna's activities, despite much effort we were
unable to restrain our intelligence from considerations of time and space,
because we are not free from the pangs of material life.


 


21)
Still, after drinking the shower of mercy from Sri Gauracandra the son of Saci
and our only guide, let whatever little we have described herein enter the
hearts of all living entities to fill the absence of krsna-rasa; that is, let
everyone relish the transcendenÂ­tal mellows in relationship with Krsna.
