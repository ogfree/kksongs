TRANSLATION


1)
All glories, all glories to Lord 
Jagannatha
, Whose
complexion is that of a dark rain-cloud and 
Who
 is
Lord 
Krsna
 Himself.


 


2)
All glories, all glories to Lord 
Jagannatha
, who is
the abode of transcendental qualities, who resides eternally in 
Nilacala
 exhibiting wonderful pastimes.


 


3)
All glories, all glories to Lord 
Jagannatha
, Who is
absorbed in His own ecstasy (
vipralambha-bhava
), 
Who
 performs the pastimes of 
ratha-yatra

on the shore of the milk ocean.


 


4)
All glories, all glories to Sri 
Caitanya
 
Mahaprabhu
, Who is known as 
Gauranga-sundara
,

Whose
 external complexion is golden like 
Srimati
 
Radharani
, but Who is 
Krsna
 within.


 


5)
All glories, all glories to Sri 
Gadadhara
, who is the
greatest devotee (of 
Mahaprabhu
) and who is the
entire wealth of the feelings, sentiment, mood and luster of Sri 
Radhika
, the daughter of King 
Vrsabhanu
.


 


6)
All glories, all glories to Lord 
Jagannatha
, Sri 
Caitanya
 and Sri 
Gadadhara
. These
three Lords are my only shelter. These Lords are the very life of my life.
