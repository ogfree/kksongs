TRANSLATION


1) His glorious youthful
handsomeness was beyond anything in this world. The splashing waves of his
gentle smile would make even 
Kamadeva
 faint in bliss.


 


2) Who was that handsome
boy? What happened to me when I saw Him? My peaceful composure fled far away.
Now my heart is always agitated. Why do I always weep?


 


3) Smiling and smiling, and
His limbs swaying to and fro, He danced and danced as He walked. From the
corner of His eye He shot a fearsome sharp arrow, an arrow that pierced my
life's breath.


 


4) Hanging from His neck, a
jasmine garland swayed to and fro on His chest. Rising and falling, intoxicated
black bees flew around and around its flowers.


 


5) Sandal-paste 
tilaka
 glistened on His forehead and chest. Why am I now so
agitated? I do not know. My heart is wounded. Afraid of the people's gossip, I
do not tell anyone.


 


6) The women and girls all
have hard hearts. That is why I do not even go outside. 
Govinda


dasa
 says: Who knows why this girl has become so
changed? I do not know.


 


REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:


This
is sung in Raga Sri.
