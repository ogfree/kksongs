TRANSLATION


1)
Chant, chant "Radha-Krsna!" Everyone chant! When Lord Caitanya and
Lord Nityananda came dancing through Nadia, They gave these teachings: Chant,
chant "Radha-Krsna!" Everyone chant! You are caught up in a whirlpool
of senseless action and are sinking lower and lower. Chant, chant
"Radha-Krsna!" Everyone chant!


 


2)
If you just understand that the spirit soul is the eternal servant of Krsna,
you will never have any more sorrows. Chant Hare Krsna and your eyes will fill
with tears and your body will feel transcendental shivering. Chant, chant
"Radha-Krsna!" Everyone chant!


 


3)
Simply chant "Radha-Krsna" and join with us. Those are the only alms
we beg. Chant, chant "Radha-Krsna!" Everyone chant! "All dangers
will be gone when that Name is chanted," says Bhaktivinoda Thakura. Chant,
chant "Radha-Krsna!" Everyone chant!
