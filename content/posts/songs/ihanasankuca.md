TRANSLATION


(Refrain)
O lotus-eyed one, don't shrink from Me. O resting-place of love, I will
decorate You.


 


1)
Lift the cloth a little from Your breasts and I will draw wonderful pictures of
makara fishes there.


 


2)
Radha, don't move Your cheek. I will draw a very neat picture there.


 


3)
Today Your eternally beautiful form arouses passionate desires in My heart.
