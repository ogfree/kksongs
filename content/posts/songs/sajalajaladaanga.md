TRANSLATION


1)
His charming limbs dark like monsoon clouds were so effulgent I could not even look
upon them. His gently smiling reddish eyes spoke of the desires hidden in His
heart.


 


2)
Who is it I saw today? He was a playful boy under a 
keli-kadamba

tree. My eyes were shy to gaze on His handsome form. I floated in an ocean of
bliss. 


 


3)
He wore a garland of 
bakula
 flowers. A peacock
feather decorated His hair. His reddish eyes were like restless 
kanjana
 birds. I fell into the terrible trap He had
carefully set.


 


4)
Shark-shaped earrings swung to and fro on His glistening-mirror cheeks. 
Kamadeva
 was reflected on His forehead. 
Govinda


dasa
 thinks of Him in this way.
