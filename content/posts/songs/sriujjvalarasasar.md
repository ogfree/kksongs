TRANSLATION


1)

The
 most brilliant mellow of conjugal love has two
natural divisions: 
vipralambha
 (separation) and 
sambhoga
 (enjoyment together). The pleasure felt in union
cannot be properly appreciated without the experience of suffering in
separation. That is the function of 
vipralambha
.


 


2)
There are four types of 
vipralambha
, namely 1) 
purva
-raga (preliminary affection), 2) 
mana

(pouting), 3) 
pravasa
 (distant sojourn), 4) 
prema-vaicittya
 (feeling separation even in the presence of
the lover). The 
purva
-raga is the infatuated
condition that arises prior to union as a result of either seeing or hearing
about the lover.


 


3)

Mana
 arises when one of the attached couple starts pouting
and becomes firmly determined to stay aloof from the other, being averse even
to looking at the other. This particular state of affection has two sides to
it, namely 
sahetu
 
mana

(pouting for a good reason), and 
nirhetu
 
mana
 (pouting for no reason at all). These are standard
twists which commonly occur during the course of transcendental loving affairs.


 


4)

Sahetu
 
mana
 can be pacified
by: 1) 
sama
 (pleasing words
of consolation). 2) 
bheda

(witty remarks), 3) 
kriya
 (worship), 4) 
dana
 (giving presents), 5) 
nati

(falling down at the feet), 6) 
upeksa
 (indifference).
When a pouting festival is created by 
nirhetu
 
mana
, it can be mitigated very quickly by being in a
beautiful place, or by the passing of time, or simply by the sound of
flute-music.


 


5)

Prema-vaicitya
 comes about even in the presence of
the lover by an intense fear of impending separation, thus causing an unusual
transformation of the heart. This is a natural characteristic of pure 
prema
. The symptom known as 
pravasa

comes about when one's beloved has traveled to another forest, town or country.
Thus there are four stages of 
vipralambha

(love-in-separation).
