TRANSLATION


1)
I have earned neither piety nor knowledge. Overwhelmed by sensual pleasures, I
have cheated myself and now see only darkness in all directions.


 


2)
O Lord, are the fountainhead of all mercy. I surrender myself at Your lotus
feet. Kindly show me Your compassion.


 


3)
It is Your promise that one who takes refuge in You will know no dangers or
fear. For a sinner like me there is no other shelter. I beg You now for infinite
grace.


 


4)
O when will I know freedom from desire and thus become Yours? You are eternally
to be served, I am Your eternal servant, and that is the sum of BhaktivinodaÂ’s
devotional mood.
