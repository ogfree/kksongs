TRANSLATION


1)
O 
Hari-nama
! The tips of the toes of 
Your
 lotus feet are constantly being worshiped by the
glowing radiance emanating from the string of gems known as the 
Upanisads
, the crown jewels of all the Vedas. You are
eternally adored by liberated souls, such as 
Narada

and 
Sukadeva
. O 
Hari-nama
!
I take complete shelter of 
You
.


 


2)
O 
Hari-nama
, O name sung by the sages, O
transcendental syllables that bring bliss to the people, even if 
You
 are spoken only once, and even if You are spoken
disrespectfully, You at once remove the many harsh sufferings of everyone.


 


3)
O sun of the Holy Name, even the dim light of 
Your

early dawn '
namabhasa
' devours the power of the
darkness of the material world and gives those who are blind to the truth the
insight to follow the path of pure devotion to 
Krishna
. What learned person in this world can possibly fully describe 
Your
 transcendental glories? 


 


4)
O Holy Name, the Vedas declare that although meditation on impersonal Brahman
cannot bring freedom from past karma, 
Your
 appearance
[on the tongue of your chanter] at once makes all karma disappear.


 


5)
O Holy Name, I pray that my love for You in Your many formsÂ—such as 
Aghadamana
 (Crusher of 
Aghasura
),

Yasodanandana
 (Son of 
Yasoda
),

Nandasunu
 (Son of 
Nanda
), 
Kamalanayana
 (Lotus-eyed), 
Gopicandra

(Moon of the 
gopis
), 
Vrndavanendra

(King of 
Vrndavana
), 
Pranatakaruna

(Merciful to the surrendered souls), and KrishnaÂ—may greatly increase.


 


6)
O Holy Name, You are manifested in two forms: 1. the Supreme Person described
by the Holy 
Name,
 and 2. the sound vibration of the
Holy Name. We know that the second form is even more merciful than the first,
because although a person may commit many offenses to 
Your

first form, he will still plunge into an ocean of bliss by serving Your second
with His voice.


 


7)
O perfect and complete Holy Name of Lord Krishna, You are the embodiment of
delightful and intense spiritual bliss, 
You
 destroy
the many sufferings of those who take shelter of You, and You are a festival of
happiness for 
Gokula
. I bow before 
You

again and again. 


 


8)
O Krishna-
nama
! O inspiration of 
Narada's


vina
! You are full of sweetness, which is like an
ocean full of waves of nectar. If 
You
 wish, please
appear constantly on my tongue, along with transcendental affection for the
Lord.
