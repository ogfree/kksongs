TRANSLATION


1)
Gurudeva! Because you are so merciful, you gave me a place in Godruma amid the woodlands
of Gauda, with this order to fulfill: Â“Dwell here in this Vrndavana and sing
the holy name of Hari.Â”


 


2) But
when, O master, out of your great mercy, will you bestow upon this servant of
yours the spiritual competence to fulfill that order? When will my mind become
tranquil and fixed? When will I endure all hardships and serve Lord Hari
without distractions?


 


3) Due
to attachment to worldly pleasures in childhood and youth, I have developed bad
habits. Because of these sinful acts my body has become an impediment to the
service of the Supreme Lord.


 


4)
Now, in old age, afflicted by the five-fold illnesses, how will I serve the
Lord? O master, please tell me. I have fallen at your feet weeping, overwhelmed
by anxiety.
