TRANSLATION


1) The
Blessed Lord said: I instructed this imperishable science of yoga to the
sun-god, Vivasvan, and Vivasvan instructed it to Manu, the father of mankind,
and Manu in turn instructed it to Iksvaku. 


 


2) This
supreme science was thus received through the chain of disciplic succession,
and the saintly kings understood it in that way. But in course of time the
succession was broken, and therefore the science as it is appears to be lost. 


 


3)
That very ancient science of the relationship with the Supreme is today told by
Me to you because you are My devotee as well as My friend; therefore you can
understand the transcendental mystery of this science. 


 


4)
Arjuna said: The sun-god Vivasvan is senior by birth to You. How am I to
understand that in the beginning You instructed this science to him? 


 


5) The
Blessed Lord said: Many, many births both you and I have passed. I can remember
all of them, but you cannot, O subduer of the enemy! 


 


6)
Although I am unborn and My transcendental body never deteriorates, and
although I am the Lord of all sentient beings, I still appear in every
millennium in My original transcendental form. 


 


7)
Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of
Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion--at that time I descend Myself. 


 


8) In
order to deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to
reestablish the principles of religion, I advent Myself millennium after
millennium. 


 


9) One
who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not,
upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains
My eternal abode, O Arjuna. 


 


10)
Being freed from attachment, fear and anger, being fully absorbed in Me and
taking refuge in Me, many, many persons in the past became purified by
knowledge of Me--and thus they all attained transcendental love for Me. 


 


11)
All of them--as they surrender unto Me--I reward accordingly. Everyone follows
My path in all respects, O son of Prtha. 


 


12)
Men in this world desire success in fruitive activities, and therefore they
worship the demigods. Quickly, of course, men get results from fruitive work in
this world. 


 


13) According
to the three modes of material nature and the work ascribed to them, the four
divisions of human society were created by Me. And, although I am the creator
of this system, you should know that I am yet the non-doer, being unchangeable.



 


14)
There is no work that affects Me; nor do I aspire for the fruits of action. One
who understands this truth about Me also does not become entangled in the
fruitive reactions of work. 


 


15)
All the liberated souls in ancient times acted with this understanding and so
attained liberation. Therefore, as the ancients, you should perform your duty
in this divine consciousness. 


 


16)
Even the intelligent are bewildered in determining what is action and what is inaction.
Now I shall explain to you what action is, knowing which you shall be liberated
from all sins. 


 


17)
The intricacies of action are very hard to understand. Therefore one should
know properly what action is, what forbidden action is, and what inaction is. 


 


18)
One who sees inaction in action, and action in inaction, is intelligent among
men, and he is in the transcendental position, although engaged in all sorts of
activities. 


 


19)
One is understood to be in full knowledge whose every act is devoid of desire
for sense gratification. He is said by sages to be a worker whose fruitive
action is burned up by the fire of perfect knowledge. 


 


20)
Abandoning all attachment to the results of his activities, ever satisfied and
independent, he performs no fruitive action, although engaged in all kinds of
undertakings. 


 


21)
Such a man of understanding acts with mind and intelligence perfectly
controlled, gives up all sense of proprietorship over his possessions and acts
only for the bare necessities of life. Thus working, he is not affected by
sinful reactions. 


 


22) He
who is satisfied with gain which comes of its own accord, who is free from
duality and does not envy, who is steady both in success and failure, is never
entangled, although performing actions. 


 


23)
The work of a man who is unattached to the modes of material nature and who is
fully situated in transcendental knowledge merges entirely into transcendence. 


 


24) A
person who is fully absorbed in Krsna consciousness is sure to attain the spiritual
kingdom because of his full contribution to spiritual activities, in which the
consummation is absolute and that which is offered is of the same spiritual
nature. 


 


25)
Some yogis perfectly worship the demigods by offering different sacrifices to
them, and some of them offer sacrifices in the fire of the Supreme Brahman. 


 


26)
Some of them sacrifice the hearing process and the senses in the fire of the
controlled mind, and others sacrifice the objects of the senses, such as sound,
in the fire of sacrifice. 


 


27)
Those who are interested in self-realization, in terms of mind and sense
control, offer the functions of all the senses, as well as the vital force
[breath], as oblations into the fire of the controlled mind. 


 


28)
There are others who, enlightened by sacrificing their material possessions in
severe austerities, take strict vows and practice the yoga of eightfold
mysticism, and others study the Vedas for the advancement of transcendental
knowledge. 


 


29)
And there are even others who are inclined to the process of breath restraint
to remain in trance, and they practice stopping the movement of the outgoing
breath into the incoming, and incoming breath into the outgoing, and thus at
last remain in trance, stopping all breathing. Some of them, curtailing the
eating process, offer the outgoing breath into itself, as a sacrifice. 


 


30)
All these performers who know the meaning of sacrifice become cleansed of
sinful reaction, and, having tasted the nectar of the remnants of such
sacrifice, they go to the supreme eternal atmosphere. 


 


31) O
best of the Kuru dynasty, without sacrifice one can never live happily on this
planet or in this life: what then of the next? 


 


32) All
these different types of sacrifice are approved by the Vedas, and all of them
are born of different types of work. Knowing them as such, you will become
liberated. 


 


33) O
chastiser of the enemy, the sacrifice of knowledge is greater than the sacrifice
of material possessions. O son of Prtha, after all, the sacrifice of work
culminates in transcendental knowledge. 


 


34)
Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from him
submissively and render service unto him. The self-realized soul can impart
knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth. 


 


35)
And when you have thus learned the truth, you will know that all living beings
are but part of Me--and that they are in Me, and are Mine. 


 


36)
Even if you are considered to be the most sinful of all sinners, when you are
situated in the boat of transcendental knowledge, you will be able to cross
over the ocean of miseries. 


 


37) As
the blazing fire turns firewood to ashes, O Arjuna, so does the fire of knowledge
burn to ashes all reactions to material activities. 


 


38) In
this world, there is nothing so sublime and pure as transcendental knowledge.
Such knowledge is the mature fruit of all mysticism. And one who has achieved
this enjoys the self with himself in due course of time. 


 


39) A
faithful man who is absorbed in transcendental knowledge and who subdues his
senses quickly attains the supreme spiritual peace. 


 


40)
But ignorant and faithless persons who doubt the revealed scriptures do not
attain God consciousness. For the doubting soul there is happiness neither in
this world nor in the next. 


 


41)
Therefore, one who has renounced the fruits of his action, whose doubts are
destroyed by transcendental knowledge, and who is situated firmly in the self,
is not bound by works, O conqueror of riches. 


 


42)
Therefore the doubts which have arisen in your heart out of ignorance should be
slashed by the weapon of knowledge. Armed with yoga, O Bharata, stand and
fight.
