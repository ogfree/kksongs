TRANSLATION


1) Oh, my Lord 
Hari
! Your mind is extremely grave, and 
Your

deep intentions cannot be understood by any other person, although all living
beings are unconsciously following Your mind. The 
opulences

of 
Your
 magnificent potencies produce the creation,
maintenance and ultimate destruction of the material worlds, as well as provide
for liberation from these temporary abodes.


 


2) These pastimes of
creation, maintenance and destruction are all described in the Vedic scripture.
And 
You
 have manifested it all according to Your own
sweet will, in order to fulfill the materialistic desires of certain souls.
When they become averse to 
You
, they then become
drowned in the darkest ignorance within the ocean of 
fruitive

actions and reactions.


 


3) However, if one again
revives his devotional service to 
You
, and worships
You in the association of Your devotees, then he can attain Your lotus feet.
Thus 
Bhaktivinoda's
 mind has been changed back onto
the path towards 
You
 by floating in the mellows of
Your confidential pastimes, which 
maya
 is not able to
touch.
