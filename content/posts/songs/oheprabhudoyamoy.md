TRANSLATION


1)
Oh my Lord, oh most compassionate Personality! Your two divine lotus feet are
beautifully decorating the summit of all the scriptures. And when those lotus
feet in turn decorate the heads of all the spiritual masters coming in the 
disciplic
 succession, then their beauty and splendor
increases hundred fold. Seeing this truth, my heart has become fully satisfied.


 


2)
The desires of all the 
jiva
 souls are actually
following the path which leads them to Your beautiful lotus feet, which are
just purpose-trees as much as they bestow the fulfillment of the most cherished
desires of all these souls. Indeed, 
Your
 feet are just
like the very wealth of the dynasty of 
jivas
, and
they are the most revered object of worship for all of time to come. Thus they
are the ultimate goal and refuge of all souls.


 


3)
The divine lotus feet of the lotus-eyed Lord, are abounding in supreme
spiritual bliss. Sincerely serving those divine feet continuously, 
Bhaktivinoda
 wants to satisfy them by remaining as a humble
follower of the devotees of the Lord.
