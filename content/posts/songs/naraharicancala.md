TRANSLATION


(Refrain) O Lord 
Narhari
 (Lord 
Nrsimhadeva
)! My
mind is uneasy. How should I worship You properly?


 


1) You see me. I see You.
This is how the relationship of love is built. You see me, but my conditioned
eyes cannot see you. This behavior is devoid of sanity. 


 


2) You are all-pervading
ever looking at me. My conditioned eyes are still unable to see You. You own
all merit and transcendental qualities. I own all only faults and sins. I don't
recognize your obligation. 


 


3) How do I remember the puzzle
of understanding and seeing You? O Lord 
Krsna
, You
are full of mercy for Your devotees. All Glories to You, the support of the
universe. 
Rai
 
Dasa
 says
this.
