TRANSLATION


(Refrain)
'Thus the adolescent girl enjoys playing the ho 
ho
 
ho
 
holi
-game."


 


1)
The cymbals, 
sarod
 and 
pakhowaja
-drum
resounded and the 
sakhis
 clapped their hands. 
kunkuma
, sandalwood pulp and 
abira

were densely flying around, being squirted out and showered thickly by the
syringes.


 


2)
Both 
Radha
 and 
Krsna
 played
a beautiful battle and lots of colors fell on both of Them. Both parties
shouted out: "We have won! We have won!", and the 
sakhis

made a lot of noise.


 


3)
Sometimes Their play stagnated because They stared at Each others' faces like
the 
Cakora
-birds staring at the moon. When 
Sivarama
 
das
 a sees this he
slightly smiles out of bliss.
