TRANSLATION


1) 
Balarama

and Beautiful 
Syama
 
Krsna

are moving along holding rods for driving the cows, ropes for binding


them
, canes, and the flute from which issues sweet
notes.


 


2) Krsna calls out, "O
dear 
Sridama
! O 
Sudama
!
Come let us play together on the bank of the daughter of 
Tarani

(the 
Yamuna
). As He walks, Krsna calls out for His
pet cows, "
Dhabali
! 
Syamali
!
Come along."


 


3) Young is His age;
charming is His beauty. His face is a veritable moon, and His complexion is
like that of a dark cloud. He is decorated with a peacock feather on His head
and a necklace of 
gunja
 seeds. His face appears like
that of the god of love.


 


4) Although He is the
essence or the only deity worshipped in the agamas, 
nigamas

and Vedas, He is relishing the pastime of 
hearding

the cows. 
Nasir
 
Mehmood

clings to the hope that He may give him refuge at His lotus feet.
