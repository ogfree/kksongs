TRANSLATION


1)
Before the assembled Kurus and Pandavas, when Duhsasana caught her hair and
clothing,  Krsna (Draupadi), having no other Lord, cried out, "
Govinda, Damodara, Madhava!" 


2)
O Lord Krsna, Visnu, enemy of the Madhu and Kaitabha demons; O Supreme
Personality of Godhead, enemy of Mura, merciful upon the devotees; O Kesava,
Lord of the worlds, Govinda, Damodara, Madhava, please deliver me. 


3)
Though desiring to sell milk, dahi, butter, etc., the mind of a young gopi was
so absorbed in the lotus feet of Krsna that instead of calling out "Milk
for sale," she bewilderedly said, "Govinda!", Damodara!",
and "Madhava!" 

 

4) Their grinding-mortars full of grains, the gopis minds are overcome as they
thresh with their pestles, singing "Govinda, Damodara, Madhava!" 


5)
A lotus-eyed girl instructed the red-beaked pet parrot that was seated in the
cup of her lotus hand; she said, "Govinda, Damodara, Madhava . .
."  


6) In
each and every house, a bevy of gopa-women is engaged in making the caged
parrots constantly utter with broken words, "Govinda,"
"Damodara," and Madhava."


 


7)
With the little boy lying in the swing, all of the gopis used to expertly sing
compositions set to musical notes and rhythm; they went, "Govinda,
Damodara, Madhava," while putting Him to rest. 

  

8) The younger brother of Balarama, playing mischieviously, was dodging about
her with restless eyes. Taking a ball of fresh butter to lure Him over, that
gopi called Him: "O Govinda, Damodara, Madhava . . ."  


9)
O my tongue, since my mouth has become like a lotus by dint of the presence
there of these eloquent, ornamental, delightful syllables, you are like the
swan that plays there. As your foremost pleasure, always articulate the names,
"Govinda," "Damodara," and "Madhava."  


10)
The one and only Lord of Laksmi, in the form of a little cowherd baby, sat on
Mother Yasoda lap drinking her breast-milk. Merged in bliss, she addressed Him
as "Govinda," "Damodara," and "Madhava."  


11)
In Vraja-dhama, Krsna was playing with His playmates, the boys of His age who
protected the animals. With great love, Mother Yasoda called out to her own
son, "O Govinda, Damodara, Madhava!" 


12)
Being firmly tied to the grinding mortar with a cow's rope by Mother Yasoda,
the plunderer of butter softly whimpered. "Govinda, Damodara,
Madhava." 


13)
In His own courtyard, Krsna was carelessly playing with a bracelet. A gopi took
a ball of butter to Him, and shutting His eyes with her palm, she distracted
Him, "O Govinda, Damodara, Madhava . . .(Guess what I have for you!)"



14) In
house after house, groups of gopis gather on various occasions, and together
they always chant the transcendental names of Krsna--"Govinda, Damodara,
and Madhava."


 


15)
His face is pleasing, and the flute pursed at His lips is filled with divine
sound. Amidst the cows, gopas, and gopis, He stands at the base of a coral
tree. Govinda, Damodara, Madhava! 


16)
Rising early during the brahma-muhurta, and remembering the childish activities
of the son of Yasodadevi, the gopis loudly sing while churning
butter--"Govinda, Damodara, Madhava!" 


17)
Having churned and then set aside a fresh lump of butter in the house, Mother
Yasoda was now suspicious--it had been eaten. She said, "Murari! Govinda,
Damodara, Madhava, now tell me the truth!"  


18)
Having finished the worship at home, a young gopi, like a strong current of
love for Krsna, churns butter, and then joins all the gopis and their friends
and they sing, "Govinda, Damodara, Madhava!" 

  

19) One time, early in the morning, just as a girl had put aside her churn in a
pot full of butter--she saw Mukunda. She then began to sing songs in various
ways, about Govinda, Damodara, and Madhava. 


20)
Without having bathed or eaten, Krsna was absorbed in play. Overwhelmed with
affection, mother Yasoda, who thought only of her son's welfare, called out,
"Govinda, Damodara, Madhava! (Come, take your bath and eat
something.)" 


21)
Devarsi Narada and other munis are always surrendered to Lord Visnu, who
happily rests upon His couch. They always chant the names of
"Govinda," "Damodara," and "Madhava," and thus
they attain spiritual forms similar to His.  


22)
Rising at dawn, having performed their rituals and chanted Vedic hymns, the
best of the learned brahmanas always loudly chant, "Govinda, Damodara,
Madhava!" 


23)
In Vrndavana, seeing Sri Radhika overwhelmed with separation from Govinda,
groups of gopas and gopis sang, with tears in their lotus eyes, "Govinda!
Damodara! O Madhava!" 


24)
The cows having already gone out to graze early in the morning, mother Yasoda
gently roused her sleeping son with the palm of her hand, softly saying,
"Govinda, Damodara, Madhava." 


25)
With long, matted hair the color of coral, and bodies purified by eating only
leaves, water, and air, the sages sit beneath the trees and chant,
"Govinda," "Damodara," and "Madhava." 


26)*
After speaking these words, the ladies of Vraja, who were so attached to Krsna,
felt extremely agitated by their imminent separation from Him. They forgot all
worldly shame and loudly cried out, 'O Govinda! O Damodara! O Madhava!'"


 


27)
Sometimes a gopi is engaged in teaching a parrot within a jeweled cage to
recite names like: "Ananda-kanda" (source of bliss),
"Vraja-candra", "Krsna," "Govinda,"
"Damodara," and "Madhava." 


28)
The lotus-eyed Lord was tying the sikha of a cowherd boy to the tail of a calf
when His mother caught Him, lifted up His chin, and said, "Govinda!
Damodara! Madhava!" 


29) In
the early morning a group of His favorite cowherd boys arrived, stick-canes in
hand, to take care of the cows. They addressed the unlimited, primeval
Personality of Godhead, "Govinda, Damodara, Madhava!"


 


30)
When Lord Murari jumped from the Kadamba branch into the water to chastise the
Kaliya serpent, all the gopis and cowherd boys went there and cried out,
"Oh! Govinda! Damodara! Madhava!" 


31)
After Lord Mukunda had met with Akrura and entered Mathura to attend the
ceremony of breaking the bow of Kamsa, all the citizens then shouted,
"Jaya Govinda! Jaya Damodara! Jaya Madhava!" 


32)
When both sons of Vasudeva had actually been taken out of Vrndavana by the
messenger of Kamsa, Yasoda sobbed within the house, crying, "Govinda,
Damodara, Madhava!" 


33)
Hearing how the son of Yasoda, who was but a child, was wrapped within the
coils of the Kaliya serpent at the pond, the cowherd boys cried "Govinda!
Damodara! Madhava!" and scurried down the path.  


34)
Seeing the Lord of the Yadus proceeding towards Mathura upon Akrura's chariot,
the cowherd boys, upon realization of their impending separation, said, "O
Govinda! Damodara, Madhava! (Where are you going? Are You actually leaving us
now?)  


35)
At the edge of a lotus forest, a gopi lay down upon the bed of flowers, bereft
of Krsna. Tears flowed from her lotus eyes as she wept, "Govinda,
Damodara, Madhava." 


36)
Being severely restricted by her mother and father, a lamenting gopi entered
her house, thinking, "Now that I have arrived home, save me, O Lord of the
universe! O Govinda, Damodara, Madhava!" 


37)
Thinking that Krsna was in the forest, a gopi fled into the forest in the
middle of night. But seeing that Krsna wasn't actually there, she became very
fearful, and cried, "Govinda, Damodara, Madhava!" 


38)
Even the ordinary mortals comfortably seated at home who chant the names of
Visnu, "Govinda, Damodara," and "Madhava," certainly attain
(at least) the liberation of having a form similar to that of the
Lord.   


39)
Seeing Srimati Radharani crying from the pangs of separation from Govinda, the
blooming lotus eyes of Radha's girlfriend also filled with tears, and she too
cried, "Govinda, Damodara, Madhava." 


40)
