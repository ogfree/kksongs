TRANSLATION


(Introductory
verse): In the the mind of the body of the tanpura, here is a very unusual
sound. The sound of HariÂ’s name that always plays in the tanpura is indeed no
different from HariÂ’s voice!


 


(Refrain):
In the tanpura of the body plays two notes from its strings: Â“Jaya Sita Rama
Rama! Jaya Radhe Syam Syam!Â”


 


1)
Now, in this temple of the body, the Lord is the eternal ruler. My mind has
been attached to the Lord and broke the journey of birth after birth. The flute
of my mind sings the adorned pitches: Â“Jaya Siya Rama Rama!Â” Â“Jaya Radhe Syam
Syam.Â”


 


2) I
feel so much attachment to the divine sporter that I have awaken to this
radiant jeweled light. I have attained the jewel of RamaÂ’s name and SyamaÂ’s
name of pearl. These two thirsty eyes form a river of tears that sings, Â“Jaya
Siya Rama Rama! Jaya Radhe Syam Syam!Â”
