TRANSLATION


1)
I offer my respectful 
obeisances
 unto His Divine
Grace A. C. 
Bhaktivedanta
 Swami 
Prabhupada
.
Because of his efforts, the eternal, brilliant lamp of 
Navadvipa

(Sri 
Caitanya
 
Mahaprabhu
)
is now destroying the darkness of ignorance within the hearts of the living
entities in this world.


 


2)
I offer my respectful 
obeisances
 unto His Divine
Grace A. C. 
Bhaktivedanta
 Swami 
Prabhupada
.
Being especially ordered by Sri 
Srimad
 
Bhaktisiddhanta
 
Sarasvati
 
Thakura
, and being very merciful, he placed in the Western
countries, where English and other such degraded languages are spoken, 
the
 auspicious treasure house of devotional literature
written by 
Srila
 
Vyasadeva
,

Srila
 
Krsnadasa
 
Kaviraja
, and others.


 


3)
I offer my respectful 
obeisances
 unto His Divine
Grace A. C. 
Bhaktivedanta
 Swami 
Prabhupada
.
Because of his expert logic, the brilliant sun of Lord 
Govinda's

transcendental form is now illuminating this world and completely eclipsing the
insignificant glowworms of the 
impersonalists
.


 


4)
I offer my respectful 
obeisances
 unto His Divine
Grace A. C. 
Bhaktivedanta
 Swami 
Prabhupada
.
Because of his efforts, the pure and crystal-clear 
Ganges
 
River
 of the 
Srimad-Bhagavatam
, the king of 
puranas
, is now flowing all over the world. The pebbles in
that river are the jewels of the pure devotees' prayers, and playing within its
waters are the swans of Lord 
Kesava's
 pastimes.


 


5)
I offer my respectful 
obeisances
 unto His Divine
Grace A. C. 
Bhaktivedanta
 Swami 
Prabhupada
,
who planted the charming lotus feet of Sri 
Sri
 
Radha
 and Krsna in hundreds of temples and thousands of
hearts throughout this world.


 


6)
I offer my respectful 
obeisances
 unto His Divine
Grace A. C. 
Bhaktivedanta
 Swami 
Prabhupada
.
Showering thousands of arrows, which are his books, he has violently destroyed
the fierce army of illusions presented by the Age of Kali.


 


7)
I offer my respectful 
obeisances
 unto His Divine
Grace A. C. 
Bhaktivedanta
 Swami 
Prabhupada
.
Upon this earth he has planted the desire tree of the International Society for
Krishna Consciousness, whose many splendid fruits are the many different
methods of distributing the 
nectarean
 message of Sri 
Caitanya
 
Mahaprabhu
.


 


8)
I offer my respectful 
obeisances
 unto His Divine
Grace A. C. 
Bhaktivedanta
 Swami 
Prabhupada
,
who is like and ocean of mercy, and who has completely taken shelter of Lord
Krsna, the transcendental son of 
Nanda
 Maharaja, with
his body, mind, words, and self. 
Srila
 
Prabhupada
 lives forever by his divine instructions, and
his sincere followers live with him.
