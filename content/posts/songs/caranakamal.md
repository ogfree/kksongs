TRANSLATION


Refrain:
I offer prayer unto the lotus feet of the worshipful Lord Hari.


 


1-2)
By His mercy, a lame person crosses mountains, a blind person sees everything,
a deaf person hears, a dumb person again speaks, and even a poor person walks
with a servant holding an umbrella over his head.


 


3) The
Lord of Sura Dasa is full of compassion. Therefore, I offer my obeisances unto
His lotus feet, again and again.
