TRANSLATION


Refrain: O pleaser of the
senses of 
Radha
! O protector of cows! Your name is
very precious to us!


 


1) You are beautified by a
peacock-feather crown, yellow garments, and multi-colored flower garland. Some
people call 
You
 the son of 
Vasudeva
,
while other call You the song of 
Nanda
 Maharaja.


 


2) You, darling 
Krsna
 
Kanhaiya
, play sweet
melodies on 
Your
 low-pitched 
murali

flute while standing on the bank of the 
Yamuna
 River.
O 
Kanha
, You eat butter and sugar candy sweets in the
company of 
Your
 cowherd boyfriends.


 


3) You drove 
ArjunaÂ’s
 chariot and thus brought about the great battle of
ancient India. When the female saint, Mira 
Bai
,
chanted 
Your
 name and drank the poison sent by her
envious husband to kill her, the poison was turned into nectar.


 


4) When the elephant 
Gajendra
 was trapped by the crocodile in the lake, You
threw Your 
Sudarsana
 
Cakra

into the water to save him. Whenever the devotees [like 
Draupadi
]
are afraid of being naked, then You come running and spread Your cloth to cover
them.


 


5) When 
Ajamila

was approaching his final moment, he remembers to utter Your name. Thus he was
freed from the grasp of the 
Yamadutas
 and dispatched
in the company of the 
Visnudutas
 to Your own
transcendental abode.


 


6) You also fulfilled all
the tasks undertaken by the saint 
Narasi
 Mehta. You
are taking care of all these devotees Â– please do not forget me! May I remain
absorbed birth after birth in Your affection while confidently singing Your
glories.
