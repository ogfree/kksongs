TRANSLATION


1) O Lord 
Krsna
, all glories unto 
You
. As 
You
 stood on 
Akrura's
 chariot You became greatly affected, hearing the
laments of the 
gopis
. 
Nanda

Maharaja and the other cowherd men had climbed up on their carts also to travel
to 
Mathura
.


 


2) O Lord 
Krsna
, burning with the
distress of the impending 
seaparation
 from the 
gopis
, and unable to tolerate the separation of 
Srimati
 
Radharani
, You reassured
the 
gopis
 with sweet and loving words.


 


3) O Lord 
Krsna
, the 
gopis
 appeared to be on the verge of death. Kissing and
embracing them, 
You
 received them and stopped their
great suffering and their crying mixed with exclamations of alas, alas.


 


4) O Lord 
Krsna
, please be merciful to
me. You expertly pacified the 
gopis
 by making various
promises to them. You restored their lives and gave them hope.
