WORD
FOR WORD TRANSLATION: 
Narada
Muni Bajay Vina


 


TRANSLATION


1)
When the great soul Narada Muni plays his vina, the holy name, Radhika-raman,
descends and immediately appears amidst the kirtan of the LordÂ’s devotees.


 


2)
Like a monsoon cloud, the holy name showers nectar in their ears. All the
devotees, due to great ecstasy, repeatedly dance to their hearts content.


 


3)
All the people of the universe become maddened upon entering this intoxicating
shower of nectar. Some people cry, some dance and others become fully
intoxicated within their minds.


 


4)
Lord Siva, embracing Narada Muni, repeatedly makes loud screams of ecstatic
joy, and Lord Brahma, dancing very ecstatically, says, Â“All of you kindly
chant, Haribol! Haribol!Â”


 


5)
In great happiness the thousand-faced Ananta Sesa chants Â“Hari! Hari!Â” By the
influence of the transcendental vibration of the holy name, the whole universe
becomes ecstatically maddened and everyone tastes the mellows of the holy name.


 


6)
Thakura Bhaktivinoda, the humble servant of the Lord, says, Â“The holy name of
Krishna has fulfilled all my desires by vibrating on everyoneÂ’s tongue.Â”
Bhaktivinoda therefore prays at the feet of Sri Rupa Goswami that the chanting
of harinam may continue like this always.
