TRANSLATION


1) The likes of such a
lowly soul as me is not to be found anywhere else in this world. Thus I have
become most agitated due to falling into this vast ocean of material existence.


 


2) Oh 
Yogamaya
!
When will you show mercy to me by lifting up the curtain of illusion with which
you shroud the universe in your external form of 
Mahamaya
?
You are known as 
Kuladevi
, the traditional 
worshipable
 Goddess of all the 
Vaisnavas

dynasties.


 


3) I have heard of your
glories and activities from the Vedic literatures, 
You

take all those souls who are averse to 
Krsna
 and bind
them within the material world.


 


4) To 
that
person whose good fortune gradually dawns and allow
 him to again become
favorably disposed to 
Krsna
, you award him with
liberation and make him free from all grief and fear.


 


5) Oh my dear Mother!
Showing your causeless mercy to your servant 
give
 me a
place in 
Vrndavana
, for you are 
Yogamaya

Herself. 
(The internal energy of yoga, or union.)


 


6) Without complying with
you, no soul at any time can get 
Krsna
, for the
manifestation of 
Krsna's
 pastimes is all enacted only
by your mercy.


 


7) You are the devoted
follower of Lord 
Krsna
, and you are the mother of the
universe. You have shown to me the transcendental touchstone of 
Krsna
 consciousness.


 


8) My dear Mother, I
sincerely wish that you will let my faith in the 
Vaisnavas

increase at every moment.


 


9) Without the lotus feet
of the devotees of the Lord, 
Bhaktivinoda
 is not able
to cross to the other side of this ocean of material existence.
