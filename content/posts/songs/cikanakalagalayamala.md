TRANSLATION


1) His black complexion
glistened. A flower-garland rested on His neck. On His feet anklets jangled.
Flowers adorned His hair. Black bees flew nearby. He glanced at me with crooked
eyes.


 


2) Whom did I see, O 
gopi
-friend, on the 
Yamuna's

banks? It was the cheater 
Krsna
, the rake 
Krsna
. O friend, I had no power to run home. My life's
breath became anxious.


 


3) The moon shone. The
breeze made His peacock-feather in His crown move to and fro. He gently smiled.
He sweetly played on His sweet flute.


 


4) Overcome with sweetness,
He could not stand up. He leaned against a 
keli-kadamba

tree. His sport is to cheat saintly young girls of their very life's breath.


 


5) Shark-shaped earrings
swung on His ears. His garments were yellow. His feet were red lotus flowers. 
Govinda
 
dasa
 worships Him.


 


REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:


This
is to be sung in Raga Sri.
