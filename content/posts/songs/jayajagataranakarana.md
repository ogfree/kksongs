TRANSLATION


(Refrain) Glory to the Lord
who delivers the worlds, the Lord who is the root of all bliss, the Lord who
bears the name 
Nityananda
!


 


1) Tears stream from His
restless lotus eyes. He is restless and unsteady. "Brother 
Abhirama
!Â” He calls. Overcome with ecstatic spiritual love
for Lord 
Gaura
, He has no power to walk.


 


2) His half words spoken in
a choked voice are sweeter than nectar. A gentle smile blossoms on His face. He
breaks all sins into pieces. His glorious arms are decorated with a golden
staff.


 


3) Seeing the moving and unmoving
beings burning with poison, bitten by the fangs of the black snake that is
Kali-
yuga
, He showers everyone with a monsoon of the
nectar-antidote of ecstatic spiritual love. Only 
Govinda


dasa
 does not receive that antidote. Only 
Govinda
 
dasa
 is forgotten.
