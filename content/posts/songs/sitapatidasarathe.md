Master of Hanuman, O friend of Sugriva, Oh older brother of Bharata!

O Lord Who performed the activities of a saintly person wandering in the
Dandaka forest, O Lord Who holds a bow in His hand, O Killer of the demon
Dusana, O Builder of the bridge across the ocean, O shelter of Vibhisana, O
Killer of Ravana, the demonic king of Lanka, O Lord of the Kosala province, all
glories unto You!
