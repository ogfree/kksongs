WORD
FOR WORD TRANSLATION: 
Namamisvaram Saccidananda
Rupam


 


TRANSLATION
       


1)
To the Supreme Lord, whose form is the embodiment of eternal existence, knowledge,
and bliss, whose shark-shaped earrings are swinging to and fro, who is
beautifully shining in the divine realm of Gokula, who I (due to the offense of
breaking the pot of yogurt that His mother was churning into butter and then
stealing the butter that was kept hanging from a swing) is quickly running from
the wooden grinding mortar in fear of mother Yasoda, but who has been caught
from behind by her who ran after Him with greater speed--to that Supreme Lord,
Sri Damodara, I offer my humble obeisances. 


 


2)
(Seeing the whipping stick in His mother's hand) He is crying and rubbing His
eyes again and again with His two lotus hands. His eyes are filled with fear,
and the necklace of pearls around His neck, which is marked with three lines
like a conch shell, is shaking because of His quick breathing due to crying. To
this Supreme Lord, Sri Damodara, whose belly is bound not with ropes but with
His mother's pure love, I offer my humble obeisances. 


 


3)
By such childhood pastimes as this He is drowning the inhabitants of Gokula in
pools of ecstasy, and is revealing to those devotees who are absorbed in
knowledge of His supreme majesty and opulence that He is only conquered by
devotees whose pure love is imbues with intimacy and is free from all conceptions
of awe and reverence. With great love I again offer my obeisances to Lord
Damodara hundreds and hundreds of times. 


 


4)
O Lord, although You are able to give all kinds of benedictions, I do not pray
to You for the boon of impersonal liberation, nor the highest liberation of
eternal life in Vaikuntha, nor any other boon (which may be obtained by
executing the nine processes of bhakti). O Lord, I simply wish that this form
of Yours as Bala Gopala in Vrndavana may ever be manifest in my heart, for what
is the use to me of any other boon besides this? 


 


5)
O Lord, Your lotus face, which is encircled by locks of soft black hair tinged
with red, is kissed again and again by mother Yasoda, and Your lips are reddish
like the bimba fruit. May this beautiful vision of Your lotus face be ever
manifest in my heart. Thousands and thousands of other benedictions are of no
use to me. 


 


6)
O Supreme Godhead, I offer my obeisances unto You. 
O Damodara! O Ananta! O Vishnu!

O master! O my
Lord, be pleased upon me. By showering Your glance of mercy upon me, deliver
this poor ignorant fool who is immersed in an ocean of worldly sorrows, and
become visible to my eyes. 


 


7)
O Lord Damodara, just as the two sons of Kuvera, Manigriva and Nalakuvara, were
delivered from the curse of Narada and made into great devotees by You in Your
form as a baby tied with rope to a wooden grinding mortar, in the same way,
please give to me Your own prema-bhakti. I only long for this and have no
desire for any kind of liberation. 


 


8)
O Lord Damodara, I first of all offer my obeisances to the brilliantly
effulgent rope which binds Your belly. I then offer my obeisances to Your
belly, which is the abode of the entire universe. I humbly bow down to Your
most beloved Srimati Radharani, and I offer all obeisances to You, the Supreme
Lord, who displays unlimited pastimes.
