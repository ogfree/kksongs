TRANSLATION


1) O
my dear mind! May you become a transcendentally maddened Baul while remaining
at home! Why do you engage in wicked activities? 


 


2) You
may keep the mood of a Baul within your mind, and giving up improper
association you will automatically obtain sense pleasures in accordance with
religious principles. Thus you will pass your life while every moment
experiencing the bliss of Hari-nama. 


 


3) One
who renounces his home while his heart is not yet purified is called a
markata-vairagi ("monkey-like renunciant"). By the heart being full
of offenses, acting under the control of the enemy, one sinks lower and lower
at every step. 


 


4) A
renunciant immature in renunciation is one who swindles the wives of others and
thus remains just like a fat monkey in charge of a harem of female monkeys. 


Furthermore,
such a person goes from door to door out of greed to receive monetary
donations. Thus he engages in the so-called worship of even fallen and degraded
souls. 


 


5) May
your own mind become ripened with maturity while remaining at home. And just
perform Hari-nama sankirtan each and every day. Then, in Cand Baul's company,
you shall utterly renounce the material world.
