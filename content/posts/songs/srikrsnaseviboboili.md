TRANSLATION


1)

Ahisarika
: Only for the sake of rendering service to 
Krsna
 for His pleasure, the 
sahkis

who are to meet their lover at the assigned rendezvous garden abandon their
homes and proceed on the path to the pleasure grove. 2) 
Basaka-sajja
:
Then they beautify the 
kunja
 with various types of
decorations, busying themselves in the mood of preparing the bed-chamber for
their 
dearmost
 lover. 3) 
Utkanthita
:
And in the process, they all repeatedly glance out the doorway, looking down
the road in greatly exhilarating eagerness, anticipating the arrival of their
beloved hero, Sri 
Krsna
.


 


2)
4) 
Khandita
: When 
Krsna

arrives late, transgressing the fixed time of rendezvous, His body bears some
of signs of His having enjoyed Himself with another lover. At that time, the
heroine becomes extremely jealous upon observing such symptoms. 5) 
Bipralabdha
: When the heroine sits waiting in the solitary
bower, and her lover does not show up at all, then She feels disappointed and
let down by His absence.


 


3)
6) 
Kalahantarita
: Whenever, due to some quarrel with 
Krsna
, 
Radharani
 sends Him away
in Her anguish, then She become severely afflicted with bereavement due to
dismissing Him. 7) 
Prosita-bhartrka
: When 
Krsna
 leaves 
Vrndavana
 and goes
to 
Mathura
, not returning even after many days have
passed
,
 then 
Srimati
 
Radharani
 becomes most miserable and suffers terribly in
separation while Her lover is abroad.


 


4)
8) 
Svadhina-bhartrka
: When the heroine dominates Her
lover, and tames Him according to Her own whims, then such a lady uses Him for
Her own amorous sports. All heroines experience these eight different states of
devotional service. Thus they taste different varieties of separation and
meeting.
