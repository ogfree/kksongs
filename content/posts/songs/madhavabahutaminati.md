TRANSLATION


1) O 
Madhava
,
with this offering of a 
tulasi
 leaf and sesame seeds
I beseech You and pledge my body in Your service. I know Your compassion is
such that You will not reject me. 


 


2) While considering this
appeal, You will only be able to count my faults. You will not find even a
trace of good qualities in me. You are known throughout the creation as 
Jagannatha
 (master of the universe). Therefore do I, a
worthless soul living within this universe, not have the right to accept You as
my master?


 


3) Birth after birth, as a
result of my karma, I repeatedly come and go, sometimes as a human, sometimes
as an animal and sometimes as a bird, worm or insect. But in whatever birth I
take may my mind always remain fixed on Your narrations.


 


4) With great remorse, the
poet 
Vidyapati
 humbly prays, Â“O 
Madhava
,
O friend of the fallen, please give this insignificant person shelter at the
tender leaf of Your lotus feet. In this way, I may cross over this ocean of
material existence.Â”
