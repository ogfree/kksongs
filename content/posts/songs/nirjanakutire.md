TRANSLATION


1)
In my solitary cottage, I will constantly remain absorbed in the remembrance of
Sri 
Radha's
 lotus feet. By and by, I will see Sri 
Rupa
 
Manjari
 slowly approaching.
Coming up to me, she will then begin saying some very nice things to me.


 


2)
She will say, "Oh 
sakhi
! My dear friend, what
are you doing sitting here? Just come outside here and look --- just see 
Who
 is coming! The Divine Couple will now perform 
Their
 splendors, unparalleled transcendental meeting, and
today you will be one of the maidservants at Their lotus feet!"


 


3)
The perfections of their personal mellows which are individually exhibited by
each of the 
gopis
 of 
Vraja

are all the real treasures of 
Vrndavana
, and these
individual moods are intelligently fickle and chaste. The so-called meditations
of the yogis, or the impersonal speculations of the 
Brahmavadis

cannot get any foothold within the realm of such transcendental mellows as those
which are naturally exhibited by the 
gopis
.


 


4)
Seeing 
Them
 personally coming and performing Their 
midday
 pastimes there at 
Radha-kunda
,
I have become very much desirous to serve the lotus feet of Sri 
Radha
. And whenever I get the opportunity to render some
small service, I will perform that service with the greatest care and
attention, and I will thus become rich with the treasure of 
Her

lotus feet.
