TRANSLATION


1)
Look! Now that you have filled your eyes, what further questions do you have?
In 
Nadiya-nagara
, in 
Saci's

house, in the daytime a moon shines.


 


2)
Gold purified how many thousands of times 
shines
 as 
Gaura's
 fair body? From the monsoon-cloud of 
Saci's
 womb has come a stationary lightning-flash.


 


3)
How many glorious moons shine as 
Gaura's
 face? Even
at night they fill all the directions with light. Yearning to gather nectar,
the black bees of His eyes fly to the lotus flowers of His ears.


 


4)
His graceful arms reach to His knees. His navel is a gold lake. His waist is a
lion's waist. His thighs are golden mountains. He charms 
Locana


dasa's
 heart.


 


REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:


This
could either be sung in Raga 
Vibhasa
 or Raga 
Todi
.
