TRANSLATION


(Refrain)
The spring season, 
basanti
,
is spread throughout the forests


 


1) 
The peacock feather in 
SyamaÂ’s
 crown is 
basanti
 
and
the garland of forest flowers around His neck is 
basanti
. 
Syama

is smiling gently, and 
basanti
 
is spread throughout the forests.


 


2) 
All the 
sakhis
 
who are present there cannot resist
falling in love with Him. Their eyes are riveted on Him, and 
basanti
 
is spread throughout the forests.


 


3) 
The 
kunjas
 
are decorated with 
basanti
. 
The cuckooÂ’s sounds are 
basanti
. 
Syama

sweetly plays the flute, and 
basanti
 
is spread throughout the forests.
