TRANSLATION


1) Oh my Lord 
Hari
! I have been a great offender to You, and thus I am
just quite fit to receive punishment for all of my misdeeds. I am sinister and
ill-fated, and I am guilty of committing thousands upon thousands of sins. I
have somehow fallen into the very belly of the terribly deep, dark, fearsome
and horrible ocean of material existence, and I have no shelter at all in this
hellish place. Therefore I am greatly desirous of finding some way to get
salvation from this dreadful predicament.


 


2) 
Hari
!
Thus I have taken refuge at Your two lotus feet out of intense fear, Please be
kind to me and make me Your own property. Your promise is that for whoever
takes full shelter of You, then You will become his protector and maintainer,
Oh Lord.


 


3) Completely relaying on
Your promise, this servant has now taken full shelter of You as his last hope,
oh 
Madhava
! Oh Lord of my life! 
Bhaktivinoda

sings this prayer to You now just to be eternally fixed up in the service of
Your two reddish lotus feet.
