TRANSLATION


1) O Lord Krsna, On a pleasant
night You performed pastimes accompanied by Lord Balarama, and surrounded by
the gopis who were enthralled by Your enchanting songs.


 


2) O Lord Krsna, when they
were frightened of the demon Sankhacuda and called out to You for help, You
immediately chased after the demon. Leaving the gopis under the protection of
Lord Balarama, You (followed the demon) and struck him on the head, killing
him.


 


3) O Lord Krsna, You took
the jewel from the crown of the Sankhacuda demon and presented it to Your
pleased brother Balarama. O killer of the enemy of the gopis, I offer
respectful obeisances unto You.
