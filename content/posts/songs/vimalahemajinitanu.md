LYRICS:


(1)


vimala hema jini tanu anupāma re


tāhe śobhe nānā phula-dāma


kadamba keśara jini ekati pulaka re


tara mājhe bindu bindu ghāma


 


(2)


calite nā pāre gorā- cānda gosāÃ±i re


balite nā pāre ādha bola


bhāve avaśa ha-iyā hari hari bolāiyā


ācaṇḍāle dhari dei kola


 


(3)


gamana manthara-gati jini maya-matta hātī


bhāvāveśe ḍhuli ḍhuli jāya


aruṇa vasana-chabi jini prabhātera ravi


gorā ańge laharī khelāya


 


(4)


e hena sampada kāle gorā nā bhajiluÃ± hele


tuyā pade nā kariluÃ± āśa


śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya ṭhākura
śrī-nityānanda


guṇa gāya vṛndāvana dāsa


 


TRANSLATION


1) His peerless form defeats the purest gold and is decorated with a
wealth of many kinds of flowers. The hairs on that form, standing erect and
interspersed with drops of perspiration, defeat the beauty of the filaments of
the kadamba flower.


 


2) That Lord Gauracanda has lost the power to walk properly. He is even
unable to speak more than half words. Overcome with ecstatic love and chanting,
Â“Hari! Hari!Â” He embraces everyone, down to the lowly candala, in His arms.


 


3) Overcome with ecstatic love, His staggering gait defeats the walking of
intoxicated elephants. Clothed in saffron garments surpassing the beauty of the
rising sun, the movement of His golden limbs resembles the dancing of waves.


 


4) Alas! At that blissfully fortunate time I did not worship Gaura. I
did not yearn to attain His feet. Lamenting in this way, Vrndavan Das sings the
glories of Sri Krsna Caitanya and Thakur Sri Nityananda.
