TRANSLATION


Refrain:
Glory, glory to Lord 
Gauracandra
, the destroyer of
sins, the purifier of the fallen, the savior of the worlds, the Lord who
revealed the 
sankirtana
 movement of chanting the holy
names!


 


1) The circle of His face
is a blossoming golden lotus. His eyes are restless 
khanjana

birds. His broad forehead is anointed with the 
tilaka

that is Lord 
Hari's
 temple. He carries a water pot. A

kaupina
 is tied about His waist.


 


2)
His glorious arms reach to His knees. A 
malati

garland swings to and fro from His neck. His tall form enchants the world's
hearts. Like 
kadamba
 filaments, the hairs of His body
stand erect in ecstasy.


 


3)
The blossoming flowers of the soles of His feet are red like the rising sun. He
is not different from 
Advaita
 and 
Nityananda
.
The nectar at the lotus flowers of His feet makes 
Vijayananda


dasa
 float in an ocean of bliss.


 


REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:


This
is to be sung in Raga 
Mangala
.
