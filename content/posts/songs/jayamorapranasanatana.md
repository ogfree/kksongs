TRANSLATION


(Refrain) Glory to 
Srila
 
Rupa
 
Goswami

and 
Srila
 
Sanatana
 
Goswami
! They are my breath of life. The two brothers are
the shelter of those with no other refuge. They are the 
yupa

(central pole in a sacrificial arena) in the 
yajna
 of

bhakti
-yoga.


 


1) They are 
VrindavanaÂ’s
 well filled with the sweet nectar of pure
spiritual love. They are the ocean of mercy and the friends of those lost souls
who have no master. In the assembly of devotees they are the kings.


 


2) They are the great
generals leading the army of preachers who expertly speak on 
bhakti
 and the 
Bhagavatam
. Their
pure glories are known throughout the fourteen worlds, and are nectar for the
tongue.


 


3) The dust of their lotus
feet has become the 
Vaisnavas
Â’ fragrant 
tilaka
. Having deep reverence for 
Srila


Vyasadeva
, they always worship Sri 
RadhaÂ’s
 peerless lotus feet.


 


(Refrain 2) Glory to 
Srila
 
Rupa
 
Goswami

and 
Srila
 
Sanatana
 
Goswami
! They are the crest-jewels of saintly devotees.
They are filled with the nectar of devotional love for Sri 
Sri


Radha
 
and .


 


4) Tasting the sweetness of
residing in 
Vrndavan
, they are filled with bliss and
their bodily hairs stand up. Renouncing everything, they worship 
VrajaÂ’s
 forest groves. Day and night they meditate on 
RadhaÂ’s
 love for 
Krishna
.


 


5) These two brothers
brought the mercy of Sri Krsna 
Caitanya
, who is an
ocean of com-passion. Without these two brothers I am help-less and without a
master. Without these two brothers, the tree of my happiness has broken and
fallen to the ground.
