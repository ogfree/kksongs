TRANSLATION

1) Sometimes in great happiness Lord Jagannatha makes a loud concert with His
flute in the groves on the banks of the Yamuna. He is like a bumblebee tasting
the beautiful lotus like faces of the cowherd damsels of Vraja, and great
personalities such as Laksmi, Siva, Brahma, Indra, and Ganesa worship His lotus
feet. May that Jagannatha Svami be the object of my vision.


 


2) In
His left hand Lord Jagannatha holds a flute, on His head He wears peacock
feathers, and on His hips He wears fine yellow silken cloth. From the corners
of His eyes He bestows sidelong glances upon His loving devotees, and He always
reveals Himself through His pastimes in His divine abode of Vrndavana. May that
Jagannatha Svami be the object of my vision.


 


3) On
the shore of the great ocean, within a large palace atop the brilliant, golden
Nilacala Hill, Lord Jagannatha resides with His powerful brother Balabhadra and
His sister Subhadra, who sits between Them. May that Jagannatha Svami, who
bestows the opportunity for devotional service upon all godly souls, be the
object of my vision.


 


4)
Lord Jagannatha is an ocean of mercy and as beautiful as a row of blackish rain
clouds. He is the storehouse of bliss for Laksmi and Sarasvati, and His face
resembles a spotless full-blown lotus. The best of demigods and sages worship
Him, and the Upanisads sing His glories. May that Jagannatha Svami be the
object of my vision.


 


5)
When Lord Jagannatha moves along the road on His Rathayatra car, at every step
large assemblies of brahmanas loudly chant prayers and sing songs for His
pleasure. Hearing their hymns, Lord Jagannatha becomes very favorably disposed
toward them. He is the ocean of mercy and the true friend of all the worlds.
May that Jagannatha Svami, along with His consort Laksmi, who was born from the
ocean of nectar, be the object of my vision.


 


6)
Lord Jagannatha, whose eyes resemble full-blown lotus petals, is the ornament
on Lord BrahmaÂ’s head. He resides on Nilacala Hill with His lotus feet placed
on the heads of Anantadeva. Overwhelmed by the mellows of love, He joyfully embraces
Srimati RadharaniÂ’s body, which is like a cool pond. May that Jagannatha Svami
be the object of my vision.


 


7) I
do not pray for a kingdom nor do I pray for gold, rubies, or wealth. I do not
ask for a beautiful wife as desired by all men. I simply pray that Jagannatha
Svami, whose glories Lord Siva always sings, may be the constant object of my
vision.


 


8) O
Lord of the demigods, please quickly remove this useless material existence I
am undergoing. O Lord of the Yadus, please destroy this vast, shoreless ocean
of sins. Alas, this is certain Lord Jagannatha bestows His lotus feet upon
those who feel themselves fallen and have no shelter in this world but Him. May
that Jagannatha Svami be the object of my vision.



9) The self-retrained, virtuous soul who recites these eight verses glorifying
Lord Jagannatha becomes cleansed of all sins and duly proceeds to Lord VisnuÂ’s
abode.
