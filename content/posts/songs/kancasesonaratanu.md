TRANSLATION


1)
His youthful golden form staggers in ecstasy. His moonlike face smiles with
waves of nectar.


 


2)
His forest garland reaches to the ground. His sweet fragrance attracts swarms
of bees.


 


3)
In one set of hands He holds a bow and sharp arrows. Seeing them, His enemies
tremble in fear.


 


4)
These arms are dark like 
durva
 grass. They have
ornaments of claws. His jewel bracelets and anklets glisten.


 


5)
Below these is another pair of arms. These arms are dark like monsoon clouds. In
these hands He plays peerless charming melodies on the flute.


 


6)
These nails defeat a host of jewel moons. Decorated with jewel ornaments, they
make 
Kamadeva
 faint in ecstasy.


 


7)
Below these is another pair of arms. In these hands He holds a 
danda
 and 
kamandalu
. Into pieces
these arms break Kali-
yugaÂ’s
 sins and offenses.


 


8)
A necklace of jewels and pearls sways to and fro on the mountain of His chest.
A 
Kaustubha
 jewel sways to and fro on His chest
marked with 
Srivatsa
.


 


9)
His sandal-paste-anointed arms rest at the edge of His chest. His navel is
deep. His waist is slender like a lionÂ’s waist.


 


10)
His garments reach to reddish feet. 
Ananta
 
dasa
 worships the nails on His toes.
