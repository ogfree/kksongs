parama
karuṇa, pahū dui jana

nitāi gauracandra

saba avatāra-sāra śiromaṇi

kevala ānanda-kanda

bhajo
bhajo bhāi, caitanya nitāi

sudṛḍha biśwāsa kori

viṣaya chāḍiyā, se rase majiyā,

mukhe bolo hari hari

dekho
ore bhāi, tri-bhuvane nāi,

majiyā, rohili poriyā,

se pade nahilo āśa

āpana karama, bhuÃ±jāye śamana,

kahoye locana-dāsa


 


WORD
FOR WORD TRANSLATION: 
Parama
Karuna


 


TRANSLATION


1)
The two Lords, Nitai-Gauracandra, are very merciful. They are the essence of
all incarnations. The specific significance of these incarnations is that They
introduced a process of chanting and dancing that is simply joyful.


 


2)
My dear brother, I request that you just worship Lord Caitanya and Nityananda
with firm conviction and faith. If one wants to be Krsna conscious by this
process, one has to give up his engagement in sense gratification. One simply
has to chant, "Hare Krsna! Hari Hari!" without any motive.


 


3)
My dear brother, just try and examine this. Within the three worlds there is no
one like Lord Caitanya or Lord Nityananda. Their merciful qualities are so
great that upon hearing Them even birds and beasts cry and stones melt.


 


4)
But Locana dasa regrets that I am entrapped by sense gratification. Since I
have no attraction for the lotus feet of Lord Caitanya and Lord Nityananda,
then Yamaraja, the superintendent of death, is punishing me by not allowing me
to be attracted by this movement.
