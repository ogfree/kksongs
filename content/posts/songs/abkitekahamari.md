TRANSLATION


(Refrain):
Please listen to my humble prayer. Please protect me, Oh lifter of Govardhana
Hill! Oh Giridhari!


 


1) Just
as You protected Arjuna, during the Mahabharata war. You were the charioteer of
Arjuna, Oh beholder of the Sudarsana Cakra! You truly honored Your devotees.


 


2) Just
as You protected Draupadi when she was helpless. You defeated by Duhsasana, by
supplying Draupadi a long chain of clothes. His two arms got tired and he
became unconscious by MurariÂ’s power.


 


3)
Please protect Sura Dasa, Oh protector of devotees. You are the lover of the
beloved of Srimati Radharani, the beloved daughter of King Vrsabhanu. I have
come to take shelter of You.


 


Remarks/ Extra Information
: 


This can
be sung in Raga Misra Kafi in either Bhajani or Dipchandi Tala.


 


This
song was popularized by Dilraj KaurÂ’s ISKCON recording Â“Prabhu Vandana.Â”
