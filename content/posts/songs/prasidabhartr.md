TRANSLATION


1) O Lord 
Krsna
, please be merciful
unto me. When some of the 
gopis
 were forcibly
prevented from going to 
You
 by their husbands, those 
gopis
 acutely burned in the great fire of pure love for
You. Maddened with their great desire to attain 
You
,
those 
gopis
 became free from the bonds of material
corporal existence.


 


2) O Lord 
Krsna
, when 
Sukudeva
 
Gosvami
 heard King 
Pariksit's
 question, the sage became angry and chastised
his student, explaining that 
You
 are a great a ocean
of transcendental glorious qualities. 
Sukadeva

explained that remembrance of 
You
, even if performed
with anger, grants great spiritual benefit. O Lord, please remember me.


 


REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:


Based on Verse 2, the question King 
Pariksit

asked was: "The 
gopis
 did not know that 
Krsna
 is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They accepted
Him as a beautiful boy, and considered Him to be their paramour. So how was it
possible for them to get freed from the material condition just by thinking of
a paramour?"
