TRANSLATION


1)
Sri Narada said: O master of Indra and the demigods, O master of the universe,
O dear father, please tell me the kavaca of Lord Visnu-Nrsimha. By reciting
that kavaca a wise man conquers the three worlds.


 


2)
Sri Brahma said: O Narada wealthy in austerity, O best of my sons, please
listen and I will tell you the Nrsimha-kavaca called Trailokya-vijaya (the
conquest of the three worlds).


 


3)
By reciting this prayer one becomes eloquent. One becomes a conqueror of the
three worlds. My son, I became the creator of this universe because I recited
this kavaca and wore it in an amulet.


 


4)
By reciting this prayer and wearing it in an amulet Goddess Laksmi became the
protector of the three worlds, Lord Siva became the destroyer, and the demigods
became the masters of the directions.


 


5)
Now I will speak this kavaca, which contains within it all the mantras of the
Vedas. By the mercy of this kavaca Durvasa Muni conquered the three worlds. By
reciting this prayer and wearing it in an amulet he became able to punish
others, he became feared for his anger.


 


6)
The sage of this kavaca is Prajapati Brahma. The meter is Gayatri. The Deity is
Lord Nrsimha, the all-powerful Personality of Godhead.


 


7-8B)
Ksraum. May this great mantra, its syllables glittering like a string of moons,
protect my head. I bow down before all-powerful, frightening, auspicious,
sublimely ferocious Lord Nrsimha, who is the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Lord Visnu, who burns like fire, whose faces are everywhere, and who is the
death of death. This thirty-two syllable prayer is the king of mantras, the
sura-druma tree of mantras.


 


9)
May the word "ksraum" protect my neck. May the word "bhagavate"
(to the Supreme Personality of Godhead) protect my heart. May the word
"narasimhaya" (to Lord Nrsimha) protect my eyes. May the word
"jvala-maline" (who wears a garland of flames) protect my head.


 


10)
May the words "dipta-damstraya" (whose teeth glisten),
"agni-netraya" (whose eyes are fires), Â“sarva-rakso-ghnaya" (the
killer of all raksasas), and Â“sarva-bhuta-vinasanaya" (the killer of all
ghosts) protect my nose.


 


11)
May the words "sarva-jvara-vinasaya" (the protector from all fevers),
"daha daha" (burn!burn!) "paca paca" (burn! burn!)
"raksa raksa" (protect! protect!) "svaha" and the entire
mantra protect my face.*


 


12)
Om Namo Ramacandraya (Obeisances to Lord Ramacandra). May Lord Ramacandra
protect my private parts. May Lord Ramacandra protect my hands. Om Namo
Narayanaya. (Obeisances to Lord Narayana). May Lord Narayana protect my feet.
May Lord Narayana protect my sides. Am hrim kraum ksraum ca hum phat.


 


13)
Om Namo Bhagavate (Obeisances to the Supreme Personality of Godhead). May Lord
Bhagavan protect my feet. May Lord Bhagavan protect my waist and hips. Om Namo
Vasudevaya (Obeisances to Lord Vasudeva). May Lord Vasudeva protect my back.
Klim Krsnaya (Obeisances to Lord Krsna). May Lord Krsna protect my thighs.


 


14)
Klim Krsnaya (Obeisances to Lord Krsna). May Lord Krsna always protect my
knees. This is the best of mantras. Klim Glaum Klim Syamalangaya Namah
(Obeisances to darklimbed Lord Krsna). May Lord Krsna protect my feet.


 


15)
Ksraum Narasimhaya Ksraum. (Obeisances to Lord Nrsimha). May Lord Nrsimha
always protect all the limbs and parts of my body.


 


16)
My child, I have thus spoken to you the personification of all mantras. Out of
affection I told it to you, but it should not be repeated to anyone.


 


17)
After worshiping his spiritual master, one should accept this kavaca. Then one
attains all piety. Then one attains all perfection.


 


18)
Performing purascarya and yajnas a hundred and eight times is equal to one
tenth the merit attained by chanting this kavaca.


 


19)
One who properly chants this kavaca becomes saintly. Forgetting their natural
rivalry, Laksmi and Sarasvati both reside in his home.


 


20)
Offering eight palmsful of flowers and only once chanting this mula-mantra, one
attains the result of a thousand years of worship.


 


21)
If one writes this mantra on birch and wears in an amulet around one's neck or
on one's right arm, then Lord Nrsimha will personally accompany him.


 


22)
A woman should wear this amulet on her left arm. A man should wear it on his
right hand. Whoever wears this sacred amulet attains all perfections.


 


23)
By wearing this amulet a woman who is barren, who has only one child, whose
children have died, or whose children are lost will become of the mother of
many good children.


 


24)
By the mercy of this kavaca one becomes liberated even while living in this
world. One shakes the three worlds. One conquers the three worlds.


 


25)
The moment they see him, bhūtas, pretas, pisacas, raksasas, and danavas flee
far away. They run to another country.


 


26)
These evil spirits flee far away from any home or village where this kavaca is
placed.


 


REMARKS/EXTRA
INFORMATION:


The
mantra referred to in Verse 11 is: 


 


Â“kṣrauḿ
bhagavate narasiḿhāya jvālā-māline dīpta-daḿṣṭrāya
agni-netrāya sarva-rakṣoghnāya


sarva-bhūta-vināśanāya
sarva-jvara-vināśāya daha daha paca paca rakṣa rakṣa
svāhā"


 


"I
bow down before Lord Nrsimha, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who wears a
garland of flames, whose teeth glisten, whose eyes are fires, who is the killer
of all raksasa and ghosts, and who is the protector from all fevers. O Lord
Nrsimha, please burn my enemies! Burn them! Burn them! Burn Them! Protect me!
Protect me! Svaha!"
