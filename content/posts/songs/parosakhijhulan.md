TRANSLATION


1)
Some thing very special happened today! Instead of enjoying the Swing Lila, the
Divine Couple entered into a unique Love Quarrel!! The eternal associates, 
Sakhis
 and the dedicated 
gopis

have arranged the beautiful swing made of sandalwood and studded with precious
diamonds, hung from the blooming fragrant 
Kadamba

tree on the sandy bank of 
Yamuna
 
River
, in a charming bower for the swinging pleasure of the Divine Couple.


 


2)

Lalita
 
Sakhi
 has made a
cordial request, "O dear Sweethearts! We invite Our precious Lordships to
enjoy the pastime of swing 
lila
 showering Divine joy
on all the blessed souls!" Then the naughty, quarrelsome Young Boy, Sri
Krishna said with a smile, "Let My Fair Girl sit alone on the swing today.
I feel like doing My '
seva
' (loving service) of
pushing gently while Her Highness is seated Herself upon the blessed swing! If
not, I am standing right here firmly!! I am not going to move at all from here
nor joining Her in the playful swinging!"


 


3)
Hearing His words, the tender Sweet Girl, 
Radharani

arrogantly replies with pride and distaste, "Let the mischievous Boy be
seated alone on the swing today! I have no desire to accompany Him. I, too,
long to enjoy rocking My Lord slowly on the swing in gentle movements!!"
Her words are full of feigned anger and Her decision seems to be final. All the

Sakhis
 and playmates are very much disappointed as
their Lordships have entered into this love quarrel and Both of Them decided
not to swing together, unless Their demand is met. 
Krpalu


Dasa
 then prays to Lord Beloved, 
Hari
,
"O my precious Divine Beloved! Why have you resorted to this unwelcome
decision today? I am fully aware of Your heart-felt desire to serve Your Soul
selflessly. Please also consider the yearning of Your surrendered souls to be
engaged in Your Loving service. Graciously reconcile with Your Mistress and let
us all enjoy the celebration of Your playful pastime of Swing Lila to our
hearts' content! Come on, kindly be seated upon the swing so that we can gently
push Both of You together!"
