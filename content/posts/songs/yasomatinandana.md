WORD
FOR WORD TRANSLATION: 
Yasomati Nandana


 


TRANSLATION       



1)
Lord Krsna is the beloved son of mother Yasoda; the transcendental lover in the
land of Vraja; the delight of Gokula; Kana [a nickname of Krsna]; the wealth of
the lives of the gopis. He steals the mind of even Cupid and punishes the
Kaliya serpent.


 


2)
These pure, holy names of Lord Hari are full of sweet, nectarean pastimes.
Krsna is the Lord of the twelve forests of Vraja, He is ever-youthful and is
the best of lovers. He is always playing on a flute, and He is an excellent
dresser.


 


3)
Krsna is the protector of the inhabitants of Vraja; the destroyer of various
demoniac dynasties; the keeper and tender of Nanda Maharaja's cows; the giver
of pleasure to the cows, land, and spiritual senses; the husband of the goddess
of fortune; the butter thief; and the beautiful cowherd boy of Nanda Maharaja.


 


4)
Krsna wanders along the banks of the River Yamuna. He stole the garments of the
young damsels of Vraja who were bathing there. He delights in the mellows of
the rasa dance; He is very merciful; the lover and beloved of Srimati
Radharani; the great dancer of Vrndavana; and the shelter and only refuge of
Thakura Bhaktivinoda.
