LYRICS:


(1)


udita sūrya
prāci rāje,


dwija-maṇi
gorā aise jāge,


bhagata-vṛnda
sańge lie,


nagara-śobhā
sāje


 


(2)


'tāthaī
tāthaī bāje mṛdańga,


ghana ghana
ghana sańga sańga,


prema se
dama ke svarṇa ańga,


caraṇa
nūpura bāje


 


(3)


mukunda mādhava
yādava hari,

boliye boliye prema se bhari,

vṛddhā gayi yeh niśā gelā 


divasa
śarīra-sāje


 


(4)


aise durlabha
mānava-deha,

pākara kariye jatana deha,

yadi nā bhajiyā yaśodā-lāla,

paḍiye carama lāje


 


(5)


udita sūrya hove
asta,

divasa vyārtha kare byasta,

taba bhī kāhe ālasa hoke,

bhajana hṛdoya-rāje

dharo-vividha vipada-bhār,

nāma āśraya jatana kariye,

sthira rahiye kāje

tṛpta bhakativinoda-prāṇ,

nāma binā kachu nāhiń aur,

sakala-bhuvana-mājhe


 


TRANSLATION


1)
When the rising sun appeared in the East, the jewel of the twice-born, Lord
Gaurasundara, awakened, and, taking His devotees with Him, He went all over the
countryside towns and villages


 


2)
The mrdangas (khol) resounded "tathai, tathai," and the jhanjha
[large metal karatalas that look like small cymbals] in that kirtana played in
time. Lord Gauranga's golden form slightly trembled in ecstatic love of
Godhead, and His footbells jingled.


 


3)
All the devotees chanted the names Mukunda, Madhava, Yadava and Hari, their
mouths being filled with the vibrations. They would announce to the still
sleeping people, "You spend your nights uselessly sleeping and your days
decorating your bodies!


 


4)
You have achieved such a rare human body, but you do not care for this gift.
You remain not serving the darling of Yasoda and slowly fall through your last
moments to death.


 


5)
With every rising and setting of the sun, a day passes and is lost. Then, why
do you remain idle and not serve the Lord of the heart?


 


6)
This temporary life is full of various miseries. Take shelter of the holy name
as your only business.


 


7)
To penetrate the darkness of ignorance and bless everyone's heart, the holy
name has risen like the shining sun.


 


8)
Drink the pure nectar of the holy name of Krsna. There is nothing but the name
to be had in the fourteen worlds. It has filled the soul of Sri Bhaktivinoda
Thakura.
