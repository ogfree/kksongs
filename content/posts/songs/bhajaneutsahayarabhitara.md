TRANSLATION


1)
"Within, without, he who serves with (1) enthusiasm will gradually attain
to the rarest pure devotion.


 


2)
In devotion to Lord 
Krsna
, one who has (2) firm faith
is a person loyal and devoted on the path.


 


3)
And if Sri 
Krsna's
 service he fails to attain, yet
practices with (3) patience - devout is such a man.


 


4)
That which serves Lord 
Krsna
, for only 
Krsna's
 pleasure, in such action, the devotee can never
feel anger.


 


5)
Abandoning the company of the non-devotee, ever with devotees, the devout serve
Sri 
Hari
.


 


6)
Following the pure devotees' direction on the path, the true devout practice,
as a matter of life and death.


 


7)
Who follow these six qualities qualify for pure devotion -they purify the
universe by their preaching mission."
