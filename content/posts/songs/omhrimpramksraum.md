TRANSLATION


May
my head be protected by the moon colored one, who is the greatest among humans.
My obeisances unto the ferocious and powerful, the great Visnu, the fiery one,
who's faces are on all sides, the fearful one, Nrsimha, who causes the death of
even death personified, (or who can overcome death)
