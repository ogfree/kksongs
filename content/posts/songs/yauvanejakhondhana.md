TRANSLATION


1)
When I was young, I greatly desired to earn money. At that time bearing in mind
the codes of religion, I took a wife.


 


2)
Together we set up a household, wasted much time, had many sons and daughters;
my heart grew heavy.


 


3) The
burden increased day by day, I felt my life at a standstill. Old age came,
grabbed me, and made my mind fickle and disturbed.


 


4)
Diseases trouble me now, and constant anxiety has made me feverish. My heart
burns from lack of satisfaction, and I see no way out. All is darkness and I am
very much afraid.


 


5) The
current of this worldly river is strong and relentless. A frightening, gloomy
death approaches. How I wish I could give up my worldly attachments. I would
worship You, O Lord, but it is a useless hope.


 


6) Now
please hear me, O Lord, for I am utterly helpless. Bhaktivinoda says, Â“Without
Your mercy, everything is lost. Please give me the shelter of Your lotus feet.Â”
