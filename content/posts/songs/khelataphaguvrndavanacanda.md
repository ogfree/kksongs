TRANSLATION


1)
Â  
He who is like a moon shining in 
Vrndavana
 forest enjoys pastimes of throwing red powder. He
is filled with 
Kamadeva's
 desires.


 


2) In the midst of circle
of beautiful 
gopis
 
a blissful
,
reddish, wave-filled river of spiritual love flows.


 


3) She who is the great
heroine of amorous pastimes showers red powder on Him. He who is the king of
amorous pastimes kisses 
Her
 face.


 


4) Her moon-faced 
gopi
 friends are filled with wonder. Gathering together,
they all attack 
Krsna
.


 


5) Trembling, they run to 
Krsna
, snatch away His flute, and flee. 


 


6) "
Bhali
! 
Bhali
!" the 
karatalas
 declare. There is a great tumult of, "Ho!
Ho! 
Holi
!"


 


7) The ground is now red
with powder. They young trees are red. Every being moving on the ground or in
the water is now one color only.


 


8) The water is red. The
lotuses are red. Even 
Govinda
 
dasa's

heart is covered now with red.

song is sung in Raga
