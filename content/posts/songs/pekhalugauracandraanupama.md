TRANSLATION


Refrain:
The person I saw is peerless Lord 
Gauracandra
. He does
not ask for anything in the three worlds. He wishes only the jewel of Lord 
Krsna's
 holy name.


 


1)
One person says: Â“This is an ocean of the wonderful nectar of ecstatic
spiritual love.Â” Another 
persons
 says: Â“This is nectar
personified.Â” Another says: Â“This is a 
kalpa-taru

tree.Â” In my heart a doubt now arises.


 


2)
He does not ask for even a single drop of water from the ocean of material
happiness. He will accept only the water that falls from the 
raincloud
 of spiritual love. He is a 
kalpa-taru

tree that fulfills the desires of every heart. Who is limitlessly merciful like
Him?


 


3)
The nectar of His pastimes flows along the pathway of the ears, enters the lake
of the heart, exits from the eyes in the form of tears, irrigates the dry land
of the limbs, and makes to sprout the plants of the bodily hairs standing erect
in ecstasy.


 


4)
His holy name cools the burning sufferings of this world. Shall we compare His
holy name to the cooling moon? 
Ghanasyama
 
dasa
 says: Â“No. His holy name is like millions and millions
of moons standing in one place.Â”
