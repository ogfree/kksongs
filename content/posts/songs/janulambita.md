TRANSLATION


1) His
arms extend to His knees and He appears to be like a golden doll. His form is
adorned with a cloth that has the color of the rising sun. His beauty is
incomparable.


 


2) His
magnanimous form shines brightly with a beautiful smile radiating from His
lotus like face. His large and prominent chest and broad shoulders are even
more majestic than a lionÂ’s.


 


3) His
toe nails are brighter than the full moon and golden ankle bells adorn them.
Seeing His exquisite beauty to be more brilliant than the sun, the entire world
becomes enchanted.


 


4) The
incarnations for the age of Kali are Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and Nityananda
Prabhu. Without considering whether one is sinful or a miscreant, They
distribute Their mercy. Vrndavana dasa sings glory of These two personalities:
His worshippable Lords Sri Krsna Caitanya Mahaprabhu and Nityananda Prabhu.
