TRANSLATION


1) Arjuna said: I have
heard 
Your
 instruction on confidential spiritual
matters which You have so kindly delivered unto me, and my illusion is now
dispelled. 


 


2) O lotus-eyed one, I have
heard from 
You
 in detail about the appearance and
disappearance of every living entity, as realized through Your inexhaustible
glories. 


 


3) O greatest of all
personalities, O supreme form, though I see here before me 
Your

actual position, I wish to see how You have entered into this cosmic
manifestation. I want to see that form of 
Yours
. 


 


4) If 
You

think that I am able to behold Your cosmic form, O my Lord, O master of all
mystic power, then kindly show me that universal Self. 


 


5) The Blessed Lord said: My
dear Arjuna, O son of Prtha, behold now 
My
 opulences, hundreds
of thousands of varied divine forms, multicolored like the sea. 


 


6) O best of the 
Bharatas,
 see here the different manifestations of Adityas, Rudras,
and all the demigods. Behold the many things which no one has ever seen or
heard before. 


 


7) Whatever you wish to see
can be seen all at once in this body. This universal form can show you all that
you now desire, as well as whatever you may desire in the future. Everything is
here completely. 


 


8) But you cannot see 
Me
 with your present eyes. Therefore I give to you divine
eyes by which you can behold 
My
 mystic opulence. 


 


9) Sanjaya said: O King, speaking
thus, the Supreme, the Lord of all mystic power, the Personality of Godhead, displayed
His universal form to Arjuna. 


 


10-11) Arjuna saw in that
universal form unlimited mouths and unlimited eyes. It was all wondrous. The
form was decorated with divine, dazzling ornaments and arrayed in many garbs. He
was garlanded gloriously, and there were many scents smeared over His body. All
was magnificent, all-expanding, unlimited. This was seen by Arjuna. 


 


12) If hundreds of
thousands of suns rose up at once into the sky, they might resemble the
effulgence of the Supreme Person in that universal form. 


 


13) At that time Arjuna
could see in the universal form of the Lord the unlimited expansions of the
universe situated in one place although divided into many, many thousands. 


 


14) Then, bewildered and
astonished, his hair standing on end, Arjuna began to pray with folded hands, offering
obeisances to the Supreme Lord. 


 


15) Arjuna said: My dear
Lord Krsna, I see assembled together in 
Your
 body all
the demigods and various other living entities. I see Brahma sitting on the lotus
flower as well as Lord Siva and many sages and divine serpents. 


 


16) O Lord of the universe,
I see in 
Your
 universal body many, many forms--bellies,
mouths, eyes--expanded without limit. There is no end, there is no beginning, and
there is no middle to all this. 


 


17) Your form, adorned with
various crowns, clubs and discs, is difficult to see because of its glaring
effulgence, which is fiery and immeasurable like the sun. 


 


18) You are the supreme
primal objective; 
You
 are the best in all the
universes; You are inexhaustible, and You are the oldest; You are the
maintainer of religion, the eternal Personality of Godhead. 


 


19) You are the origin
without beginning, middle or end. You have numberless arms, and the sun and
moon are among 
Your
 great unlimited eyes. By Your own
radiance 
You
 are heating this entire universe. 


 


20) Although 
You
 are one, You are spread throughout the sky and the
planets and all space between. O great one, as I behold this terrible form, I
see that all the planetary systems are perplexed. 


 


21) All the demigods are
surrendering and entering into 
You
. They are very much
afraid, and with folded hands they are singing the Vedic hymns. 


 


22) The different
manifestations of Lord Siva, the Adityas, the Vasus, the Sadhyas, the
Visvedevas, the two Asvis, the Maruts, the forefathers and the Gandharvas, the
Yaksas, Asuras, and all perfected demigods are beholding 
You

in wonder. 


 


23) O mighty-armed one, all
the planets with their demigods are disturbed at seeing 
Your

many faces, eyes, arms, bellies and legs and Your terrible teeth, and as they
are disturbed, so am I. 


 


24) O all-pervading Visnu, I
can no longer maintain my equilibrium. Seeing 
Your

radiant colors fill the skies and beholding Your eyes and mouths, I am afraid. 


 


25) O Lord of lords, O
refuge of the worlds, please 
be
 gracious to me. I
cannot keep my balance seeing thus 
Your
 blazing
deathlike faces and awful teeth. In all directions I am bewildered. 


 


26-27) 
All

the sons of Dhrtarastra along with their allied kings, and Bhisma, Drona and
Karna, and all our soldiers are rushing into Your mouths, their heads smashed
by Your fearful teeth. I see that some are being crushed between 
Your
 teeth as well. 


 


28) As the rivers flow into
the sea, so all these great warriors enter 
Your

blazing mouths and perish. 


 


29) I see all people
rushing with full speed into 
Your
 mouths as moths dash
into a blazing fire. 


 


30) O Visnu, I see 
You
 devouring all people in Your flaming mouths and covering
the universe with Your immeasurable rays. Scorching the worlds, 
You
 are manifest. 


 


31) O Lord of lords, so
fierce of form, please 
tell
 me who You are. I offer my
obeisances unto 
You
; please be gracious to me. I do
not know what 
Your
 mission is, and I desire to hear of
it. 


 


32) The Blessed Lord said: Time
I am, destroyer of the worlds, and I have come to engage all people. With the
exception of you [the Pandavas], all the soldiers here on both sides will be
slain. 


 


33) Therefore get up and
prepare to fight. After conquering your enemies you will enjoy a flourishing
kingdom. They are already put to death by 
My

arrangement, and you, O Savyasaci, can be but an instrument in the fight. 


 


34) The Blessed Lord said: All
the great warriors--Drona, Bhisma, Jayadratha, 
Karna
--are
already destroyed. Simply 
fight,
 and you will vanquish
your enemies. 


 


35) Sanjaya said to
Dhrtarastra: O King, after hearing these words from the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Arjuna trembled, fearfully offered obeisances with folded hands and
began, falteringly, to speak as follows: 


 


36) O Hrsikesa, the world
becomes joyful upon hearing 
Your
 name, and thus
everyone becomes attached to You. Although the perfected beings offer 
You
 their respectful homage, the demons are afraid, and they
flee here and there. All this is rightly done. 


 


37) O great one, who stands
above even Brahma, You are the original master. Why should they not offer their
homage up to You, O limitless one? O refuge of the universe, 
You

are the invincible source, the cause of all causes, transcendental to this
material manifestation. 


 


38) You are the original
Personality, the Godhead. You are the only sanctuary of this manifested cosmic
world. You know everything, and 
You
 are all that is
knowable. You are above the material modes O limitless form! This whole cosmic
manifestation is pervaded by 
You
! 


 


39) You are air, fire, water,
and 
You
 are the moon! You are the supreme controller
and the grandfather. Thus I offer my respectful obeisances unto 
You
 a thousand times, and again and yet again! 


 


40) Obeisances from the
front, from behind and from all sides! O unbounded power, 
You

are the master of limitless might! You are all-pervading, and thus 
You
 are everything! 


 


41-42) I have in the past
addressed 
You
 as "O Krsna," "O Yadava,"
"O my friend," without knowing Your glories. Please forgive whatever
I may have done in madness or in love. I have dishonored 
You

many times while relaxing or while lying on the same bed or eating together, sometimes
alone and sometimes in front of many friends. Please excuse me for all my
offenses. 


 


43) You are the father of
this complete cosmic manifestation, the worshipable chief, the spiritual master.
No one is equal to 
You
, nor can anyone be one with You.
Within the three worlds, 
You
 are immeasurable. 


 


44) You are the Supreme
Lord, to be worshiped by every living being. Thus I fall down to offer 
You
 my respects and ask Your mercy. Please tolerate the
wrongs that I may have done to 
You
 and bear with me as
a father with his son, or a friend with his friend, or a lover with his beloved.



 


45) After seeing this
universal form, which I have never seen before, I am gladdened, but at the same
time my mind is disturbed with fear. Therefore please bestow 
Your

grace upon me and reveal again Your form as the Personality of Godhead, O Lord
of lords, O abode of the universe. 


 


46) O universal Lord, I
wish to see 
You
 in Your four-armed form, with helmeted
head and with club, wheel, conch and lotus flower in Your hands. I long to see 
You
 in that form. 


 


47) The Blessed Lord said: My
dear Arjuna, happily do I show you this universal form within the material
world by 
My
 internal potency. No one before you has
ever seen this unlimited and glaringly effulgent form. 


 


48) O best of the Kuru
warriors, no one before you has ever seen this universal form of 
Mine
, for neither by studying the Vedas, nor by performing
sacrifices, nor by charities or similar activities can this form be seen. Only
you have seen this. 


 


49) Your mind has been
perturbed upon seeing this horrible feature of 
Mine
. Now
let it be finished. My devotee, be free from all disturbance. With a peaceful
mind you can now see the form you desire. 


 


50) Sanjaya said to
Dhrtarastra: The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, while speaking thus to
Arjuna, displayed His real four-armed form, and at last He showed him His two-armed
form, thus encouraging the fearful Arjuna. 


 


51) When Arjuna thus saw
Krsna in His original form, he said: Seeing this humanlike form, so very
beautiful, my mind is now pacified and I am restored to my original nature. 


 


52) The Blessed Lord said: My
dear Arjuna, the form which you are now seeing is very difficult to behold. Even
the demigods are ever seeking the opportunity to see this form which is so dear.



 


53) The
form which you are seeing with your transcendental eyes cannot be understood
simply by studying the Vedas, nor by undergoing serious penances, nor by
charity, nor by worship.
 It is
not by these means that one can see 
Me
 as I am. 


 


54) My dear Arjuna, only by
undivided devotional service can I be understood as I am, standing before you, and
can thus be seen directly. Only in this way can you enter into the mysteries of

My
 understanding. 


 


55) My dear Arjuna, one who
is engaged in 
My
 pure devotional service, free from
the contaminations of previous activities and from mental speculation, who is
friendly to every living entity, certainly comes to Me.


 


56) Thus Bhaktivedanta
sings the song of Sri Gita, with the hope that hearing this, Krsna conscious
pure devotees will be pleased.
