TRANSLATION


1) The love of the 
gopis
 for 
Krsna
 is full of
transcendental ecstasy. It appears to be a brilliant jewel, and enlightened by
such a transcendental jewel, 
Radha's
 body is further
perfumed and decorated with 
kunkuma
.


 


2) In the morning 
Her
 body is bathed in the nectar of compassion, in the
afternoon in the nectar of youth, and in the evening in the nectar of luster
itself. In this way the bathing is performed, and 
Her

body becomes as brilliant as the 
cintamani
 jewel. She
eclipses the goddess of fortune 
Laksmidevi
.


 


3) Her dress is composed of
various kinds of silken garments, which may be compared to 
Her

natural shyness. Her beauty is more and more enhanced, being decorated with 
kunkuma
, which is compared to beauty itself, and with
blackish musk, which is compared to conjugal love. Thus 
Her

body is decorated with different colors. The 
kunkuma

is red and the musk is black.


 


4-5) 
Her

ornaments embody the natural symptoms of ecstasy: trembling, tears, jubilation,
stunning, perspiration, faltering of the voice, bodily redness, madness, and
dullness. In this way the entire body is bedecked with these nine different
jewels. Over and above this, the beauty of 
Her
 body is
enhanced by Her transcendental qualities, which hang as a flower garland on Her
body. The ecstasy of love for 
Krsna
 is known as 
dhira
 and 
adhira
, sober and
restless. Such ecstasy constitutes the covering of Sri 
Radha's

body, and it is adorned by camphor.


 


6) Her transcendental anger
toward 
Krsna
 is embodied as the arrangement of the
hair on 
Her
 head, and the 
tilaka

of Her great fortune shines on Her beautiful forehead. The earrings of Sri 
Radha
 are the holy names of 
Krsna
,
as well as the hearing of His name and fame.


 


7) Her lips are always
reddish due to the 
betelnut
 of 
ecstati

affection for 
Krsna
. The black ointment around 
Her
 eyes is Her tricky behavior with 
Krsna

brought about by love. Her joking with 
Krsna
 and
gentle smiling is the camphor with which 
She
 is
perfumed.


 


8) She sleeps in 
Her
 room with the aroma of pride, and when She lies down in
Her bed, the transcendental variety of Her loving ecstasies is like a jeweled
locket in the midst of Her necklace of separation.


 


9) Her transcendental
breasts are covered by 
Her
 sari in the form of
affection and anger toward 
Krsna
. She has a stringed
instrument known as a 
kacchapi-vina
, which is the
fame and fortune that actually dries up the faces and breasts of the other 
gopis
.


 


10) She always keeps 
Her
 hands on the shoulder of Her 
gopi

friend, who is compared to Her youthful beauty, and although She is highly
qualified with so many spiritual assets, She is nonetheless affected by the
Cupid known as 
Krsna
. Thus 
She

is defeated.


 


11) O Sri 
Radha
, this person offers respectful 
obeisances

unto 
You
, taking a straw in his mouth. This person is
very unhappy. Please bring him to life by sprinkling him with the nectar of
service to 
You
.


 


12) O 
Gandharvika
,
Sri 
Radha
, just as Lord 
Krsna

never rejects a surrendered soul, please don't reject me.


 


13) The person who reads
these this regal prayer, which bears the title Sri 
Premambhoja-maranda
,
will attain the direct service that brings with it the mercy of Sri 
Radha
.
