TRANSLATION


1) I am meditating on the Supreme Person known as 
Nrsimha

who is attainable through Vedanta philosophy. He is the carrier of the conch
and the 
Sudarsana
 disc, and He is the only means for
crossing the ocean of birth and death.


 


2) You mercifully protect 
Nila
 and 
Rama
 with Your chaste, spiritual internal potency. You also
extend 
Your
 protective energy over 
Prahlada

Maharaja. O 
Nrsimha
 please 
protect

me too, for I am also trying to be Your devotee. 


 


3) Your lotus feet are comparable in effulgence to the brilliance of
the sum total of the jewelry possessed by all the demigods. Your roaring is
like that of the thundering clouds at the universal dissolution. O 
Nrsimha
 please 
protect
 me too, for
I am also trying to be Your devotee.


 


4) You are the maintainer of 
Prahlada

Maharaja and 
Your
 open mouth is exactly as the sun
which causes the destruction of the universe. O Lord, Your grunts frightens all
the roaming predators of the night. You are always beautifully glorified by
sages such as 
Narada
 
Muni
.
O 
Nrsimha
 please 
protect
 me
too, for I am also trying to be Your devotee.


 


5) O 
Nrisimha
, Your divine form is
horrifying. You are tearing apart all the wild animals descending from the
caves of the mountains to terrify and to drink the blood of everyone. O 
Nrisimha
 please 
protect
 me too,
for I am also trying to be Your devotee.


 


6) O King of the yogis, Lord of lords and the protector of the process
of yoga. You are the remover of the sufferings of those who are dear to 
You
. Your wonderful form is described in the agamas. Please
glance upon me who 
is
 without shelter and possesses no
good qualities. O 
Nrsimha
 please 
protect

me too, for I am also trying to be Your devotee.


 


7) You are the auspicious lion that dispersed the grief of 
Prahlada
 Maharaja. O Powerful Lion, who tears everything
apart in an intoxicated mood, 
You
 are the Lord of the
ferocious predators of the dark night. Your lotus feet are surrounded by all
divine and pious personalities beginning with Lord 
Indra
.
O 
Nrsimha
 please 
protect
 me
too, for I am also trying to be Your devotee.


 


8) Some people try to embrace 
Your
 lotus feet
through the process of knowledge. Others try by performing pious activities and
yet others by the path of devotion. O 
Murari
 by Your
mercy all of them attain liberation. O 
Nrsimha
 please

protect
 me too, for I am also trying to be Your
devotee.
