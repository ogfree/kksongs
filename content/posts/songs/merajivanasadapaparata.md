TRANSLATION


1) I am an impious sinner
and have caused others great anxiety and trouble.


 


2) I have never hesitated
to perform sinful act for my own enjoyment. Devoid of all compassion, concerned
only with my own selfish interests, I am remorseful seeing others happy. I am a
perpetual liar, and the misery of others is a source of great pleasure for me.


 


3) The material desires
within the core of my heart are unlimited. I am wrathful, devoted to false
pride and arrogance, intoxicated by vanity, and bewildered by worldly affairs.
Envy and egotism are the ornaments I wear.


 


4) Ruined by laziness and
sleep, I resist all pious deeds; yet I am very active and enthusiastic to
perform wicked acts. For worldly fame and reputation I engage in the practice
of deceitfulness. Thus I am destroyed by my own greed and am always lustful.


 


5) A vile, wicked man such
as this, rejected by godly people, is a constant offender. I am such a person,
devoid of all good works, forever inclined toward evil, worn out and wasted by
various miseries.


 


6) Now in old age, deprived
of all means of success, humbled and poor, 
Bhaktivinoda

submits his tale of grief at the feet of the Supreme Lord.
