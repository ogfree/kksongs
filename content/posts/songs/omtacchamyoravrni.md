TRANSLATION


(Invocation)
We worship and pray to the Supreme Lord for the welfare of all beings. May all miseries
and shortcomings leave us forever so that we may always sing for the Lord
during the holy fire ceremonies. May all medicinal herbs grow in potency so
that all diseases may be cured. May the gods rain peace on us. May all the
two-legged creatures be happy, and may all the four-legged creatures also be
happy. May there be peace in the hearts of all beings in all realms. 


 


1)
The 
Purusa
 (the Supreme Being) has a thousand heads,
a thousand eyes and a thousand feet. He has enveloped this world from all sides
and has (even) transcended it by ten 
angulas
 or
inches.


 


2)
All this is verily the 
Purusa
. All that which existed
in the past or will come into being in the future (is also the 
Purusa
). Also, he is the Lord of immortality. That which
grows profusely by food (is also the 
Purusa
).


 


3)
So much is His greatness. However, the 
Purusa
 is
greater than this. All the beings form only a quarter (part of) Him. The
three-quarter part of His, which is eternal, is established in the spiritual
domain.


 


4)
The 
Purusa
 with the three-quarters (of His energy)
ascended above (the spiritual energy). His one quarter of material energy
becomes this creation again (and again). Then He pervades this universe
comprising a variety of sentient beings and insentient objects.


 


5)
From Him (the 
Adi
 
Purusa
 or
original Supreme Being) was born the 
Virat
 (or 
Virat
 
Purusa
, the immense
universal form). Making this 
Virat
 as the substratum
(another) 
Purusa
 (or being, Brahma) (was born). As
soon as he was born, he multiplied himself. Later, he created this earth and
then, the bodies (of the living beings).


 


6)
When the 
devas
 (the demigods or beings of light)
performed a 
yajna
 (or sacrificial ritual), using the 
Purusa
 as the 
havis
 (sacrificial
material) for the 
yajna
 (ritual), the 
Vasanta
 (spring) became the 
ajya

(ghee), the 
Grishma
 (summer) served as 
idhma
 (pieces of wood) and the 
sharad

(autumn) filled the place of 
havis
 (obligatory
material like the 
purodasha
 or rice-cake).


 


7)
For this (
yajna
 or spiritual ceremony) there were
seven 
paridhis
 (fuel pieces serving as borders). And,
twenty-one items were made the 
samit
 or sacrificial
fuel sticks. When the 
devas
 were performing this 
yajna
 or ceremony, they tied the 
Purusa

(himself) as the 
pasu
 (sacrificial animal).


 


8)
The 
devas
, the 
sadhyas
 and
the 
rsis
 performed the sacrifice by using that 
Purusa
 as the means of 
yajna
, the

Purusa
 who had been born in the beginning, after
sprinkling him with water by the 
barhis
 (or
sacrificial grass).


 


9)
From that 
yajna
 (or sacrificial ritual) wherein the
Cosmic Being was Himself the oblation, was produced the 
prasajya

(or curds mixed with ghee). Birds flying in the air, wild animals of the forest
as also the domesticated animals of the villages were also produced.


 


10)
From that 
yajna
 (or sacrifice) wherein the Cosmic
Being was Himself the oblation, were born the 
riks

(the mantras of the 
Rg-veda
) and the 
samans
 (the mantras of the 
Sama-veda
).
From that (
yajna
) the meters (like 
Gayatri
) were born. From that (
yajna

again) the 
yujas
 (the 
Yajura-veda
)
was born. 


 


11)
From that were born the horses, as also animals (like donkeys and mules) which
have two rows of teeth. From that were born the cattle. From that (again) were
born goats and sheep.


 


12)
(Now some questions are raised by the sages) When the gods decided to (mentally)
sacrifice the 
ViratPurusa
 (and produce further
creation), in how many ways did they do it? What became of his face or mouth?
What became of his two arms? What became of His two thighs? What were (the
products of) the two feet called?


 


13)
From His face (or the mouth) came the 
brahmanas
. From
His two arms came the 
rajanya
 (the 
ksatriyas
). From His two thighs came the 
vaisyas
. From His two feet came the 
sudras
.


 


14)
From His mind was born the moon. From His two eyes was born the sun. From His
mouth were born 
Indra
 and 
Agni
.
From His breath was born the air.


 


15)
From (His) navel was produced the 
antariksha
 (the
space between the earth and the heavens). 
Dyuloka
 (or
heaven) came into existence from His head. The 
bhumi

(the earth) evolved out of His feet, and 
deek
 (or 
spacial
 directions) from His ears. Similarly (the demigods)
produced the worlds (too).


 


16)
I know (through intuitive experience) this great 
Purusa

(the Supreme Being), the wise one, who, having created the various forms and
the nomenclatures (for those forms), deals with them by those names, and who is
beyond darkness and is brilliant like the sun.


 


17)
In the ancient days, 
Prajapati
 (Brahma) praised Him. 
Indra
 who knows all the four quarters also spoke about Him.
Anyone who knows Him thus, will become immortal even in this life. For
attaining liberation there is no other path (than knowledge of this 
Purusa
, the Supreme Lord).


 


18)
The (
demi
)gods worshiped (the Supreme Creator in the
form of) 
yajna
 through 
yajna

(
sacrifical
 ceremonies). Those very processes became
the primary 
dharmas
 (laws guiding humanity). Those
great ones attain that heaven where the ancient 
devas

(demigods) and 
sadhyas
 live.


 


19)
The 
ViratPurusa
 manifested Himself from out of (the
all-pervading) water as also the essence of the element of earth. This 
ViratPurusa
 was born out of the greatness of the 
ParamaPurusa
, the Creator. The (
ParamaPurusa
,
known as) 
Tvashta
 engaged Himself in the act of
creating (the fourteen planetary systems), (which form of the expanded) figure
(of the 
ViratPurusa
). (Thus) the entire creation
(related to the 
ViratPurusa
) came into existence in
the very beginning of creation.


 


20)
I have known that great 
Purusa
 (Supreme Being) who is
brilliant like the sun and who is beyond all darkness. One who knows Him thus
becomes immortal (even) here. There is no other path for liberation than this.


 


21)

Prajapati
 (the Supreme Creator) moves inside the
cosmic womb. (Though) unborn He takes birth in a variety of ways. The wise ones
know His (real nature) as the origin (of the universe). The (secondary)
creators desire to attain the positions of 
Marichi

and others.


 


22)

Obeisances
 to Him, the self-luminous Brahman, who
shines for the (
demi
)gods, who is the leader of the
rituals of the gods and who was born even before the gods.


 


23)
In the beginning of creation, the gods, manifesting the light of Brahman,
addressed Brahman thus: "That 
brahmana
 who
realizes (You) thus, all the gods will come under his control."


 


24)
O 
Purusa
! The goddesses 
Hri

(modesty) and Sri (
Lakshmi
, wealth) are Your
consorts. Day and night are Your lateral limbs. The stars are Your form. The 
Ashvins
 are your widely opened (mouth). (O 
Purusa
) fulfill our desire for self-knowledge as also our
desire for the enjoyments of this world (like longevity, cows, and horses).
Give us all that we need. 
Om
, let there be peace, peace, peace.
