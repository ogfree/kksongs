LYRICS:


(1)


I bow
before Lord Krsnacandra's feet,


Feet
that with a dancing motion walk,


Feet
with marks of gracefulness replete,


Feet
that seem to eloquently talk


 


(2)


With
jingling jewel anklets glistening,


Feet
that mark the forest's sacred ground,


Feet
that quickly stop as, listening


To the
faraway and unexpected sound


 


(3)


Of
Vrajapura's doe-eyed teenage girls


Talking
and joking and laughing as they take


Wild
flowers from the trees and as their curls


And
eyes move restlessly the playful rake


 


(4)


Lord
Krsnacandra stops O then arise


Festivals
of smiles within His eyes.
