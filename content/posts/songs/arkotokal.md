WORD
FOR WORD TRANSLATION: 
Ar
Koto Kal


 


TRANSLATION


1)
After how long will I see You, O darling Giridhari Lal? Until then, I will
simply remain here, waiting and waiting! Tears are flowing incessantly from my
eyes. O when will You give me Your glance?


 


2) O
dear Lord, I have surrendered my mind and body, as flowers for worship, to Your
lotus feet. I have a plea. My heart is fervent based on such hope. Will they go
unfulfilled?


 


3) As
I wait behind for You, Oh please play Your flute, as Your flute contain all the
sweet mellow melodic notes.


 


4) O
Merciless One, if You donÂ’t provide me Your glimpse, why did You fill my heart
with such hope? O life and soul of Mira! My desire is only for You! When will
my desire be fulfilled?
