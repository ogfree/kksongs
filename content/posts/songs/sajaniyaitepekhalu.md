TRANSLATION


(Refrain)
O 
gopi
-friend, I saw Krsna. If I attain Him I will
have the whole world. He struck me with the flower-arrow of His glance. Now my
eyes see none but Him.


 


1)
His form was glorious like a monsoon cloud. He was charming with graceful
ornaments. The glance from his reddish eyes defeats lightning. That glance
burned this saintly girl's shyness into ashes.


 


2)
When He saw my face, He smiled. His body trembled, and He dropped His charming
flute. He bit a budding twig. What desire filled Him? I do not know.


 


3)
Since that time my heart burns at every moment. My restless life-breath
trembles. 
Govinda
 
dasa

says: Your hope is false. Krsna will not meet with you yet.
