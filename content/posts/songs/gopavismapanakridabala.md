TRANSLATION


1)
O 
Krsna
, when the children described that 
You
 had caused (the two trees to fall), the cowherd men
because greatly amazed. A bewildered 
Nanda
 Maharaja
gazed at 
You
 as a smile broke forth upon Your lips.


 


2)
O 
Krsna
, having pulled the grinding mortar, 
You
 remained among the fallen 
yamala-arjuna

trees. 
Nanda
 Maharaja untied the rope used for tying
cows which had bound 
Your
 splendid waist.


 


3)
O 
Krsna
, in order to show how 
You

submissively accept the dominion of Your devotees, You danced, following the
encouragement of the 
gopis
. You jubilantly and
intently sang in a childish voice, at their bidding and charmingly struck 
Your
 arms to Your chest (to show Your strength). In this way

You
 enchanted the minds of inhabitants of 
Vraja
.


 


4)
O 
Krsna
, following the orders of Mother 
Yasoda
 and the other 
gopis
, 
You
 would carry the wooden bench and other articles. You
expertly begged for sweets cooked in butter, and the ocean of nectar of 
Your
 pastimes charmed the residents of 
Vrajabhumi
.
O Lord. I offer respectful 
obeisances
 unto 
You
.
