TRANSLATION


1) 
O Lord who became angry at
Dvivida's terrible mischief, O Lord who enjoyed pastimes on Mount Raivata, O
Lord unseen by the foolish conditioned souls, . . .


 


2) O Lord who enjoyed
pastimes with many beautiful gopis, O Lord who was angered by a gorilla's
arrogant mischief, O Lord who wonderfully fought with the gorilla, . . .


 


3) 
O Lord who after a long duel
finally killed the most wicked of gorillas, O Lord who was pleased by the
prayers and obeisances of the demigods and sages, O Lord who gathered the
Yadava armies when the Kauravas kidnapped Samba, . . .


 


4) O Lord who went to the Kauravas'
capitol to make peace with them, O Lord who heard their 
insults,
. . .


 


5) O Lord who became very
angry with the Kauravas, O Lord who with Your plow dragged Hastinapura, O Lord
who filled everyone with wonder, . . .


 


6) O Lord of whose feet the
frightened Kauravas took shelter, O Lord who thus ended the quarrel, O Lord who
saw Samba and his wife reunited, O Lord who happily took them home, . . .


 


7) O brother of Lord Krsna,
O Lord who took birth in Gokula, O Lord Balarama who enjoys pastimes like those
of a human being, glory, glory, glory to You!
