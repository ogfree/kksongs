TRANSLATION


1) Glory, glory to the Lord
who is like a moon 
risen
 from the ocean of the 
Yadu
 dynasty, to the Lord who is the bliss of 
Gokula's
 pastures! 


 


2) Glory, glory to the Lord
whose limbs are dark like a monsoon cloud, the Lord whose graceful form bends
in three places like a bending 
kalpa-taru
 tree!


 


3) His pastime is to play
nectar melodies on His flute. The sweetness of His smile enchants everyone in
the world.


 


4) He lingers in the forest
of new flowers. He is like a mango tree where black bees hum.


 


5) The lotus flowers of the
soles of His feet glisten with a charming new redness. 
Govinda


dasa
 worships the jewels that are the nails of His
toes.
