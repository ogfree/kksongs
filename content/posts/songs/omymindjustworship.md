LYRICS:


(Refrain)


O my
mind, just worship the lotus feet of the son of Nanda


Which
make one fearless.


 


(1)


Having
obtained this very rare form of human birth,


Please
make sure you realize its true worth


Taking
shelter of saintly persons


to
cross over this material ocean


 


(2)


Day
and night I am burning from heat


Freezing
from the cold - not realizing the spirit soul


Wasting
my time in work for a miserly man


To
fulfill his miserly plan


For
happiness that flickers like a candle


 


(3)


Health
and wealth, friends and family


Of
what use to me are all of these, ultimately?


This
life is fleeting, uncertain the final hour.


Just
like a drop of water sitting on the lotus flower


 


(4)


Hearing
and chanting, remembering and praying,


Offering
service and submissively obeying


Worshiping
a dear friend, offering everything


This
song of Govinda dasa from my heart I sing
