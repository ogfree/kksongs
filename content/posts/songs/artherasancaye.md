TRANSLATION


1-2)
O Lord Hari, I have become absorbed in accumulating wealth and endeavoring for
material possessions. I am addicted to speaking of topics apart from You and am
always eager to accept practices apart from my own duties. I am in the habit of
meeting with worldly men and am absorbed in speculative thinking. Therefore,
devotion to You has remained distant from me. In this heart of mine dwells only
envy and malice towards others false pride, hypocrisy, deceitfulness, and the
desire for fame and honor.


 


3)
I have not been able to give up any of these attachments. Thus my own faults
have been my down fall. My birth as a human being has been wasted. O Lord Hari,
what am I to do now?


 


4)
I am indeed fallen; but Your holy name is the savior of the fallen. Clinging to
that holy name, I have taken shelter at Your lotus feet.
