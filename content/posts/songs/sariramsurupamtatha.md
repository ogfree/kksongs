TRANSLATION


1) The body is handsome, the wife is attractive, the fame is spread far
and wide, the wealth is enormous and stable like mount 
Meru
;
but of what consequence are all these, if the mind is not fixed in devotion to
the lotus feet of Guru? Really of what use is all this, what use, what use?


 


2) Wife, wealth, son, grandson, and the like, house, relations, even if
all these are there fate is certain, of what consequence is one's life if his
mind is not devoted to the feet of Guru? Ascertain, what use is any possession,
person or object? Of what use, of what use, of what use indeed?


 


3) All the Vedas are mastered and ever present on the lips; likewise,
knowledge of all the sciences is well gained. The ability to write prose or
verse is also present. Even then, of what ultimate benefit is all this, if
one's mind does not devoutly rest on the feet of Guru? By whose grace along can
one's soul be liberated? Of what use, of what use, of what use indeed?


 


4) I am honored well even in far off places, held in high esteem in my
own locality; in good conduct and noble deeds there is no one to excel me. If
one has occasion to think like this, of what avail is it if the mind is not
steeped in devotion and humility towards the feet of the Guru from whom alone
can flow wisdom and immortality?


 


5) Your feet may be worshipped constantly even by the great kings and
emperors of the world for reason of your greatness and scholarship; but of what
real consequence is that if the mind is not graced by the blessing of
unflinching devotion to the Guru, by whose loving 'touch' alone can redemption
and peace be realized?


 


6) Of what avail if one has enough merits to think my fame has already
spread in several places due to my unique generosity and a result, all things of
the world stand within my easy reach? For, the virtue and quality that count
ultimately is only one's unflinching loyalty and devotion towards the Guru
whose blessings are the ultimate factor for realization of Truth by a devoted
seeker.


 


7) The mind may have turned away from external delights through
dispassion and from attainments like Yogic concentration, possessions like
horses and the like, the enchanting face of the beloved, in short, the entire
wealth of the earth; yet it will be of no real merit if the mind is not
absorbed in piety and devotion to the feet of Guru. Bereft of this devotion, of
what benefit is anything, of what benefit, of what benefit?


 


8) The mind may have lost its charm to live in forests, and likewise in
the house; may have lost all desire to achieve whatever; even the concern for
the body's welfare may have been outlived; the most invaluable treasure of the
world may not hold any allurement. Even then, of what avail are all these if
the supreme devotion to the Guru is not held by the aspirant? Determine, of
what use? 
Of what use?


 


9) Even if I find in my possession precious stones or pearls and well
decorated and dressed lovable bride, yet if my mind is not absorbed in devotion
to the lotus feet of the Guru, of what use is any other possession?


 


10) Whoever reads, studies and recites this collection of eight verses
on Guru and remains devoted and attentive to the sayings of the Guru, he, no
matter if he is a holy person, ascetic, king, neophyte, or householder, attains
his coveted object, namely the supreme abode of Brahman, the unassailable seat
of immortality.
