TRANSLATION


1) Oh mind, why do you give
such importance to mundane knowledge? Your discussion and deliberation on the 
smrti
 scriptures, various languages and grammar certainly
increases the sweet fragrant aroma of your own material reputation, name and
fame.


 


2) But just look here and
consider this for your judgment. If you have not worshiped Lord 
Hari
, then all of you so-called knowledge is just like a
vicious hell. True devotional service actually takes its birth from the seed of
attraction and affection for 
Krsna
. Such a seed is
impossible to get by the cultivation of ordinary worldly knowledge.


 


3) I feel that the hair-splitting
scrutiny of mundane knowledge is actually harmful. On the other hand, however,
everyone will appreciate the cultivation of that transcendental knowledge which
awakens love and attachment for 
Krsna
 within the
mind.


 


4) Among all the obstacles
to devotion, this mundane knowledge is certainly the foremost. You must
sincerely kick it out, dear mind, for the real understanding is that Mother 
Sarasvati
, the Goddess of learning, is very dear to Lord 
Krsna
, and devotion to Him is her very heart. This very
devotion is indeed the sanctifying grace of 
Bhaktivinoda
.
