TRANSLATION


1)
A sober person who can tolerate the urge to speak, the mind's demands, the
actions of anger and the urges of the tongue, belly and genitals is qualified
to make disciples all over the world.


 


2)
One's devotional service is spoiled when he becomes too entangled in the
following six activities: (1) eating more than necessary or collecting more
funds than required; (2) over-endeavoring for mundane things that are very
difficult to obtain; (3) talking unnecessarily about mundane subject matters;
(4) Practicing the scriptural rules and regulations only for the sake of
following them and not for the sake of spiritual advancement, or rejecting the
rules and regulations of the scriptures and working independently or
whimsically; (5) associating with worldly-minded persons who are not interested
in Krsna consciousness; and (6) being greedy for mundane achievements.


 


3)
There are six principles favorable to the execution of pure devotional service:
(1) being enthusiastic, (2) endeavoring with confidence, (3) being patient, (4)
acting according to regulative principles (such as sravanam kirtanam visnoh
̣
 smaranam [SB 7.5.23] Â— hearing, chanting and
remembering Krsna), (5) abandoning the association of nondevotees, and (6)
following in the footsteps of the previous acaryas. These six principles
undoubtedly assure the complete success of pure devotional service.


 


4)
Offering gifts in charity, accepting charitable gifts, revealing one's mind in
confidence, inquiring confidentially, accepting prasada and offering prasada
are the six symptoms of love shared by one devotee and another.


 


5)
One should mentally honor the devotee who chants the holy name of Lord Krsna,
one should offer humble obeisances to the devotee who has undergone spiritual
initiation [diksa] and is engaged in worshiping the Deity, and one should
associate with and faithfully serve that Pure devotee who is advanced in
undeviated devotional service and whose heart is completely devoid of the
propensity to criticize others.


 


6)
Being situated in his original Krsna conscious position, a pure devotee does
not identify with the body. Such a devotee should not be seen from a
materialistic point of view. Indeed, one should overlook a devotee's having a
body born in a low family, a body with a bad complexion, a deformed body, or a
diseased or infirm body. According to ordinary vision, such imperfections may
seem prominent in the body of a pure devotee, but despite such seeming defects,
the body of a pure devotee cannot be polluted. It is exactly like the waters of
the Ganges, which sometimes during the rainy season are full of bubbles, foam
and mud. The Ganges waters do not become polluted. Those who are advanced in
spiritual understanding will bathe in the Ganges without considering the
condition of the water.


 


7)
The holy name, character, pastimes and activities of Krsna are all
transcendentally sweet like sugar candy. Although the tongue of one afflicted
by the jaundice of avidya [ignorance] cannot taste anything sweet, it is
wonderful that simply by carefully chanting these sweet names every day, a
natural relish awakens within his tongue, and his disease is gradually
destroyed at the root.


 


8)
The essence of all advice is that one should utilize one's full time Â—
twenty-four hours a day Â— in nicely chanting and remembering the Lord's divine
name, transcendental form, qualities and eternal pastimes, thereby gradually
engaging one's tongue and mind. In this way one should reside in Vraja [Goloka
Vr
̣
ndavana dhama] and serve Krsna
under the guidance of devotees. One should follow in the footsteps of the
Lord's beloved devotees, who are deeply attached to His devotional service.


 


9)Â 
The holy place known as Mathura is spiritually superior to Vaikuntha, the
transcendental world, because the Lord appeared there. Superior to Mathura-Puri
is the transcendental forest of Vr
̣
ndavana because of Krsna's rasa-lila
pastimes. And superior to the forest of Vr
̣
ndavana is Govardhana Hill, for
it was raised by the divine hand of Sri Krsna and was the site of His various
loving pastimes. And, above all, the superexcellent Sri Radha-kunda stands
supreme, for it is overflooded with the ambrosial nectarean prema of the Lord
of Gokula, Sri Krsna. Where, then, is that intelligent Person who is unwilling
to serve this divine Radha-kunda, which is situated at the foot of Govardhana
Hill?


 


10)
In the sastra it is said that of all types of fruitive workers, he who is
advanced in knowledge of the higher values of life is favored by the Supreme
Lord Hari. Out of many such people who are advanced in knowledge [jnanis], one
who is practically liberated by virtue of his knowledge may take to devotional
service. He is superior to the others. However, one who has actually attained
prema, pure love of Krsna, is superior to him. The gopis are exalted above all
the advanced devotees because they are always totally dependent upon Sri Krsna,
the transcendental cowherd boy. Among the gopis, Srimati Radharani is the most
dear to Krsna. Her kunda [lake] is as profoundly dear to Lord Krsna as this
most beloved of the gopis. Who, then, will not reside at Radha-kunda and, in a
spiritual body surcharged with ecstatic devotional feelings [aprakr
̣
tabhava], render loving service to the divine
couple Sri Sri Radha-Govinda, who perform Their astakaliya-lila, Their eternal
eightfold daily pastimes. Indeed, those who execute devotional service on the
banks of Radha-kunda are the most fortunate people in the universe.


 


11)
Of the many objects of favored delight and of all the lovable damsels of
Vrajabhūmi, Srimati Radharani is certainly the most treasured object of Krsna's
love. And, in every respect, Her divine kunda is described by great sages as
similarly dear to Him. Undoubtedly Radha-kunda is very rarely attained even by
the great devotees; therefore it is even more difficult for ordinary devotees
to attain. If one simply bathes once within those holy waters, one's pure love
of Krsna is fully aroused.
