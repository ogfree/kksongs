TRANSALATION


1) I will not
hear other talk.  I will not speak other talk.  I will speak about
the most precious thing.  I always pray for this.  Aside from the talk
I yearn to hear, all other words are useless.


 


2) How can I
describe the Supreme Personality of Godhead?  He is limitless.  Who
can know Him?  The love the people of Vraja feel for Lord Krsna is
eternal.  It is the true reality.  Always strive to attain that love.


 


3) Lord Krsna
is the pleasure of the cows, land and senses, the moon of Gokula, and the root
of transcendental bliss.  He stays with many gopa and gopi friends. 
His home is Nandisvara, and His name is Giridhari.  Please, in the company
of the gopis, worship Him with love.


 


4) O brother,
the truth of loving devotional service has already been explained to you. 
O brother, I will leave all material desires behind and, by my guru's mercy I
will perfectly worship Lord Krsna with pure love, and I will become His
gopi-maidservant.


 


5) Follow the
path of sincere devotional service.  Stay among the devotees. 
Remember Krsna and talk about Him.  When loving devotion comes, your mind
will become pure and all sufferings will flee from your heart.


 


6) Know that
sense happiness is a calamity.  Know that the material world is a
dream.  Know that this human life is the root from which devotional
service may sprout.  With love always worship Lord Krsna.  With love
always hear His pastimes.  To do anything else is to plunge a spear in
your own heart.


 


7) If one
decorates his body with the dust from Srimati Radharani's lotus feet, then it
will be very easy for him to attain Lord Giridhari.  I congratulate such a
great soul who takes shelter of Srimati Radharani's lotus feet and I say to
him" Well done! Bravo! Excellent!


 


8) Glory,
glory to She who is named Radha, whose home is Vrndavana, and who is Lord
Krsna's treasury of blissful pastimes!  Alas, destiny has cheated me, for
my ears have not heard Radha's glories.


 


9) A person
who, in the company of the devotees, again and again hears the stories of the
pure love in the rasa-dance pastimes will attain Lord Krsna, who is dark as a
monsoon cloud.  A person averse to hearing these pastimes will never
attain perfection.  I refuse to hear the name of such an offender.


 


10) O brother,
by chanting Krsna's name I will attain Radha, and by chanting Radha's name I
will attain Krsna.  Now I have briefly told you how to chase all
sufferings from your heart.  What contradicts my words will bring only
pain.


 


11) Abandon
false ego, pride, company with materialists, and useless material knowledge,
and worship the lotus feet of your spiritual master.  Offer your home,
friends, relatives, body and self to him.  His words are supreme.


 


12) Always
serve Sri Krsna Caitanyadeva, who is a kalpa-vrksa tree giving away the
treasure of pure love.  He is Lord Krsna Himself, the prince of Vraja and
the life of Srimati Radharani.  Talk about Him is full of wonder.


 


13) Accepting
the loving emotions of Sri Radha and accepting Her bodily lustre as the
ornament of His limbs, Lord Krsna descended to Navadvipa.  Desiring to
attain three things, He appear in Saci's womb.  He attained His desires in
the company of His devotees.


 


14) Appearing
in a fair-complexioned form, He made a great monsoon of spiritual love. 
In this way He attained His three desires.  Why did Lord Krsna, the master
of Radha, cry again and again?  Only the devotees can know.


 


15) In private
I will practice the nine kinds of devotional service and in this way I will
attain perfection.  I will always humbly pray for that.  In public I
will perform Hari-sankirtana, my heart overcome with love.  Any activity
that does not lead to My worshipable Lord is an obstacle.


 


16) When
arrested by the highwaymen of material illusion, bound about the neck with
ropes of lust, and about to take his last breath, the devotee of Lord Hari
calls out for the Lord's help and is saved.  O devotees, call out in this
way, glorifying the nectar topics of pure love for Krsna.  Then the
calamity of repeated birth and death will come to an end.


 


17) Hundreds
and hundreds of women, children and other relatives will someday die. 
Take care of yourself.  I, who am very fallen, am already killed by sense
gratification.  I would not worship Lord Hari's feet.  Now I have no
protection.


 


18) I desire
the association of Ramcandra Kaviraja.  Without his company the entire
world is a desert.  If I must take birth again, I would feel myself
fortunate to have his association.


 


19) I will not
describe the specific devotional activities of each devotee.  Perform your
devotional service carefully.  Don't become angry.  Don't find fault
with others.  Offer obeisances to the devotees' feet.


 


20) Sri
Gauranga Mahaprabhu has enabled me to write these words.  Without His
mercy I am simply a fool who cannot distinguish right from wrong.


 


21) In his
heart aspiring to attain the mercy of Srila Lokanatha Gosvami Prabhupada,
Narottama dasa speaks this book, Sri Prema-bhakti-candrika (The Moonlight of
Loving Devotion).
