LYRICS:


(1)


I bow
before Lord Krsnacandra's feet,


Feet
filled with endless splendor and with grace,


Feet
even learned thinkers cannot trace,


Feet
with every happiness complete,


 


(2)


Feet
with glorious nectar always sweet,


Feet
bhaktas in their thoughts always embrace,


Feet
that are the bhaktas garden place,


And
these words I with broken voice repeat:


 


(3)


O
master master take me from this world 


So
cruelly fenced about by birth and death,


A
world where with a broken heart I live,


 


(4)


A
world of thorns of poison arrows hurled,


A
world so marred with battle at every breath,


And at
Your feet to me a shelter give.
