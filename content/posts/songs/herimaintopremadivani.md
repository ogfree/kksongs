TRANSLATION


(Refrain:) Oh 
oh
! I'm love-crazy. No one knows my pain.



1) My bed is over the gallows. How could I sleep? My lover's bed is in heaven's

mandala
. How could I get to him? 






2) The one who is wounded
knows what a wound means, what it means to be burned. The jeweler knows what it
means to be a jeweler, what it means to have a jewel.






3) Afflicted by pain, I
wander from forest to forest. I cannot get a doctor O Lord, Mira's torment will
be wiped out when the doctor is the Dark Lover.
