TRANSLATION


1)
O 
Krsna
, You drank the breast-milk of the cows and 
gopis
, and their love for 
You

increased more and more. In this way 
You
 bewildered
Lord Brahma, although Lord Brahma clearly understood (that the boys and calves
were all Your expansions).


 


2)
O 
Krsna
, revealing that each of these forms was 
Your
 own spiritual form, You caused Lord Brahma to become
greatly amazed. Lord Brahma felt helpless, and he awakened (to a proper
understanding of 
Krsna's
 status).


 


3)
O 
Krsna
, within Yourself You considered Lord Brahma
to be very insignificant, although externally 
You

tried to please him. O Lord, who appears like a charming cowherd boy holding a 
morsal
 of food in 
Your
 hand,
please protect me.


 


4)
O 
Krsna
, seeing that new boys and calves were created,
Lord Brahma became embarrassed. Understanding the truth about You, He glorified

You
 by offering prayers, and he washed Your lotus feet
with His tears of joy.
