milā do
śyāma se udhau tere guṇa ham bhī gāeńge

mukuṭa sira
mora-pańkha kā, makara kuṇḍala hai kānoń

phir kabhī
āye gokula meń hameń daraśana dilā denā


voh brahmānanda
kahe dil se, nahīń unako bhulāeńge


 


TRANSLATION


Refrain:
O Udhau, please introduce us to Syama! We will even sing your glories!


 


1)
Ever since you have left Gokula, you have never returned back! What fault did
we do? Please accept our humble plea!


 


2)
He is adorned with a crown with a peacock feather on His head and wears
earrings shaped like sharks on His ears. Looking at His ever-enchanting form
excites our hearts!


 


3)
After giving us love, the son of Nanda Maharaja abandons us! LetÂ’s go and apply
our heads to His lotus feet to beg and reason with Him!


 


4)
If You ever plan on coming to Gokula, please appear before us! The poet
Brahmananda says from his heart that he can never forget Him!


 


REMARKS/EXTRA
INFORMATION:


This
bhajan is popularized by Lokanath Swami in his album Â“Amrut Dhara.Â” It was
rendered in Raga Kalavati in Kaherva Tala. It can also be rendered in Raga
Yaman Kalyana.


 


There
are some variations to this bhajan. 


 


For
Verse 1, Â“
hama ko choḍ
giradhārī, gae jaba se nahīń āye.
Â” The meaning
is Â“O Giridhari! Ever since You have left us, you have never returned back!Â”


 


For
Verse 3, Â“prīta lāgakaraÂ” vs. Â“sneha lagakāra:Â” The meaning is
still the same as the translation above.
