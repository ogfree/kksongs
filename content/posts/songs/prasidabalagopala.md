TRANSLATION


1)
O Krsna, O little cowherd boy, O delight of the 
gopis
,
O performer of mischievous childhood pastimes in the company of 
Your
 like-minded friends of the same age, please be merciful
to me.


 


2)
O Krsna, releasing the calves at the wrong time, 
You

smiled to see the residents of 
Vraja
 lament. You
would continually steal butter, and also feed it to the monkeys.


 


3)
O Krsna, entering the darkened store-room, making a staircase of the bench and
the grinding mortar and pulling the ropes 
You
 broke
the pots full of milk-products.


 


4)
O Krsna, Your limbs are illuminated with glistening jewels. Hearing the harsh
complaints of the 
gopis
, 
You

became frightened and Your eyes moved restlessly. In this condition 
You
 gave great delight to Mother 
Yasoda
.


 


5)
O Krsna, O Source of the devoteeÂ’s bliss, When Lord 
Balarama

and Your other friends reported to Mother 
Yasoda
 that
You had eaten clay, considering it very palatable foodstuff, 
whe
 reprimanded You very severely, thinking of Your
welfare.


 


6)
O Krsna, moving 
Your
 eyes with pretended fear, You hid
among Your friends. Denying the accusations of Lord 
Balarama

and the others 
You
 vowed to Mother 
Yasoda

that You were innocent.


 


7)
O Krsna, You opened 
Your
 small lotus mouth showed the
entire universe to Mother 
Yasoda
, She then understood
Your transcendental opulence, although You again cast on illusion her by Your
potency. All glories unto 
You
. 


 


8)
O Krsna, in this way 
You
 increased the love of Mother 
Yasoda
, who affectionately embraced You. Because 
You
 fulfilled the benediction offered by Lord Brahma to Your
devotees 
Drona
 and 
Dhara
,
(they were able to become Your parents).
