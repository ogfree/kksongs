TRANSLATION


1) Dark 
Krsna

and beautiful 
Radha
 have combined in a single fair
form. This truth the common people doubt.


 


2) That fragrant form
contains the sweetest nectar. That form is like a tree filled with ripe fruits.


 


3) He who previously took
birth as a 
gopa
 has now descended as a 
brahmana
 to this world. Even the Vedas do not understand
Him. His pastimes are very confidential. 


 


4) He openly revealed the
chanting of Lord 
Hari's
 holy names. Now no other
sound is heard from any man's or woman's mouth.


 


5) Tasting the sweet nectar
at the lotus flower of Lord 
Gaura's
 feet, 
Madhavi
 
dasa
 sings this sweet
song.
