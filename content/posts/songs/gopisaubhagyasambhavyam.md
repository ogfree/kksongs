TRANSLATION


1) O Beautiful-eyed Lord 
Krsna
 You 
are
 the auspiciousness
of the 
gopis
. Your hair is tied with a 
sumana
 flower and a peacock feather and it is covered with
the dust upraised by the walking of the cows.


 


2) O 
Krsna
,
I offer respectful 
obeisances
 unto 
You
.
You appear very handsome, shyly smiling and casting secret side-long glances
(to the 
gopis
). Your appearance enchants the 
gopis
. You are very affectionate to them and 
You
 arouse their love for You.


 


3) O 
Krsna
,
after mother 
Yasoda
 has bathed 
You
,
a garland of lotus flowers is placed on Your head like a crown. A necklace of
pearls decorates 
Your
 splendid throat and Your hands
appear very beautiful, decorated with bracelets. All glories unto 
You
.


 


4) O 
Krsna
,
You are decorated with tinkling bells and golden ornaments, a splendid garland
and a sweet fragrance. 
you
 eat the food offered to You
by Mother 
Yasoda
.


 


5) O 
Krsna
,
as a little child 
You
 would charmingly and playfully
smile and glance about with playful pride. You would happily go to bed, and 
Srimati
 
Radharani
 would please 
You
 with her bantering conversation.
