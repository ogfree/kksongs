TRANSLATION


1)
Oh my dear mind! What shall I say to you now? All my time has been spent inside
the deep pit of 
fruitive
 activities. With high hopes
of future happiness in the heavenly planets, I have fallen into the trap of 
fruitive
 actions and reaction, which is exactly like the
entangling web of a spider.


 


2)
Observing many different types of austere vows and fasting to achieve some
future heavenly goal, I thus performed such useless physical labor for no real
tangible result. This was just like pouring oblations of ghee onto dry ashes
only. Now I am being strangled within the noose of karma, being destroyed by my
own foolish nonsense. And the only result is that I have not been able to
deliver myself from this predicament.


 


3)
I conducted many sacrifices in honor of many different demigods and goddesses,
as is recommended for householders in the 
varnasrama
-dharma
system. But by doing this I only became so puffed up that I wasted my whole
life in such delirious pride. I never got any peace of mind by doing all this,
for I completely missed out on the golden treasure of spiritual satisfaction.
So much trouble I underwent because I never worshiped the beautiful lotus feet
of Sri Krsna!


 


4)
Therefore to hell with my whole life! To hell with all my wealth and followers!
To hell with my caste-pride! To hell with all my so-called dignity of family
prestige! To hell with my studies of the karma-
khanda

scriptures, for I have not become fixed up in pure devotion to Lord 
Hari
!
