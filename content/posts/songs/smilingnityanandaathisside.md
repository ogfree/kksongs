LYRICS:


(1)


Smiling 
Nityananda

at His side,


Lord 
Caitanya

dances in the street.


Of 
Navadvipa
.

Now His graceful wide


Open eyes are blossoming lotus
flowers His feet


 


(2)


Bless the path His tall and
sweet and fair


Form gently moves with
endless charming grace.


On every side around Him
now the air


Is filled with His own holy
names His face


 


(3)


Is splendid like a million
moons His hands


Are raised above His head 
Now
 a great host


Of 
bhaktas

follows close behind Gold bands 


Glisten on His waving arms 
A
 most


 


(4)


Glorious splendor fills His
every limb.


I offer my 
obeisances
 to Him.
