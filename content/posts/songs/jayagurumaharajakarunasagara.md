TRANSLATION


1) If we want to do
anything we must firstly go to 
Gurudeva
. So we are
giving '
jaya
' to 
Gurudeva

and taking his permission. Our 
Srila
 Guru 
Maharaj
 is 
Srila
 
Bhakti
 
Raksak
 Sridhar Dev-
Goswami
 and I am giving '
jaya
' to
His Divine Grace.


 


2) '
Nilachala
'
means 
Puri
 
Dham
. There in 
Puri
 
Dham
, both 
Nitai
 and 
Chaitanyadeva
 are
manifested by the divine mercy of 
Srila
 Guru 
Maharaj
 and 
Their
 service is going
on continuously.


 


3) Then 
comes

the glorification of those personalities who are living on the 
simhasan
 (altar). First is the glorification of 
Nityananda
 
Prabhu
, because by the
grace of 
Nityananda
 
Prabhu

we will get the mercy of Lord 
Chaitanya
 
Mahaprabhu
. We are saying 
Nitai-Chaitanya
,
and it is very appropriate because 
Nityananda
 
Prabhu
 is the form of Sri 
Gurudeva

and also without His mercy we will not get the mercy of 
Chaitanya


Mahaprabhu
. Sometimes we are saying 
Chaitanya-Nitai
 but normally 
Nitai-Chaitanya
.
Both are standing there and giving 
Their
 merciful glance
to the conditioned souls. One form is in the intoxicated, dancing mood of 
Nityananda
 
Prabhu
, always giving
the fearless spiritual wealth by which we will be benefited. Happily we can 
practise
 that. The mood of 
Nityananda


Prabhu
, with His right hand up and left hand giving
merciful blessings is the mood that fearlessly you will do service. And 
Mahaprabhu
 is also present there, but in the form of 
Rasaraja
 and 
Mahabhava
. Actually 
Mahaprabhu's
 form is Krishna Himself taking the heart and
halo of 
Radharani
 and becoming 
Chaitanyadeva
.
Then 
Rasaraja
 is actually 
Krishna
 and 
Mahabhava
 is 
Radharani
.

Krishna
 and 
Radharani
 are both
there within one, and that is 
Chaitanya-svarupa
, 
Mahaprabhu
. And His manifestation we are seeing in the 
simhasan
.


 


4) Both are standing
effulgent like gold. When gold is cut with a sharp knife its effulgence comes
out more and more. Their golden form is like that, fully effulgent. 
Garlands
 of different beautiful flowers are there and those
garlands are playing on the necks of 
Nitai-Chaitanyadeva
.


 


5) If anyone will see that
divine form of 
Nitai-Chaitanyadeva
 he will faint with
transcendental feelings. They are dancing in the mood of bestowing mercy,
touching the hearts of everyone and inconceivably giving mercy to the
conditioned souls in an unconditional way.


 


6) 
Nitai-Chaitanyadeva


are
 like the morning sun and the full moon but our
vision is covered. If we look with clean, devotional eyes, full of love and
affection, then we can see 
Their
 divine form. And for
this vision, we need good fortune which comes through the mercy of the 
Vaisnavas
. Then with 
sadhu-sanga
,
association of the 
Vaisnavas
 and their merciful
glance, we can see that divine form.


 


7) Here is an ornamental
expression. When this type of 
arati
 comes and we
stand in front of 
Nitai-Chaitanyadeva
 and do the 
arati
, what do we do? We play the 
mrdanga

and the 
karatals
 and we blow the conch. Externally it
happens but also internally. With the 
panchapati
, the
ghee lamp with 108 wicks, we are doing 
arati
.
Externally we are doing this and internally we shall try to see that each lamp
of that 
arati
,
 is not only a lamp but it is the Vedas. The different
parts of the Vedas that are 
existing
 within 
bhakti
-yoga have taken form in each lamp as a 
bhakti
-yoga lamp. The 108 Upanishads and all others are
taking this form and worshipping the Lord through that 
arati
.


 


8) Anyone who will look
with 
prema
 
netra
 (eyes of
love) will see love, real love and affection, and they will be extremely
charmed. Only those who are living in Gupta 
Vrindavan

can see with that type of vision. Gupta 
Vrindavan

means 
Nabadwip
 
Dham
. Those
who are living in 
Nabadwip
 
Dham

are always looking at that 
arati
 of 
Nitai
 
Chaitanyadeva
. Every day
this 
arati
 is performed and by the grace of 
Srila
 Guru 
Maharaj
 this property
of 
Nabadwip
 has come to 
Puri


Dham
 to bestow its mercy on the conditioned souls.


 


9) This type of 
Arati
 is only seen by the 
Nabadwip


Dhambasis
, the 
parshadas

(associates) of 
Sriman
 
Mahaprabhu
,
and those who are very affectionate with 
Mahaprabhu
, 
Chaitanyadeva
. His associates, Sri 
Svarupa


Damodara
, 
Ramananda
 
Raya
, 
Rupa
 
Goswami
,

Sanatana
 
Goswami
, 
Raghunatha
 
Das
 
Goswami
, 
Haridas
 
Thakur
 and 
Gadadhara
 
Pandit
 are performing this 
arati

and seeing this 
arati
.


 


10) 
Sarvabhauma

Bhattacharyya, 
Gopinath
 
Acharyya

and 
Jivanugajana
, those who are living in the 
sampradaya
 of 
Jiva
 
Goswami
, they are all glorifying that 
arati
,
looking at that 
arati
 and doing that 
arati
. It is very easy for them to do this but it is very
difficult for others.


 


11) We are so fortunate
that the 
arati
 of 
Gauranga

and 
Nityananda
 is very famous in 
Nabadwip


Dham
, where 
Nityananda
 
Prabhu
 and 
Mahaprabhu
 are present
eternally. But in 
patitapavanaksetra
, 
Puri
 
Dham
, it has been mercifully
given by our fortune-maker, Sri 
Gurudeva
.


 


12) '
Avichintya
'
means inconceivable. This type of 
arati
 can only be
conceived by a very fortunate soul. He can see it and can also do that 
arati
 if he has received the mercy of 
Srila


Gurudeva
. Through the mercy of 
Gurudeva

anyone can see this type of manifestation of 
Nitai-Chaitanyadeva

and Their 
arati
, and can join within that 
sankirttan
.


 


Remarks/ Extra Information
: 


This
is the 
Nitai
 
Caitanya
 
arati
 to glorify Sri 
Sri
 
Nitai
 
Caitanya
 in 
Jagannatha
 
Puri
.
