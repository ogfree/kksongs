TRANSLATION


1)
My dear mind, why do you have all these skeptical doubts? You despise the
material world just to facilitate your merging into Brahman, but you are afraid
to worship 
Hari
, the Lord of ecstatic love, for fear
of perceiving your own eternal, spiritual form.


 


2)
This fear is due to your thinking that everything is made of Brahman. You imagine
that if you were to meditate on your eternal spiritual form, that sometime
later you may become influenced by forms made of the material energy. Therefore
you are convinced that the Absolute is without any form, spotlessly pure,
all-pervading, eternal and formless.


 


3)
And now, swayed under the influence of this non-ecstatic philosophy, your
actual blissful spiritual nature has not entered your heart. Therefore your
so-called impersonal Brahman realization has actually short-changed you from
your true ecstasy, and thus you simply remain in scarcity for want of true
love. Renouncing this logical jugglery, just take shelter of beautiful
moon-like 
Krsna
, who is the ecstatic manifestation of
supreme bliss.


 


4)
In comparison to the impersonal Brahman, Lord 
Krsna's

original personal form is composed of eternity, knowledge and bliss. He is the
reservoir and source of pleasure and sweetness for all living entities. He is
the complete form of beauty at all places and at all times. These are some of
His special, wonderful characteristics. None of these wonderful qualities can
be found in the impersonal Brahman.


 


5)
Therefore I now declare that the Brahman effulgence is actually the
transcendental effulgence of Lord 
Krsna's
 body; it is
His extremely vast ant extensive aura. He who is the Brahman, and above that,
the 
Prabrahman
, is the original form of Lord Sri 
Krsna
, for whom 
Bhaktivinoda
 has
love and affection.
