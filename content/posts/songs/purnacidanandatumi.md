TRANSLATION


1)
The dead son continued: "You, dear Lord, are completely full in
transcendental bliss. I am simply a tiny conscious particle of 
You
; therefore by nature I am Your eternal servant. Only 
You
 are supremely independent, 
whereasI

am totally dependent on You. Indeed, neglecting 
Your

lotus feet, I have now become completely ruined."


 


2)
"As soon as I chose to be independent of Your Lordship, I became inclined
toward 
maya's
 illusory benefits. Thus I have given up
my natural spiritual characteristics. Falling down due to the dazzling
bewilderment of 
fruitive
 gain, I have become captured
by 
maya
 within this mundane world. Now as a result I
am being forcibly thrown into the revolving wheel of binding 
fruitive
 actions and reactions."


 


3)
"Thus I am bound up by Maya in this world according to 
Your

will, being firmly clenched in the iron-like grip of my predestined fate. And
according to this fate, I have now come into 
Srivasa's

home by taking birth as the son of 
Malini
."


 


4)
"Now, again according to my predestined fate, I must leave this place; I
cannot remain here any longer, even if I wanted to. Your desire is most
powerful, dear Lord, whereas my desire is most feeble, for I am simply an
insignificant, humble soul."


 


5)
"Wherever 
You
 send me next, oh Lord, I must
certainly go to become someone's son or husband or father. However, I know that
all these material relationships do not possess even one speck of eternal
truth, for only 
You
, dear Lord, are the eternal friend
and guardian of all souls."


 


6)
"Only one who foolishly neglects the eternal shelter of 
You

two lotus feet considers the union and separation of all these temporary family
relationships to be separation of all distress. This just shows how much one
has actually become absorbed in the bodily concept of life, being crammed and
stuffed into the womb of illusion." Hearing all these truths about the
fate of the bound soul has now made 
Bhaktivinoda

become extremely frightened.
