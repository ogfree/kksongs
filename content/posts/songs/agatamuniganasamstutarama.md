TRANSLATION


1) O
Rama, Who was praised by the assembly of visiting sages! O Rama, Who heard the
story of the birth and rise of Ravana! O Rama, Who was pleased by the loving
embrace of Sīta! O Rama, Who protected the subjects with authority!


 


2) O
Rama, Who abandoned Sīta, the progeny of Janaka, to the forest (due to
false rumors created by the people of Ayodhya)! O Rama, Who arranged for the
death of Lavanasura! O Rama, Who was worshipped by heaven resident Sambuka! O
Rama, Who was delighted by His sons Kusa and Lava!


 


3) O
Rama, Who performed the Asvamedha Yajna (sacrifice)! O Rama, Who was
communicated to Yamaraja of His return to His divine abode! O Rama, Who
provided liberation to the people of Ayodhya! O Rama, Who gave bliss to
demigods led by Brahma!


 


4) O
Rama, Whose form is full of brilliance! O Rama, Who is the liberator from the
bondage of birth and death! O Rama, eager to establish eternal religious
principles and duties! O Rama, Who is the provider of liberation to those with
a devotional attitude as the ultimate resort!


 


5) O
Rama, Who nourishes all entities, animate and inanimate! O Rama, Who is the
remover of all diseases of the world! O Rama, Who settled in his abode of
Vaikuntha! O Rama, who is Nityananda!


 


6)
Rama Rama! All glories to King Rama! Rama Rama! All glories to Sita Rama!
