TRANSLATION


1) O Krsna, when the beauty
of the monsoon season decorated the forest, You performed pastimes in the caves
and under the large forest-trees, eating their fruits and roots.


 


2) O Krsna, I offer
respectful obeisances unto You. Sitting on a stone and eating Your lunch of
rice and yogurt, You and Your cowherd friends are delighted by the autumn
rains. Nourishing the fresh grasses, those rains worship You with their
manifestation of charming beauty.


 


3) O Krsna, please be
merciful unto me. The beautiful luster of Your form is like the clear autumn
sky and Your face is like the splendid autumn moon. You have become the supreme
cupid for the gopis.


 


REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:


This
song is based on Srimad Bhagavatam Canto 10 Chapter 20.
