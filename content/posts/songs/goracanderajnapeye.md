TRANSLATION


1) Then the Lord ordered
the household members to bring the boy's body out into the courtyard, and they
immediately complied.


 


2) Then the merciful Lord 
Gaura
, Who removes the gloomy, dirty influence of the age
of Kali, began to question the body by saying, "Please tell 
Me
, my dear boy, whatever prompted you to leave here so
suddenly, thus giving up your loving father 
Srivasa
 
Pandita
?"


 


3) Being thus questioned by
the Lord, the soul again manifested in the dead body by the mercy of the Lord,
and he began to offer very nice prayers which were meant to be instructive to
all persons.


 


4) The dead boy said,
" My dear Lord, You are without a doubt the Supreme Absolute Truth,
unlimited and one without a second. Since 
You
 are the
Supremely energetic, all of Your transcendental energies are certainly
non-different from You."


 


5) "This
transcendental potency of 
Your
 manifests itself in
three different ways, and it assists in the performance of Your eternal
pastimes in different ways according to Your own sweet will."


 


6) "The original form
of the cognizant potency (cit-
sakti
) is manifesting 
Your
 eternal pastimes in the spiritual world, and just to
give You pleasure it becomes the pleasure-giving potency known as 
hladini
."


 


7) "Secondly, becoming
the 
jiva-sakti
, the potency produces the multitudes
of fine, conscious particles which make up the glowing effulgence of 
Your
 transcendental body. All of these souls are thus
manifest with a natural marginal characteristic of minute independence."


 


8) "Thirdly, becoming
the 
maya-sakti
, the potency crates the innumerable
material universes, and within them she captures and binds all the souls who
choose to remain averse to 
You
, dear Lord."


 


9) Hearing these prayers
offered to Lord 
Caitanya
 by the dead boy, 
Bhaktivinoda
 says at this point that he himself has also
become averse to the Lord due to his offences, and has become swallowed up by 
maya
 in the material world.
