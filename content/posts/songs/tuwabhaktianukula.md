TRANSLATION


1) I
will surely execute with utmost care those activities favorable to Your pure
devotional service.


 


2) I
will feel fondness for those things in this world which are conductive to pure
devotion, and with my senses I will engage them in Your service.


 


3) I
will carefully listen to all discussions concerning You, and the satisfaction
of my eyes will be to behold Your divine abode.


 


4) I
will nourish my body with the sacred remnants of Your food and smell the sweet
scent of tulasi leaves adorning those offerings.


 


5)
With my hands I will always execute Your service, and I will forever dwell at
that place where You abide.


 


6) I
will employ my desires in Your devotional service and show anger to those who
are envious of You.


 


7) In
this way may all of my propensities and emotions obtain dignity and glory by
being favorable to You.


 


8) I
will consider as favorable to Your devotional service anything I do which is
favorable to Your devotee.


 


9)
Bhaktivinoda knows neither religion nor irreligion. He simply prays that all
his activities be conductive for pure devotion to You.
