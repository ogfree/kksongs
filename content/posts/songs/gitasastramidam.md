TRANSLATION


1) If
one properly follows the instructions of Bhagavad-gita, one can be freed from
all the miseries and anxieties of life. One will be freed from all fears in
this life, and one's next life will be spiritual.


 


2) If
one reads Bhagavad-gita very sincerely and with all seriousness, then by the
grace of the Lord the reactions of his past misdeeds will not act upon him.


 


3)
 
One may cleanse himself daily by taking a bath in
water, but if one takes a bath even once in the sacred Ganges water of
Bhagavad-gita, for him the dirt of material life is altogether vanquished.


 


4)
Because Bhagavad-gita is spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one need
not read any other Vedic literature. One need only attentively and regularly
hear and read Bhagavad-gita. In the present age, people are so absorbed in
mundane activities that it is not possible for them to read all the Vedic
literatures. But this is not necessary. This one book, Bhagavad-gita, will
suffice, because it is the essence of all Vedic literatures and especially
because it is spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead.


 


5) One
who drinks the water of the Ganges attains salvation, so what to speak of one
who drinks the nectar of Bhagavad-gita? Bhagavad-gita is the essential nectar
of the Mahabharata, and it is spoken by Lord Krsna Himself, the original Visnu.


 


6)
This Gitopanisad, Bhagavad-gita, the essence of all the Upanisads, is just like
a cow, and Lord Krsna, who is famous as a cowherd boy, is milking this cow.
Arjuna is just like a calf, and learned scholars and pure devotees are to drink
the nectarean milk of Bhagavad-gita.


 


7) Let
there be one scripture only, one common scripture for the whole world Â—
Bhagavad-gita. Let there be one God for the whole world Â— Śri Krsna. Let
there be only one hymn, one mantra, one prayer Â— the chanting of His name: Hare
Krsna, Hare Krsna, Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama,
Hare Hare. Let there be one work only Â— the service of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead.
