TRANSLATION


(Refrain) Ah! Ah! What did
they say? 
Cheasting
 their elders with a host of
nectar lies, they went to meet 
Krsna
 in broad
daylight.


 


1) All the teenage 
gopis
 went to 
Vrndavana
 forest to
worship Goddess 
Durga
. Speaking sweet words, they
asked their elders' permission.


 


2) They dressed in nice
garments, talked with their sisters-in-law, and spoke clever words with their 
gopi
-friends. They declared all their desires would be
fulfilled by worshiping 
Durga
 and 
Ganesa
.


 


3) They brought with them
fragrances, flowers, camphor, betel nuts, and cups of sandal paste. 
Govinda
 
dasa
 took care no
brambles blocked their path.


 


REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:


This
song was sung in Raga
