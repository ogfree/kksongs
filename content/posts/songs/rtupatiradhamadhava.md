TRANSLATION


1)

Radha
 and 
Madhava
 play
different 
rasika
 pastimes in the king of seasons
(spring), like 
Holi
. Thus 
Syama's

body is reddened by 
abira
 powder.


 


2)

Rai
 saw 
Her
 own reflection
in 
Syama's
 reddened mirror-like body and mistook this
for another woman. Thus 
She
 became angry with 
Syama
 and lost interest in Him.


 


3)
Seeing 
Rai's
 pique, 
Rasika
 
Sunagara
 (the relishing great lover 
Krsna
)
prayed to 
Her
 with folded hands. 
Pitambara

thus humbly fell at 
Her
 feet, but 
Rai

turned Her head away from Him.


 


4)
No matter how much the 
priya
 
sakhis

try to make 
Rai
 understand what had happened - They
came for happiness, but 
They
 received just the
opposite. 
Dvija
 
Haridas

says: "Pique is a part of the ways of love.Â”


 


REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:


This
song is sung in Raga
