TRANSLATION


1) How
has one such as I come to Your shelter? Surely it is by Your mercy alone, for
You are everseeking the purification and deliverance of the fallen souls.


 


2) You
are my only hope, for You are full of compassion and mercy. There is no one who
needs Your mercy more than I. You will surely drive away all fear.


 


3) No
one else has the power to deliver me. O merciful Lord, by Your declaration,
kindly deliver this vile and lowly sinner.


 


4) I
have given up everything and come to Your lotus feet. I am Your eternal
servant, and You are my protector and maintainer, O Lord of the universe!


 


5)
Everything is Yours. I am merely a servant, certain that You will deliver me. I
have chosen Your lotus feet as my only shelter. I no longer belong to myself.


 


6)
Weeping, Bhaktivinoda takes shelter at Your feet. Forgive his offenses, afford
him a taste for the holy name, and kindly maintain him.
