TRANSLATION


Refrain: O mind! Pure love
is the essence of all. The worshipper of love is 
Srimati


Radharani
 and 
Krsna
 is the
incarnation of love.


 


1) Love is the LordÂ’s
flute. Love is the 
Yamuna
 River. Love is the Divine
Couple, 
Radha
 and 
Krsna
!
Their intense love for each other awakens the aspiration for His love. The soul
thatÂ’s drowned in love will praise the power of love.


 


2) While traveling on the
path of love, one reaches the river of devotional service. The river of
devotional service merges into the ocean of love. The two ends of the river of
devotional service are love.


 


REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:


This
song was featured in the 
Shri
 Krishna serial.
