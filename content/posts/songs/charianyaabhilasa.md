TRANSLATION


1)

Srila
 
Rupa
 
Gosvami
, after intensely studying all the devotional
scriptures, has made the following conclusive definition of pure devotional
service: Giving up all desires for 
fruitive
 reward or
philosophical jugglery, one should execute favorable devotional service to
Krsna for his pleasure only.


 


2)
The divisions of regulated devotional service are: 1) hearing the glories of
the Lord, 2) chanting His holy names, 3) remembering Him within the core of the
heart, 4) serving His lotus feet, 5) worshiping His Deity form, 6) becoming His
menial servant, 7) offering prayers to Him revealing the mind, 8) entering into
a friendly relationship with Him, and 9) ultimately surrendering one's whole
existence in full dedication by mind, body and words. The practicing neophyte
devotees continuously perform all of these nine processes joyfully in the
association of saintly persons who are adept in hones devotional dedication.


 


3)
By the strength of the above-mentioned 
ninefold

practices of regulated devotional service, the devotion thereafter fructifies
into an ecstatic emotional service attitude, and after that one reawakens his
original pure ecstatic love of Godhead. In such transcendental love, the soul
whole-heartedly worships Krsna, constantly immersed in tasting the ecstatic
mellows of devotion to Him. This is the delicious mellow that 
Srila
 
Rupa
 
Gosvami

is teaching us about.
