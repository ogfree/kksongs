TRANSLATION


1) Alas, alas! When, oh
when will the two Brothers Gaura-Nitai show Themselves to this most fallen
person, thus exhibiting Their causeless mercy?


 


2) By the power of the mercy
of Them both, I will see the transcendental splendor of Vraja at Navadvipa. My
mind being charmed thus at my residence at Ananda-sukhada-kunja, I will behold
such wondrous thing with my very eyes.


 


3) Just nearby to my kutir
is Lalita-kunda, surrounded by hundreds and thousands of bejewelled altars. At
that place Sri Radha-Krsna can be seen, continuously sporting there as They
expand Their pastimes.


 


4) All of Their
confidential girlfriends are also there assisting the pastimes by performing
various services for the pleasure of Their Lordships. This maidservant is also
there, busy running here and there on the orders of the sakhis.


 


5) Stringing a garland of
malati flowers, I will bring it and place it into the hands of a sakhi. She
will place it around the necks of Sri Radha-Krsna, and I will dance, filled
with ecstasy.
