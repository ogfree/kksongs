LYRICS:


(1)


gopināth,
ghucāo saḿsāra jwālā

avidyā-jātanā, āro nāhi sahe,

janama-maraṇa-mālā


 


(2)


gopīnāth,
āmi to' kāmera dāsa

viṣaya-bāsanā, jāgiche hṛdoye,

phādiche karama phāsa


 


(3)


gopināth,
kabe vā jāgibo āmi

kāma-rūpa ari, dūre teyāgibo,

hṛdoye sphuribe tumi


 


(4)


gopīnāth,
āmi to' tomāra jana

tomāre chāriyā, saḿsāra bhajinu,

bhuliyā āpana-dhana


 


(5)


gopināth,
tumi to' sakali jāno

āpanāra jane, daṇḍiyā ekhano,

śrī-caraṇe deho sthāno


 


(6)


gopīnāth,
ei ki vicāra taba

bimukha dekhiyā, chāro nija-jane,

na koro' karuṇā-laba


 


(7)


gopīnāth,
āmi to mūrakha ati

kise bhālo hoya, kabhu nā bujhinu,

tāi heno mama gati


 


(8)


gopīnāth,
tumi to' paṇḍita-bara

mūḍhera mańgala, tumi anveṣibe,

e dāse nā bhāvo' para


 


WORD
FOR WORD TRANSLATION: 
Gopinath!
Ghucao Samsara Jwala


 


TRANSLATION



1) O
Gopinatha, please remove the torment of worldly existence. I can no longer
tolerate the pain of ignorance and the repeated succession of births and
deaths. 


 


2) O
Gopinatha, indeed I am a servant of lust. Worldly desires are awakening in my
heart, and thus the noose of fruitive work is beginning to tighten. 


 


3) O
Gopinatha, when will I wake up and abandon afar this enemy of lust, end when
will You manifest Yourself in my heart? 


 


4) O
Gopinatha, I am Your devotee, but having abandoned You and thus having forgotten
my real treasure, I have worshiped this mundane world. 


 


5)
O Gopinatha, You know everything. Now, having punished Your servant, please
give him a place at Your lotus feet. 


6) O
Gopinatha, is this Your judgment, that seeing me averse to You, You abandon
Your servant and don't bestow even a particle of mercy upon him? 


 


7) O
Gopinatha, I am certainly very foolish, and I have never known what is good for
me. Therefore such is my condition. 


 


8) O
Gopinatha, You are indeed the wisest person. Please look for a way to bring
about auspiciousness for this fool, and please do not consider this servant as
an outsider.
