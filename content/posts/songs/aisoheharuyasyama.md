TRANSLATION


Refrain: 'Come here, O 
Syama
 and play with 
Fagu
-powder with
us! If 
You
 win this fight I will make the whole world
sing Your glories."


 


1) "If 
You
 argue: "I'm all alone and You have so many
assistants", then let 
Visakha
 and her whole
group be on Your side."


 


2) O 
Lalita
,
My 
sakhi
, come and 
show
 us
how to play this again. Then 
You
 will know how this
game is played.


 


3) "If 
You
 say: "I have no colored powder", then take as
much of it as You want. It will not empower 
Your
 game
anyway."


 


4) "If 
You
 have no syringe, no problem, I can give You thousands of
them. O friend, take as many as 
You
 want."


 


5) "You bear the name 
Giridhari
 and the people call 
You

a hero Â– that reputation will now be shattered!"


 


6) "Hear Me, O 
rasika
 
Syama
! Save 
Your
 reputation by winning! Give the word and I will supply 
You
 with colored powder!"
