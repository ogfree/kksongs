TRANSLATION


1)
Overcome with ecstatic love, Lord Gaura dances. One moment He chants,
"Hari!" The next moment He is rapt in thinking of Vrndavana. Moment
after moment He accepts the mood of Sri Radha, the queen of Lord KrsnaÂ’s life. 


 


2)
A garment the color of yavaka is splendidly wrapped about His waist. Sometimes
He runs to the Ganga, declaring, "The Yamuna!" 


 


3)
The mridangas play, "Ta tha-i! Ta tha-i!" The kartalas plays
"Jhana jhana!" A Ganga of tears flows from Lord Gaura's lotus eyes. A
forest-garland swings to and fro on His neck. 


 


4)
Lord Gauracandra is the root of all bliss. He is very kind to the devotees, who
have no wealth but Him. Dina Krsna dasa yearns to attain the shade of His lotus
feet.
