TRANSLATION


1)
It was previously described how Vaikuntha was created by the sandhini aspect of
the spiritual potency of the superior energy. Vaikuntha is divided into three
divisionsÂ—the sweet division, the opulent division, and the impersonal
division. The impersonal division is the covering of Vaikuntha, the outer
apartment is called the abode of Narayana, and the inner apartment is called
Goloka. The impersonalists attain Brahma-dhama, the impersonal division, and
become free from lamentations caused by maya. The devotees who worship the
opulent aspect of the Lord attain Narayana-dhama and become fearless. The
devotees who worship the sweet aspect of the Lord attain the inner apartment
and relish the nectar of Krsna. Freedom from lamentation, fearlessness, and
nectar are the three-quarter opulences of the Lord known as Vaikuntha. When the
Supreme Lord is endowed with opulence, He is known as Vibhu. This material
world is the one-quarter opulence of Krsna. Various pastimes beginning with the
Lord's appearance and continuing to His disappearance are eternally manifested
in Goloka. The mood of Goloka is reflected in the conditioned living entities'
hearts, wherein the pastimes of Krsna are also eternally manifest. Therefore
according to the devotees' qualification, at a particular time Krsna is taking
birth in some devotee's heart, He is stealing the gopis' clothes in another
devotee's heart, He is performing the rasa dance in someone's heart, He is
killing Putana in another's heart, He is killing Kamsa in someone else's heart,
He is having an affair with Kubja in yet another's heart, and He enacts His
disappearance in the heart of some devotee who is leaving his body. As the
living entities are innumerable, the planets are also. As one pastime takes
place on one planet, another pastime takes place on another planet. In this way
each pastime continually takes place. Therefore all of the Lord's pastimes are
eternal; there is no break, because the Lord's energies are always active. All
these pastimes are purely spiritual, without a trace of material contamination.
Although for the conditioned living entities in illusion these pastimes appear
perverted, in reality they are most confidential and spiritual.


 


2)
These pastimes are constitutionally manifest in Goloka, but the conditioned
living entities perceive them in a relative way. A pastime appears different
because the nature of conditioned souls varies according to time, place, and
person. The pastimes of the Lord are never contaminated, but they may appear to
be due one's contaminated consideration. It was previously described that the
activities of the spiritual world are not clearly seen by conditioned souls.
Although something may be realized through samadhi, that also is seen through
the perverted material medium of the original spiritual nature. Examples65 are
seen in the place66, time67, and persons68 that are mentioned in the pastimes
of Vraja. All these examples may be understood in two ways. For the
kanistha-adhikaris these examples are only appreciated through complete faith.
There is no other possibility for their advancement. But for the
uttama-adhikaris these examples are accepted as indications of spiritual
variegated nature. When conditioned souls are free from material affinity, then
they will perceive the constitutional pastimes of the Lord.


 


3)
Conditioned souls naturally perceive the pastimes of the Lord in terms of their
affinity for Him. This affinity is of two kindsÂ—that which is found in an
individual and that which is found in a general mass of people. The affinity
found in the hearts of particular devotees is that which is found in an
individual. The hearts of Prahlada and Dhruva were sitting places for the
pastimes of the Lord as a result of their individual affinity.


 


4)
Just as a particular feature of the Lord appears in and purifies the heart of a
person according to the awakening of his knowledge, if we similarly envision
the whole society as one person and consider its childhood, youth, and old age,
then the particular feature of the Lord that manifests becomes a community
asset. As the community's knowledge matures, they first take to fruitive
activities, then the cultivation of knowledge, and ultimately they take to
spiritual activities and become purified. The affinity that is found in a general
mass of people first appeared in the hearts of Narada and Vyasa in Dvapara-yuga
and has progressively been propagated as pure Vaisnava religion.


 


5
Â– 6) This Vaisnava religion in the form of the pastimes of the Lord is divided
into three parts according to the development of a society's knowledge. The
first part is the pastimes of Dvaraka, where the Lord is opulent, where He is
known as Vibhu, and where His is worshiped through regulative principles. The
second part is seen around Mathura, where the Lord's opulence is partially
manifest with a greater portion of sweetness. But the third part, the pastimes
of Vraja, is the best of all. Pastimes that contain more sweetness are superior
and more intimate by nature. Therefore Krsna is most complete in the pastimes
of Vraja. Although opulences are part of the Lord's splendor, they cannot
become prominent before Krsna; because wherever opulences are more prominent,
sweetness is diminished. This is also the case in the material world. Therefore
objects of sweetness like cows, gopas, gopis, cowherds' dress, butter, forests,
fresh leaves, the Yamuna, and the flute are the only wealth of Vraja-Gokula, or
Vrndavana. What is the need for opulence there?


 


7)
Supreme rasas under the shelter of the four relationshipsÂ—dasya, sakhya,
vatsalya, and madhuryaÂ—are eternally existing in the pastimes of Vraja as the
ingredients of all spiritual activities. Among all these rasas, the pastimes of
the Lord with the gopis are the highest. And among these, the Lord's pastimes
with Srimati Radharani, who is the crest jewel amongst the gopis, are still
higher.


 


8)
Those who relish this topmost spiritual rasa are said to have accepted their
eternal constitutional activities.


 


9)
Fearing to cross the threshold of argument, some madhyama-adhikaris say, Â“Just
try to explain these feelings with simple words. There is no need to use
Krsna's pastimes as examples.Â” But such type of comments are faulty, for the
variegated nature of Vaikuntha cannot be explained with simple words. Just by
saying, Â“There is a Lord. Worship Him,Â” does not properly explain the living
entities' supreme constitutional duties. The act of worship is not possible
without a relationship. To be situated in Brahman after giving up maya cannot
be called worship, because in this process only an indirect mood of negation is
accepted; there is nothing positive. But by saying, Â“See the form of the Lord.
Take shelter of the Lord's lotus feet,Â” the quality of variegated nature is
somewhat accepted. At this juncture we must consider that if one is not fully
satisfied with spiritual variegated nature, one may still address the Absolute
Truth as Â“LordÂ” or Â“Father.Â” Although these relationships appear mundane, there
is nonetheless an indescribable purpose behind them. Since one must accept
material ingredients, activities, and all the perverted mundane reflections of
the relationships of Vaikuntha as examples, swanlike persons must not fear to
extract from these the understanding of spiritual activities and ingredients by
the propensity of swans. Out of fear that foreign scholars will not understand
this and accuse us as idol worshipers, should we submerge the jewel of
spiritualism? Those who will criticize are certainly immature in their
conclusions. Being on a higher platform, why should we fear their fallacious
conclusions? The science of rasa cannot be fully explained by ordinary words,
therefore poets such as Vyasadeva have elaborately described the pastimes of
Krsna. Those wonderful pastimes of the Lord are the respected wealth for both
kanistha-adhikaris and uttama-adhikaris.


 


10)
The happiness that Lord Krsna bestows when He is properly served is not
obtained when He is worshiped as Yajnesvara through karma-yoga, as impersonal
Brahman through jnana-yoga, or as Paramatma, the companion of the living
entity, through dhyana-yoga. Therefore serving Krsna is the supreme
occupational duty for all living entitiesÂ—whether kanistha-adhikari or
fortunate uttama-adhikari.


 


11)
All Vaisnavas should read this Krsna-samhita and understand the science of
Krsna. All the results that one achieves by studying Srimad Bhagavatam will be
achieved by studying this book.
