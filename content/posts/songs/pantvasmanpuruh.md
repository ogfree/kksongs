TRANSLATION

1) O Sri 
Narasimha
, who is omnipresent, may 
Your
 nails protect me and others at all times. Just as a
lion attacks powerful elephant groups and splits apart their heads with its
nails and the 
vajrayudha
 (
Indra's

defense weapon) splits the highest mountains, in the similar way, the 
Asuras
 (who through the blessings of Lord 
Brahmadeva
, Lord Siva and the demigods) are like powerful
exhilarating elephants who are easily killed by each of Lord 
Nrsimhadeva's
 nails which are precious and powerful.



2) All demigods are devoted to and praying to this nail, which eliminates all
bad elements in this world. They are very devoted to this nail as it will give
all six senses of a 
brahman

or 
devatas
. This nail will even give complete
knowledge and the gods will come out of the darkness (of ignorance). By praying
to this nail, they will get peace and knowledge of all the qualities of Lord
Sri 
Hari
.



3) O Lord 
Nrsimhadeva
, who has Sri 
Lakshmidevi
 by His side, there is no body equal to you. If
there is any thing which is equal, it is '
astama
 
rasa
' the famous six essences. Similarly, there is nobody
equal or 
uttama
 [more excellent] than you.


 


4)
There are many Brahma's, many 
Rudra's
, many 
Indra's
 and all of these and other demigods became ashes
because of your smallest vision. Your vision is like the smallest firefly [a
twinkling insect which glows in night], yet it has the brightness of the sun's
rays.
