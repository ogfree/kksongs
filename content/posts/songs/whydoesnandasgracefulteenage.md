LYRICS:


(1)


Why
does Nanda's graceful teenage son,


Whose
charming clever joking always sends


The
gopas into fits of laughter shun


The
surabhi cows and all His cheerful friends?


 


(2)


Why
does His flower-twined flute lay on the ground


Untouched
and why does He not speak a word?


Why
does He not make a single sound,


And
why does He leave His lunch of fruit and curd?


 


(3)


Why
does the fragrant forest grove not fill


Him
with glorious feelings of delight?


Why
does He sit alone on Govardhana Hill,


His
form shaded from the sun's bright light?


 


(4)


Why is
He motionless and pale and why


So
sadly does He sigh and sigh and sigh?
