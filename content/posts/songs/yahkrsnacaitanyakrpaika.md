TRANSLATION


1)
Falling on the ground, we repeatedly bow down and take shelter of Prabhu Lokanatha
Gosvami. His only wealth is the mercy of Lord Krsna Caitanya, and his heart is
decorated with the golden ornaments of pure love.


 


2)
We take shelter of Lokanatha Prabhu, who always stayed in Vrndavana,
remembering Krsna's pastimes and always engaged in devotional service.


 


3)
We take shelter of Lokanatha Prabhu, who was radiant with love. He was always
busy in devotional service: hearing about Sri Sri Radha and Krsna and serving
Them in many ways.


 


4)
We take shelter of Lokanatha Prabhu. Who is now not plunged in the sweetness of
service to the lotus feet of Vrndavana's king and queen? Among these devotees
charming Lokanatha Prabhu is the best.


 


5)
We take shelter of Lokanatha Prabhu. He became filled with grief when he saw
the people were not eager to taste the sweetness of Krsna's pastimes. His only
desire was to taste that sweetness.


 


6)
We take shelter of Lokanatha Prabhu, who completely renounced material sense
gratification. A wise devotee named Narottama dasa Thakura understood the
greatness of his mercy.


 


7)
We take shelter of Lokanatha Prabhu, who is not unfriendly to the sinful. By
his mercy the foolish materialists have entered the path of spontaneous
devotional service.


 


8)
We take shelter of Lokanatha Prabhu. Desiring to become like him and attain
what he attained, we have become the servant of the servant of the follower of
the servant of his servant.


 


9)
These eight noble verses glorifying Lokanatha Gosvami reveal the highest goal of
life. One who reads them with devotion will immediately attain the path of pure
devotional service. He will serve Srimati Radharani.


 


10)
With splendid glances illuminating the path of pure love and with the splendid
effulgence of his mercy chasing the deep darkness from the well of my heart,
may Lokanatha Gosvami appear before me. Taking shelter of Him, we have found
Govardhana Hill filled with the jewels of Krsna's transcendental pastimes.
