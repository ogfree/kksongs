TRANSLATION


1)
I worship the greatly learned and exalted spiritual master, 
Srila


Gadadhara
 
Prabhu
, who
appears very splendid, engaged in the Lord's devotional service. He always
performs pastimes in 
Vraja
, where he is very
prominent among the 
gopis
, who are very dear to Lord 
Hari
. Lord 
Caitanya
, the Son of 
Saci
 is the dear Lord of 
Gadadhara


Prabhu
, who is preaching the service of 
Radha
 and Krsna.


 


2)
I worship the greatly learned spiritual master, 
Srila


Gadadhara
 
Prabhu
. He is
expertly absorbed in meditation on the nine 
rasas
 of
devotional service, beginning with 
ujjvala-rasa

(conjugal love), and he dances in the waves of the amazing ocean of devotional
service to Lord 
Caitanya
. He preaches the path of 
raganuga-bhakti
 (spontaneous devotional service), and He is
a fit person to attain residence in the transcendental 
land
 of 
Vraja
.




Â 
3) I worship the greatly learned
spiritual master, 
Srila
 
Gadadhara


Prabhu
. The best of those who are devoted to the
lotus feet of Lord 
Caitanya
, the Son of 
Saci-devi
, offer respectful 
obeisances

to him and treat him with great importance, and he is very dear to Lord Krsna,
Who is seated in the middle of the lotus flower which is his heart, assuming
His golden form of 
Caitanya
 
Mahaprabhu
.
He preaches that Lord 
Mukunda
 has assumed the golden
form of Lord 
Caitanya
, and he returns the living
entities to their constitutional position as servants of the Lord.


 


4)
I worship the greatly learned and exalted spiritual master, 
Srila


Gadadhara
 
Prabhu
. It is
only because of him that the truth of the exalted devotional service performed
by the intimate associates of Krsna in the forests and groves of 
Vrndavana
 has been revealed. He is preaching the ecstatic
love attained by the 
gopis
, and he is indeed a
personification of 
the mellows
 of devotional service.
The saintly devotees take shelter of his lotus feet, and he teaches the truth
of spiritual life to the living entities.


 


5)
I worship the greatly learned spiritual master, 
Srila


Gadadhara
 
Prabhu
. He is
very dear to Lord 
Caitanya
 
Mahaprabhu
,
and it is as if he had sprouted from the manifestation of the LordÂ’s ecstatic
love. He is always adorned with the garments of ecstatic love of Godhead, and
He delights Lord 
Caitanya
 
Mahaprabhu

by arousing in the Lord the ecstatic emotional love experienced by the 
gopis
 of 
Vraja
.


 


6)
I worship the greatly learned spiritual master, 
Srila


Gadadhara
 
Prabhu
, who
expands 
the mellows
 of devotional service and whose
lotus feet are worshipped by the kings of the 
brahmanas
.
Among his confidential associates, he reveals his actual form as 
Srimati
 
Radharani
. He distributes
the nectar of the ecstatic mellow of the 
gopis

conjugal love, strictly following the instructions of all the devotional
scriptures.


 


7)
I worship the greatly learned spiritual master, 
Srila


Gadadhara
 
Prabhu
. With
delight he is giving the devotional service of Lord 
Caitanya

which reveals the 
nectarean
 ocean
 of the most exalted mellows of devotional service,
along with the nectar flowing from the lotus feet of the 
gopis
,
headed by 
Srimati
 
Radharani
,
who is most dear to Krsna. 
Gadadhara
 
Prabhu
 is decorated with the eight transcendental ecstatic
symptoms of 
sattvika-bhava
, and he is distributing
devotional service to his 
worshipable
 Lord Krsna.


 


8)
I worship the greatly learned spiritual master, 
Srila


Gadadhara
 
Prabhu
. Even a
conditioned soul, whose mind becomes anointed by the colorful waves of
spontaneous devotional service as delineated by 
Srila


Gadadhara
 
Prabhu
, quickly
attains the highest level of devotional service. He becomes like a maddened
bumble bee whose mind is anointed with the mellow of 
ujjvala-rasa

(conjugal love).


 


9)
These eight verses glorifying 
Srila
 
Gadadhara
 
Prabhu
 distribute the
nectar of the most exalted mellow of devotional service, and they are like a
festival for the 
gopis
 of 
Vraja
.
If one regularly reads these verses and serves the lotus feet of 
Srila
 
Gadadhara
 
Prabhu
, who is an incarnation of 
Srimati


Radharani
, then he will become qualified to attain
the jewel of pure devotional service for the lotus feet of Lord 
Caitanya
, the son of 
Sacidevi
.
