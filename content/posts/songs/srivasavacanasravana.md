TRANSLATION


1)
Hearing these words of 
Srivasa
 
Pandita
,
all those chaste and faithful ladies gave up their lamentation for the dead
son, because 
Srivasa
 had satisfied their minds by
informing them of the transcendental mellows of Lord 
Hari
.


 


2)
Then 
Srivasa
 again came out into the courtyard and,
overwhelmed with joy, resumed dancing with Lord 
Caitanya

and loudly sang the glories of the Son of 
Nanda

Maharaja, completely forgetting about what had just happened.


 


3)
The boy had expired only 1 Â– Â½ hours after dark, but out in the courtyard no
one had known anything due to the loud 
kirtana
. Then
for 9 hours there was continuous chanting of the auspicious holy names. Thus
the entire night had elapsed in this ecstatic singing.


 


4)
Then the 
kirtana
 stopped, and Lord 
Gaurahari
 said, "Why am I feeling some unhappiness
today? I can understand that something inauspicious has happened in this house
which has robbed 
Me
 of My bliss."


 


5)
Then the devotees related to the Lord the story of the death of 
Srivasa's
 son. Hearing this news, the Lord loudly
exclaimed, "Oh no! What has happened? Now the core of 
My

heart has become pierced with so much unbearable pain!"


 


6)
"Why didn't you inform 
Me
 of this calamity when
it had just happened?" Now, 
Bhaktivinoda
 has
completely lost himself in the affection that he Lords shows to His own
devotees.
