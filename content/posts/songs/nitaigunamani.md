TRANSLATION


1) My Lord
Nityananda, the jewel of all virtues, my Lord Nityananda, the jewel of all
virtues, has brought the flood of ecstatic love of God that has drowned the
entire world.


 



2)
Bringing this overwhelming deluge of prema when He returned to Bengal from
Jagannatha Puri on Lord Caitanya's order, Nitai has inundated the assembly of
devotees. The fallen nondevotees did not drown, however, but remained floating
on that ecstatic ocean.


 


3)
Lord Nityananda freely offered this exalted prema, which is difficult for Lord
Brahma to attain, even to the fallen and wretched souls who did not desire it.


 


4) The
ocean of mercy had formerly been sealed tight, but Nitai cut a channel in its
boundary to allow the great flooding waves of nectarean prema to splash from
house to house.


 


5)
Locana dasa says, "Whoever has not worshiped my Nitai or taken advantage
of this excellent opportunity offered by Him knowingly commits suicide."
