LYRICS:


(1)


Of
sweet things, it's the sweetest you will taste at any time;


Of
things that bring good fortune, it's good fortune's paradigm;


Of
things that purify, it purifies most powerf'lly;


The
Holy Name of Sri Hari is surely all that be.


 


(2)


From
Brahma's realm atop the sky down to the lowly grass,


Illusion
reigns in Maya-devi's treacherous morass.


The
truth, the truth, the only truth: the Name of Sri Hari.


The
Holy Name of Sri Hari is surely all that be.


 


(3)


He's
the guru, he's the father, he's the friend most true,


And
she's the real mother who most kindly teaches you


To
always chant and hear the Holy Name of Sri Hari.


The
Holy Name of Sri Hari is surely all that be.


 


(4)


Remember
that our final breath may come at any time,


No
matter if we're old and sick or in our youthful prime.


So
young and old alike should chant the Name incessantly.


The
Holy Name of Sri Hari is surely all that be.


 


(5)


Lord
Sri Hari forever dwells wherever devotees


Whose
hearts are fixed on Him and free of all impurities


Uplift
their voices high and sing His Name in ecstasy.


The
Holy Name of Sri Hari is surely all that be.


 


(6)


Alas!
What sorrow! What great pain! The worst calamity-


For
people to forget the Holy Name of Sri Hari!


Although
the Name's a priceless gem, mere broken glass they see.


The
Holy Name of Sri Hari is surely all that be.


 


(7)


Just
fill your ears, just fill them with the Name of Sri Hari!


Just
chant the Name, just chant the Name with all sincerity!


Just
sing the Name, just sing the Holy Name eternally!


The
Holy Name of Sri Hari is surely all that be.


 


(8)


It
makes this world appear like bits of straw upon the ground;


It
splendorously reigns supreme-divinity in sound;


It's
filled with transcendental bliss and peerless purity;


The
Holy Name of Sri Hari is surely all that be.


 


(9)


Inspired
to glorify the Holy Name of Sri Hari,


A
certain sage composed this hymn in Sanskrit poetry.


I pray
that those who read this lowly version made by me


Will
chant the Holy Name of Sri Hari in ecstasy.
