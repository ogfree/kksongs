TRANSLATION


(Refrain) O 
Krsna
, what more can I say to You? You are the most wise.
You are the graceful dark dancer. With these melodies You call the fair 
gopis
.


 


1) How many melodies do You
play on the flute placed to Your flower-petal lips? Leaving their homes, the
saintly 
gopis
 run to You. They have no power to stay
away.


 


2) Putting down the flute,
now You speak sweetly. No one is like You. Meeting the 
gopis

closely, You declare that You are in debt to them.


 


3) Thus You speak to the
saintly 
gopis
. In this secluded place You will
embrace them to Your heart. The saintly devotees are not shy to praise these
pastimes. So speaks 
Govinda
 
dasa
.


 


REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:


This
song is in Raga
