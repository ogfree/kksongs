TRANSLATION


1) Having fallen into this
vast ocean of material existence, my heart has become extremely worried. I
cannot even find a clue of the means to get some help.


 


2) I have no strength from 
fruitive
 activities or speculative knowledge. Nor do I have
any help from virtues created by sacrifices, yoga practice or austerities.


 


3) I am extremely feeble,
and I don't know how to swim. Who will rescue me from this dreadful calamity?


 


4) I see the horrible
alligator of sense gratification present before me, the waves of lust are
constantly agitating and provoking me.


 


5) I can no longer cope
with all the urges that are pushing me like a raging wind from my previous
births. I simply weep with an agitated mind, for I do not see any rescuer in
sight.


 


6) Oh most revered 
Jahnava
 
Devi
! Please show mercy to
this servant today by virtue of your own good qualities, and kindly relieve all
of his afflictions.


 


7) By taking the shelter of
the boat of 
Your
 lotus feet I will certainly be able
to cross over this vast ocean of material existence.


 


8) You are the very
pleasure potency of Lord 
Nityananda
, and you are the
spiritual master of devotion to Lord Krsna. Kindly bestow upon this servant the
wish-fulfilling desire tree of your lotus feet.


 


9) Thus this most wretched
and shameful rogue begs at your feet today, for he sees that you are delivering
many other sinners.
