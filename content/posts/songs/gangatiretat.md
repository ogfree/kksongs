TRANSLATION




1)
Let me surrender to 
Srila
 
Advaita


Acarya
, who with 
tulasi

leaves flowers water from the GangesÂ§ shore and loud calls of love worshiped
Lord 
Gaura
 and begged Him to appear. 


 


2)
Let me surrender to 
Srila
 
Advaita


Acarya
. Attracted by His loud calls, the golden Lord
of 
Goloka
 
Vrndavana
 who is
an ocean of ecstatic love appeared in Sri 
Navadvipa
. 


 


3)
Let me surrender to 
Srila
 
Advaita


Acarya
 who by making the moon of Lord 
Caitanya
 rise flooded the world with a love even Brahma and
the great demigods cannot attain. 


 


4)
Let me surrender to 
Srila
 
Advaita


Acarya
 whose mercy is beyond understanding and by
whose request alone all-powerful Lord 
Caitanya

disappeared from this world. 


 


5)
Let me surrender to 
Srila
 
Advaita


Acarya
 who is not different from the form of Lord 
Maha-Visnu
 and whose parts and parcels are the Brahma 
Visnu
 and Siva engaged in the creation maintenance, and
destruction of the worlds. 


 


6)
Let me surrender to 
Srila
 
Advaita


Acarya
 who is worshiped by all who is attained only
by devotional service and who as is heard in a certain Vedic literature because
He is Lord Siva's shelter has a name and glory like Lord Siva's. 


 


7)
Let me surrender to 
Srila
 
Advaita


Acarya
 who is flooded with love for Lord 
Caitanya
 and whose beloved 
Sita-devi

and son 
Acyutananda
 are also filled with love.


 


8)
Let me surrender to 
Srila
 
Advaita


Acarya
 whose heart is Lord 
Gaura's

eternal home who is named 
Advaita
 because He is not
(a) different (
dvaita
) from Lord 
Nityananda

and who is named 
Acarya
 because He teaches devotional
service. 


 


9)
A person whose intelligence is pure and who every morning happily reads these
eight verses glorifying Lord 
Advaita
 the husband of 
Sita
 attains devotion for His lotus feet and becomes dear
to Him.
