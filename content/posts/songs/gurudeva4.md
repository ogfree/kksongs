LYRICS:


(1)


gurudev!

kṛpā-bindu diyā, koro' ei dāse,

tṛṇāpekhā ati hīna

sakala sahane, bala diyā koro',

nija-māne spṛhā-hīna

sakale
sammāna korite śakati,

deho' nātha! jathājatha

tabe to' gāibo, hari-nāma-sukhe,

aparādha ha 'be hata


 


(3)


kabe
heno kṛpā, labhiyā e jana,

kṛtārtha hoibe, nātha!

śakti-buddhi-hīna, āmi ati dīna,

koro' more ātma-sātha

jogyatā-vicāre,
kichu nāhi pāi,

tomāra karuṇā-sāra

karuṇā nā hoile, kāndiyā kāndiyā,

prāṇa nā rākhibo āra


 


WORD
FOR WORD TRANSLATION: 
Gurudeva!
Krpa Bindu Diya


 


TRANSLATION



1)
Gurudeva, O spiritual master! Give to this servant just one drop of mercy. I am
lower than a blade of grass. Give me all help. Give me strength. Let me be as
you are, without desires or aspirations. 


 


2) I
offer you all respects, for thus I may have the energy to know you correctly.
Then, by chanting the holy name in great ecstasy, all my offenses will cease. 


 


3)
When will such mercy fall to this one who is weak and devoid of intelligence?
Allow me to be with you. 


 


4) If
you examine me, you will find no qualities. Your mercy is all that I am made
of. If you are not merciful unto me, I can only weep, and I will not be able to
maintain my life.
