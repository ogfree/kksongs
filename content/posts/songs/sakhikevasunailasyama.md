TRANSLATION


1) O my dear 
sakhi
, who is that person who first made 
Me

hear this name Â“
Syama
Â”? When it enters 
My
 heart through My ears, I become overwhelmed with
impatience.


 


2) I donÂ’t know how much
sweetness fills this name. It is so sweet that 
My

tongue will not leave it for a moment. As I go on repeating this name, I become
completely absorbed. O 
sakhi
, how will I ever be able
to meet Him?


 


3) If that personÂ’s name
alone has the power to put 
Me
 in such a condition, I
cannot even imagine what My condition would be if I were to touch His body. Wherever
He stays, how can the young women maintain their religious principles?


 


4) In My heart I want to
forget Him, but I cannot. Now I cannot understand what is the remedy, what to
do. 
Dvija
 
Candidasa
 says,
Â“Simply by displaying His youthful beauty, that 
Syamananda

has destroyed the whole dynasty of young cultured ladies.Â”


 


REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:


The
first word of the song can be changed to Â“
sai
.Â”
