TRANSLATION


1) I
offer my respectful obeisances to that foremost of thieves Â– who is famous in
Vraja as the butter-thief and He who steals the gopisÂ’ clothes, and who, for
those who take shelter of Him, steals the sins which have accrued over many
lifetimes.


 


2) I
offer my respectful obeisances to the foremost of thieves Â– who steals Srimati
RadhikaÂ’s heart, who steals the dark luster of a fresh raincloud, and who steals
all the sins and sufferings of those who take shelter of His feet.


 


3) He
turns His surrendered devotees into paupers and wandering, homeless beggar Â–
alas! Such a fearsome thief has never been seen or heard of in all the three
worlds.


 


4)
Mere utterance of His name purges one of a mountain of sins Â– such an
astonishingly wonderful thief I have never seen or heard of anywhere!


 


5) O
Thief! Having stolen my wealth, my honor, my senses, my life and my everything,
where can You run to? I have caught You with the rope of my devotion.


 


6) You
cut the terrible noose of Yamaraja, You sever the dreadful noose of material
existence, and You slash everyoneÂ’s material bondage, but You are unable to cut
the knot fastened by Your own loving devotees.


 


7) O
stealer of my everything! O Thief! Today I have imprisoned You in the miserable
prison-house of my heart which is very fearful due to the terrible darkness of
my ignorance, and there for a very long time You will remain, receiving
appropriate punishment for Your crimes of thievery!


 


8) O
Krsna, thief of my everything! The noose of my devotion remaining forever
tight, You will continue to reside in the prison-house of my heart because I
will not release You for millions of aeons.
