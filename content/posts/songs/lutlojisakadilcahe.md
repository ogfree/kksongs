LYRICS:


(introductory
stanza)


re manavā; lūṭ
tu le kṛṣṇa nāma pyār se


 


(refrain)


lūṭ lo jisakā
dil cāhe maiń śor macāūń galī galī


kṛṣṇa nāma
ke; hari nāma ke; rāma nāma ke 


hīre motī maiń
bikharāūń galī galī


 


(1)


daulat ke dīvāne
sun lo! ek din aise āyegā


dhana yauvana aur rūpa
khazānā; yahīń dharā reh jāyegā


(terī) sundara kāyā
miṭṭī hogī; caracā hogī galī galī


 


(2)


mitra pyāre sage
sambandhī; ek din tujhe bhūla jāyeńge


kal tak apanā jo kahate
the; agni pe tujhe sulāeńge


jagata sadā do din kā
hai; āḳhir hogī calī calī


 


(3)


jinako apanā kahakar bande;
tu itnā itarātā hai


choḍ deńge sabhī
vipat meń; koī sāth nahīń jātā hai


do din kā yeh caman khilā
hai; phir murjhāe kalī kalī


 


(4)


kyūń karatā
hai Â‘merī merīÂ’? taj de is abhimān ko


jhūṭe dhandhe
choḍ ke bande; japa le kṛṣṇa ke nāma ko


yeh samaya aur phir nā
milegā; pacatāe mana kal hī kal hī


 


(5)


jis-jis ne yeh motī lūte;
(re manavā lūṭ tu le) voh to mālāmāl hue


duniyā ke jo bane pūjārī;
āḳhir voh kańgāl hue


sone cāndī motī
valoń; maiń samjhāūń galī galī


 


TRANSLATION:


Introductory
verse: Oh my mind! Please lovingly take KrsnaÂ’s name!


 


Refrain:
I shall shout to every town and village, Â“WhoeverÂ’s heart wants this, take the
diamond and pearls of KrsnaÂ’s name, HariÂ’s name, and RamaÂ’s name that IÂ’m
scattering about at every town and village!Â”


 


1)
To the crazy persons obsessed with wealth, listen! Such a day will arise, where
your wealth, youth, treasure, and form will remain back on earth, when you go.
Your beautiful body will become dirt and chattering about this will happen in
every town and village!


 


2)
Friends, beloved people, close family and relatives will one day forget about
you. Everyone that you have considered your own will have you sleep on a
funeral pyre (upon death). Life on earth is very short. Then after that, you
will be gone from this planet!


 


3)
O mankind, everyone you call your own that you proudly boast about will leave
you at the time of adversity. No one shall accompany you. The flowers in the
garden blossom for a short time. Then, all of those flowers will wither away!


 


4)
Why do you say Â“mine! mine?Â” Give up this false pride! Give up your false
business, Oh mankind, and chant KrsnaÂ’s holy name! You will not receive this
time once again. Your mind will repent tomorrow!


 


5)
Whoever takes this pearl from me (Oh my mind! Please take these!), they will
become rich beyond measure! Those who became worshippers of materialism of the
world will ultimately become paupers! To those who are still obsessed with
gold, silver, and pearls, I will try to explain it to you in each town and
village.


 


REMARKS/EXTRA
INFORMATION:


This
bhajan was popularized by Vamsidhari Surya prabhu in his live concert album Â“Krsna
Jinaka Nama HaiÂ”, as well as Sacidevi mataji in her album Â“Nama Hari Ka Jap Le
Bande.Â” Both renditions were in Raga Misra Bhairavi in Kaherva Tala.
