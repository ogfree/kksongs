TRANSLATION


1)
Covering your face with a great black cloak, you hid your moonlike face from
your elders' prying eyes.


 


2)
In the impenetrable darkness and mist of night, 
Kamadeva's

lamp showed you the path.


 


3)
O girl with beautiful hips, you hurried to your meeting with 
Krsna
. Overcome with ecstatic love, you walked slowly.


 


4)
Filled with the desire to taste nectar of the Lord, you took two steps and then
four. O beautiful girl, you dropped your toy lotus flower.


 


5)
You dropped the jasmine crown from your head. You broke the string of jewels at
your neck.


 


6)
You were overcome with new love. Your very full style rebuked all rivals.


 


7)
Your garments and ornaments were hidden under a great black cloak. In this way
you met Lord 
Krsna
 in the forest. Thus speaks 
Govinda
 
dasa
.
