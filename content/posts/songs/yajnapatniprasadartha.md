TRANSLATION


1) O
Lord Krsna, all glories unto You. In order to show mercy to the wives of
certain brahmanas engaged in performing sacrifices, You greatly increased the
hunger of the cowherd boys. Hearing the intent complaints of the cowherd boys
who were greatly afflicted by hunger, You advised that they beg foodstuffs from
the brahmanas who were about to offer a sacrifice.


 


2) O
Lord Krsna, although the unintelligent brahmanas disrespected and ignored You,
their wives, who were Your devotees, became attracted by hearing about You, and
desired to see You. O Lord, Their minds and hearts became enchanted by You.


 


3) O
Lord Krsna, Your amazing and colorful appearance, garments and ornaments
removed all the distress of the brahmana's wives. You glorified them and they
expressed their desire to engage in Your devotional service. O Lord, all
glories unto You.


 


4) O
Lord Krsna, You were pleased by the plaintive appeals of the brahmana's wives,
and You granted to them devotional service in pure love of God. You immediately
removed any obstacles that their husbands might offer (upon their return). O
Lord, I offer respectful obeisances unto You.


 


5) O
Lord Krsna, although You became greatly pleased (by eating) the foodstuff
offered by the wives of the brahmanas engaged in performing sacrifices, You
caused great distress to the brahmanas who were their husbands. O Lord, because
You are the worshippable deity of the brahmanas, You granted transcendental
knowledge to these brahmanas, when they had all assembled together.
