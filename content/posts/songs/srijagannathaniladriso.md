TRANSLATION


1) O Lord 
Jagannatha
,
O Lord of the universe, O crest jewel of the city of 
Jagannatha


Puri
, O Supreme Person whose form is spiritual
although it appears to be made of wood, and whose complexion is like that of a
dark rain-cloud, O Lord, please be merciful to me.


 


2) O Lord 
Jagannatha
,
Your lotus eyes have blossomed wide-open and 
You

appear to be nectar washed up on the shore of the salt-water ocean. O 
monarch
 who enjoys multifarious royal pleasures and whose
waist is decorated with pearls, O Lord, please protect me.


 


3) O Lord 
Jagannatha
,
You were pleased by the worship of King 
Indradyumna

and 
You
 grant to the devotees the 
prasada

(foodstuffs offered to You) which appears to be nectar coming from Your own
lips. O younger brother of Lord 
Balarama
, who
earnestly takes care of 
Your
 sister 
Subhadra-devi
, I offer respectful 
obeisances

unto You.


 


4) O Lord 
Jagannatha
,
with the 
rathayatra
 journey to 
Gundica

and other festivals, 
You
 increase the happiness of the
devotees. O decoration of the 
rathayatra
 chariot, O
Lord who is very kind and affectionate to 
Your

devotees, I offer respectful 
obeisances
 unto You.


 


5) O Lord 
Jagannatha
,
Your mind is moistened with kindness to the poor, miserable, abandoned and
destitute greatly fallen souls. O Lord, the sight of whom and the glorification
of whose qualities is ever-fresh, O Lord who is very dear to Lord 
Caitanya
 
Mahaprabhu
, (I offer
respectful 
obeisances
 unto 
You
).
