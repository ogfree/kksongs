TRANSLATION


1)
O Lord 
Krsna
, I offer respectful 
obeisances

unto 
You
. When 
Kamsa

attempted to violently kill 
Durga-devi
, she told him
that 
You
 had already been born. 
Kamsa

became amazed, and he released 
Your
 father, mother and
relatives (from the prison).


 


2)
O 
Krsna
, 
Kamsa
, his mind
purified by constantly remembering 
You
 with fear,
became enlightened, and he spoke transcendental knowledge to Your mother and
father and thus pacified them.


 


3)
O 
Lord
Â  
Krsna
, trapped in the verbal network of bad
Â  
advice 
Â 
form
Â 

his demonic
Â  
ministers, 
Kamsa
 agreed to a very wicked plan. 
Kamsa

transgressed the desires of the saintly devotees, and in this way it appeared
that his life was soon to end.


 


REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:


This
is based on 
Srimad
 
Bhagavatam

Canto 10 Chapter 4.
