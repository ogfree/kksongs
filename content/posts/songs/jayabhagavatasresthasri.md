TRANSLATION


1)
O Lord 
Krsna
, all glories unto 
You
.
The greatest devotee, 
Narada
 
Muni
,
offered prayers to 
You
, saying that Your eternal
transcendental form is unlimited, and that You are the controller of the
demigods who control the conditioned souls.


 


2)
O Lord 
Krsna
, 
Narada
 
Muni
 explained that although 
You

are the creator of the three modes of material nature which cause Your illusory
energy to manifest the creation, maintenance and destruction of this material
world, You are also the Supreme truth after Whom the saintly devotees aspire.
The sage 
Narada
 then recounted how 
You

manifested in this world upon the request of the pious demigods, and he
predicted how You would kill King 
Kamsa
 and perform
any other pastimes in the future.


 


3)
O Lord 
Krsna
, 
Narada
 
Muni
 completely described how 
You

would expertly perform pastimes. Jubilant because he has attained the great
festival of seeing 
You
, the sage offered his
respectful 
obeisances
.
