TRANSLATION


1) 
Nanda-dulala
,
the beloved son of 
Nanda
, comes back from the cow
pasture. His blackish form sprinkled with the dust kicked up by the cows'
hooves, (He wears) a garland of forest flowers which reaches to His knees.


 


2-4) Hearing the sound of
the cowherd boys' horns and flutes, the 
Brajavasis

come running. Standing in the doorways of their houses, 
All

the ladies wave plates of lamps to greet 
Krishna
, who wears yellow garments. His face vanquishes the beauty of the full
moon. He wears a fresh 
Manjari
 blossom on His ear, a
peacock feather in the crown of His topknot, and plays upon His enchanting
flute. All the 
Brajabasis
, young and old, behold Him
with unblinking eyes, like thirsty partridges upon finding the moon*; they
can't bear to return to their houses. 


Â 


5) All the cows enter their
respective sheds, and 
Nanda-lala
 walks home. Utterly
delighted, 
Yashomati
 comes out to meet Him on the
path. 
Relishable
 is this song of 
Mohana
.
