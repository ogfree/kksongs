TRANSLATION


1)
Srimati Radharani is the crest jewel of all amorous young maidens who take
pleasure in relishing transcendental mellows. She is a beautiful swan in the
waters of love for Krsna, a transcendental wish-fulfilling creeper on the
family tree of king Vrsabhanu, and the original source of all the goddesses of
fortune.


 


2)
Upon Her hips She wears red silken cloth on which tiny bells are swinging, and
upon Her breasts sways a lovely necklace of pearls. In this way She looks so
splendorous that She steals the heart of the beholder.


 


3)
Her bodily luster is exceptionally effulgent, like the golden whorl of the best
of lotus flowers. Her two sweetly smiling lips display the immortal nectar of
adolescence mixed with the fragrant camphor of new youthfulness. She is
completely faithful to Lord Krsna.


 


4)
Seeing that the supremely mischievous son of Nanda has arrived on the outskirts
of the Vrndavana forest as He returns from tending the cows, She becomes
stricken with anxiety and affectionately offers prayers to Him by the hints and
signals of Her eyes.


 


5)
Srimati Radharani is the life and soul of all the elder women of Vraja, and is
especially dear to Mother Yasoda. Basking in the affection of charming
Lalita-devi, Radha's bodily form has fully blossomed like a lotus, thus
displaying Her beautiful and graceful limbs.


 


6)
Accompanied by Visakha, Radha picks forest flowers and strings together a
vaijayanti flower garland for Krsna. She is the well-wisher of all, and is
always situated upon the chest of the Lord, being the most beloved young
girlfriend of Krsna.


 


7)
Hearing the soft sound of the flute, She moves swiftly through the forest, and
finding in the bowers of Vraja the best of dancing actors, the chaste Radha
with smiling eyes turns her face downward in shyness while restlessly
scratching Her ear.


 


8)
When the breeze, which is scented with the fragrance of lotus flowers, makes
the waters of Radha-kunda very cool, then, in the warmth of the summer in those
cooling waters, Radha along with all Her girlfriends satisfies the hero of
Gokula.


 


9)
Bhaktivinoda says to Rupa and Raghunatha, clasping their lotus feet, "When
will you bestow your mercy upon me and give me eternal service to such a Radha
as this, for Her service is the wealth of the truly wise."
