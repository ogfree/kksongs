TRANSLATION


1)
Following the sequence found in Srimad Bhagavatam, I shall now describe the
Supreme Lord Krsna. I shall do this in order to attain the perfection of
transcendental bliss, by offering 108 obeisances to Krsna.


 


2)
O Krsna, o Supreme spiritual entity, O Truth which underlies the universe, O
ingredient of which the universe is composed, O You who are in one sense not
different from everything, O You who are eternal, full of knowledge and bliss,
O You Who appear according to your own sweet will, O You Who give shelter to
all (who approach You), all glories unto You.


 


3)
O Krsna, The Supreme Brahman, You contain the universe and You are the ultimate
essence of the universe. You are without duality, full of truth, light, and
bliss. You are self-effulgent and provide shelter for all of existence.


 


3)
O unchanging and unlimited Krsna! You are always transcendentally pure and free
from material mode. You are the effulgence and infallible Supreme Personality
of Godhead. All glories unto You!
