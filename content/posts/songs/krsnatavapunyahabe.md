LYRICS:


(refrain)


kṛṣṇa
taba puṇya habe bhāi

e-puṇya koribe jabe rādhārāṇī sukhī habe

dhruva ati boli tomā tāi


 


(1)


śrī-siddhānta
saraswatī śacī-suta priya ati

kṛṣṇa-sebāya jāra tula nāi

sei se mohānta-guru jagater madhye uru

kṛṣṇa-bhakti deya ṭhāi ṭhāi


 


(2)


tāra icchā
balavān pāścātyete ṭhān ṭhān

hoy jāte gaurāńger nām

pṛthivīte nagarādi āsamudra nada nadī

sakalei bole kṛṣṇa rāma


 


(3)


tāhale ānanda
hoy tabe hoy digvijay

caitanyer kṛpā atiśay

māyā duṣṭa jata duḥkhī jagate sabāi

koribāre ājÃ±ā jadi dilo more

jogya nahi ati dīna hīna

tāi se tomāra kṛpā māgitechi anurūpā

āji tumi sabār pravīṇa

taba sańga bhāgyate miloy

suvidhā hala tomāra smaraṇa bhela

boro āśā ḍākilām tāi

āmi tomāra nitya-dāsa tāi kori eto āśa

tumi binā anya gati nāi




TRANSLATION

Refrain: O, brothers, (o brother) The Supreme Lord Krsna will bestow virtue
upon you -- but He will do this only when Srimati Radharani first becomes
pleased with you. This I surely declare to you.



1) Sri Srimad Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura, who is very dear to Lord
Gauranga, the son of mother Saci, is unparalleled in his service to the Supreme
Lord Sri Krsna. He is that great saintly spiritual master, most magnanimous
within this universe, who bestows devotion to Krsna in various places
throughout the world.



2) His desire is very powerful, and thus he is causing the Holy Name of Lord
Gauranga to spread throughout all the countries of the Western World. In all
the cities, towns, and villages on the earth, extending to all the oceans,
rivers, and streams, everyone may chant the names of Krsna and Rama.



3) Thus all directions will be conquered by a flood of transcendental ecstasy
flowing with the excessive mercy of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. When all the
miserable living entities that have been corrupted by maya become happy, then
the Vaisnava's desire is fulfilled.



4) Although my Guru Maharaja ordered me to accomplish this mission, I am
unworthy to do it, being very fallen and incompetent. That being the case, O
Lord Krsna, Your mercy is today arising in a befitting manner to make me become
worthy, for You are the wisest of all.



5) If You bestow Your divine power, then one attains the factual substance
which is service to the spiritual master - and life becomes successful. If that
service is obtained, then one becomes truly satisfied, and ultimately received
Your association due to good fortune.



6) (As stated by Prahlada Maharaja to Lord Nrsimhadeva in the Srimad
Bhagavatam, 7.9.28:)

"Thus, by associating with material desires one after another, I was
following the general populace by falling into a blind well full of snakes. My
dear Lord, O Supreme Personality of Godhead! Then the great sage Narada Muni
kindly accepted me as his disciple, and instructed me how to achieve the
transcendental position similar to his own. How could I ever leave the service
of your servant?"



7) O Lord Krsna, You are my eternal companion. Forgetting You, I have suffered
the kicking of maya birth after birth. If today the chance to meet You occurs
again, then surely I will be able to rejoin You.



8) O my dear brother! In Your company I will experience great joy once again.
Wandering about the pastures and fields, I will pass the entire day with You in
tending the cows. Joking with You and frolicking throughout so many forests of
Vraja, I will enjoy pastimes of stealing and eating one anotherÂ’s lunch. When,
oh when will that day be mine?



9) Today that remembrance of being with You came to me in a very nice way.
Feeling great longing I called out for You, O Lord Krsna! Only because I am
Your eternal servant do I desire Your association so much. Except for You, I
have no other refuge.
