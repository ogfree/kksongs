TRANSLATION


1)
When will I be able to leave this plane of my gross bodily identity far behind?
Within a split second, I will completely forget about all these false external
affairs and behold the exquisite beauty of the transcendental realm of Vraja,
which is completely paraded with eternal, conscious bliss.


 


2)
I shall then take birth in Barsana, the town of King Vrsabhanu, and I will be
married nearby in the town of Yavata. My sole disposition and character shall
be that of a simple cowherd girl, and I shall not know any other mood. 


 


3)
I shall obtain my own eternal spiritual body, transcendental name, and specific
type of beauty and dress for the pleasure of Krsna. And when, by the power of
Sri Radha's causeless mercy, will I be allowed entrance into the pastimes of
divine love of Krsna?


 


4)
As I go with a water pot on my head to draw water from the Yamuna river, I
shall cherish remembrance of the mellows of conjugal love that unite Sri Radha
with Krsna. Thus being enchanted by Their divine love, I will madly sing the
glories of Sri Radha just like a raving lunatic.
