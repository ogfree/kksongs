LYRICS:


(1A)


All glories
to the chanting of Śrī K
ṛṣṇ
aÂ’s Holy Names!,


Which
easily extinguishes sa
ṁ
sāraÂ’s blazing flames 


By
polishing the lust-encrusted mirror of the heart.


That
chanting is the waxing moon that knows the secret art


Of causing
the white lotus of good fortune to unfurl


Its petals
far and wide throughout this bleak and blighted world.


Of
transcendental knowledge, which will take us to lifeÂ’s goal,


The
chanting of the name of K
ṛṣṇ
a is the life and soul.


 


(1B)


The ocean
of ecstatic bliss floods far beyond its bounds


Wherever K
ṛṣṇ
aÂ’s merciful and mystic Name
resounds.


Indeed,
whenever K
ṛṣṇ
aÂ’s Names are sung in congregation,


At every
step one tastes a joy that knows no limitation.


So hear
with great attention as I earnestly proclaim,


Just bathe
your consciousness by chanting K
ṛṣṇ
aÂ’s Holy Name!


By
transcendental potency that Name will surely bless


You with
pure love for K
ṛṣṇ
a and the end of all distress.


 


(2)


Â“K
ṛṣṇ
a,Â” Â“Govinda,Â” and Â“Keśava,Â”
tooÂ— 


Your Names
have no end, and in each of them You 


Have invested
Your potencies, leaving none out. 


Whenever we
want, we can chant them without 


The
slightest restriction of time or of place. 


O Lord, who
can fathom Your infinite grace? 


Yet I am so
wretched, devoid of all shame, 


That I
havenÂ’t developed a taste for Your Name.


 


(3)


More humble
than a blade of grass, more tolÂ’rant than a tree,


To think
Â“All praise belongs to others, none belongs to meÂ”Â—


These
qualities attract the Lord to bless one with the power


To chant
His Name incessantly until the final hour.


 


(4)


Wealth and
women, followers, the fruits of mundane piety,


Liberation
from this world of limitless anxietyÂ—


For Me, O
Lord, such common goals have not the slightest worth:


Let Me
serve You purely now and in each future birth.


 


(5)


Your servant
for eternity, I lost My true identity


And fell
into this horrid sea of birth and death, O Lord.


O NandaÂ’s
son, please hear My plea: By Your sweet grace consider Me


A speck of
dust upon Your lotus feet forevermore.


 


(6)


Tears
streaming from My eyes, My voice choked with bliss,


The hairs
upon My body standing up in happinessÂ—


When will
all these signs of rapture decorate My limbs


As I chant
your Holy Name, the monarch of all hymns?


 


(7)


Every
moment drags on for a million years or more;


From the
rain clouds of My eyes the tears in torrents pour;


This whole
creationÂ’s nothing but a vast and joyless voidÂ—


O Govinda!
By Your absence I am being destroyed!


 


(8A)


Let
Mādhava embrace this maid whoÂ’s fallen at His feet,


Or let Him
trample Me, or My most ardent hopes defeat


By never
giving Me a chance to see Him anywhere,


Thus
shattering My heart and plunging Me into despair.


 


(8B)


You see, He
is a reckless libertine and not a saint;


So let Him
act in any way He likes, without restraint.


Yet though
His cruel and crooked ways may cause Me constant woe,


K
ṛṣṇ
a is the only Lord My heart shall
ever know. 


 


(9)


These eight
essential verses Lord Caitanya wrote to teach


The
practice and the goal of chanting K
ṛṣṇ
aÂ’s Holy Name.


Day by day,
whoever chants or hears this hymn will reach


A little
closer to perfection, spotless K
ṛṣṇ
a-prem.
