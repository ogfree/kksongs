TRANSLATION


1-2)
Out of compassion for the fallen souls, Sri Krisna Caitanya came to this world
with His personal associates and divine abode to teach saranagati (the goal of
surrender), surrender to the almighty Godhead, and to freely distribute
ecstatic love of God, which is ordinarily very difficult to obtain. This
saranagati is the very life of the true devotee


 


3-4)
The ways of saranagati are humility, dedication of the self, acceptance of the
Lord as oneÂ’s only maintainer, faith that Krishna will surely protect,
execution of only those acts favorable to pure devotion, and renunciation of
conduct adverse to pure devotion.


 


5) The
youthful son of Nanda Maharaja, Sri Krishna, hears the prayers of anyone who
takes refuge in Him by this six-fold practice.


 


6-7) Bhaktivinoda
places a straw between his teeth, prostrates himself before the two Goswamis,
Sri Rupa and Sri Sanatana, and clasps their lotus feet with his hands. Â“I am
certainly the lowest of men.Â” he tells them weeping, Â“but please make me the
best of men by teaching me the ways of saranagatiÂ”
