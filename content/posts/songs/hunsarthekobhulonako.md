TRANSLATION


1) O
my dear mind! Please be alert and cautious -- do not forget the treasure that
is the principle of suddha sahaja tattva (pure natural truth as opposed to
bogus sahajiya tendency). Otherwise ultimately in the grip of Maya you will
perpetually weep. 


 


2) The
pure spirit soul is not material, O brother -- understand this correctly -- but
is actually a female sakhi living in Vrndavana. When the soul worships her Lord
Krsna-candra in this mood, then she becomes immersed in pure happiness,
incessantly tasting the sweetness of the madhura-rasa. 


 


3)
While still living within the material body, she engages in sadhana-bhakti
(regulated devotional service), developing detachment through the cultivation
of jnana (transcendental knowledge), and thus passes life in accordance with
religious principles. Such a devotee lives either at home or in the forest, and
remains engrossed in calling out the name "Krsna!" with single-minded
diligence. 


 


4) Verily
this is called sahaja-bhajan, or natural worship. It is conducted with a
purified mind, and is the one and only means for attaining Krsna. Whoever
deviates from this process by imposing their own concocted philosophy indeed
perishes; their activities are not bhajan. 


 


5)
This is the conviction of Cand Baul. The devotee of Lord Caitanya named Chota
Haridasa somehow embarked on an improper path; by the mercy of the Son of
mother Saci, he was cast away, alas, and did not again attain the lotus feet of
Gauranga.
