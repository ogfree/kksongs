LYRICS:


(1)


nitāi-pada-kamala,
koṭi-candra-suśītala

je chāyāy jagata jurāy

heno nitāi bine bhāi, rādhā-kṛṣṇa
pāite nāi

dṛḍha kori' dharo nitāir pāy


 


(2)


se
sambandha nāhi jā'r, bṛthā janma gelo tā'r

sei paśu boro durācār

nitāi nā bolilo mukhe, majilo saḿsāra-sukhe

vidyā-kule ki koribe tār


 


(3)


ahańkāre
matta hoiyā, nitāi-pada pāsariyā

asatyere satya kori māni

nitāiyer koruṇā habe, braje
rādhā-kṛṣṇa pābe

dharo nitāi-caraṇa du'khāni


 


(4)


nitāiyer
caraṇa satya, tāhāra sevaka nitya

nitāi-pada sadā koro āśa

narottama boro dukhī, nitāi more koro sukhī

rākho rāńgā-caraṇera pāśa


 


WORD
FOR WORD TRANSLATION: 
Nitai
Pada Kamala


 


TRANSLATION


1)
The lotus feet of Lord Nityananda are a shelter where one will get the soothing
moonlight not only of one, but of millions of moons. If the world wants to have
real peace, it should take shelter of Lord Nityananda. Unless one takes shelter
under the shade of the lotus feet of Lord Nityananda, it will be very difficult
for him to approach Radha-Krsna. If one actually wants to enter into the
dancing party of Radha-Krsna, he must firmly catch hold of the lotus feet of
Lord Nityananda.


 


2)
Anyone who has not established his relationship with Nityananda Prabhu is
understood to have spoiled his valuable human birth. Such a human being is
actually an uncontrollable animal. Because he never uttered the holy name of
Nityananda, he has become merged into so-called material happiness. What can
his useless education and family tradition do to help him?


 


3)
Being maddened after false prestige and identification with the body, one is
thinking, oh, what is Nityananda? What can He do for me? I don't care. The
result is that he is accepting something false to be truth. If you actually
want to approach the association of Radha-Krsna, you must first achieve the
mercy of Lord Nityananda. When He is merciful toward you, then you will be able
to approach Radha-Krsna. Therefore you should firmly grasp the lotus feet of
Lord Nityananda.


 


4)
The lotus feet of Nityananda are not illusion; they are a fact. One who engages
in the transcendental loving service of Nityananda is also transcendental.
Always try to catch the lotus feet of Lord Nityananda. This Narottama dasa is
very unhappy, therefore I am praying to Lord Nityananda to make me happy. My
dear Lord, please keep me close to Your lotus feet.
