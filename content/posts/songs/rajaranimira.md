TRANSLATION


Refrain:
The queen Mira is simply a beggar-woman, but only for Your sake, O Giridhari!


 


1) I
simply wander here and there like a mendicant, but I seek only the alms of Your
holy name.


 


2)
People say, Â“Mira has become a madwoman.Â” The King says, Â“She has disgraced her
family.Â” But Mira says, Â“O Lord Giridhari, my only desire is to remain at Your
lotus feet.Â”


 


3) In
this life, Mira has become unfortunate! Being separated by Syama, I have become
forever longing in separation. O Prabhuji! Kindly reveal Yourself to me! Mira
simply weeps for You, my Lord. Please donÂ’t make this most unfortunate person
cry any more. Please keep me tightly embraced, as if united with Your own body.


 


4) O
Giridhari! You are the life and soul of Mira! Only for Your sake, Giridhari!
