TRANSLATION


1) Look! Look! Look! Who is
this person with a fair complexion, with curved eyebrows and eyes with crooked
glances?
Â  
He cannot be 
NandaÂ’s
 
gopa
 son! He cannot be 
YasodaÂ’s
 beloved son! He cannot be the boy that robbed the 
gopis
 of their hearts!


 


2) In the past His hair was
glorious. Now His head is shaved. Now He wears a 
kaupina

and a 
sannyasiÂ’s
 garments. In the past He charmed the

gopis
Â’ hearts. In the past He played charming
melodies on his flute. Now He carries a 
sannyasiÂ’s
 
danda
.


 


3) In the past He sat under
a 
kadamba
 tree, placed the flute to His lips, and
played melodies that were actually songs chanting 
RadhaÂ’s

name. Now He stands by the 
GangaÂ’s
 banks, raises His
arms, and always sings in 
sankirtana
.


 


4) In the past He was the
teenage hero of amorous pastimes. In the past He enjoyed many pastimes with the

gopis
 in the middle of the forest. Now He wears the
garments of a 
sannyasi
. Accompanied by His
companions, He begs everyone to accept the chanting of KrishnaÂ’s holy names. 
Thus 
spake
 
Kanu


Das
.


 


REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:


This
is sung in Raga 
Suhai
.
