TRANSLATION


1)
Beyond the Viraja River lies the pure spiritual sky, and above that Vaikuntha
realm lies the divine abode known as Sri Goloka Vrndavana.


 


2) The
  land of Vrndavana is made of spiritual gems and is therefore likened to a
mine of fully cognizant and blissful jewels. This transcendentally conscious
realm is certainly a wonderful and extraordinary sight. Within that abode does
the most astonishing presence of Lord Krsna, who is compared to a tamal tree,
the king of trees possess the hue of a dark sapphire.


 


3)
Entwined upon that blackish tree a beautiful golden creeper has arisen, who is
the conqueror of all realms, being the supreme purifier. Her name is Mahabhava,
being the essence of the supreme pleasure-giving hladini potency. She is the enchantress
of Sri Krsna, who is Himself the enchanter of the three worlds.


 


4)
Known by the name of Radha, She remains shining there in great ecstasy, always
engaged in satisfying Govinda's heart. The leaves and flowers of that creeper
form the assembly of Her girlfriends headed by Lalita. Together She and all Her
friends entwine that blackish tree in a tight embrace.


 


5) At
the touch of this creeper, the tamal tree blooms; without the embrace of the
creeper, He can no longer exist.


 


6) The
creeper never desires to leave the company of the tamal tree; the creeper
perpetually craves Their union.


 


7)
Other than the meeting of these two, Bhaktivinoda desires nothing, but nothing
else.
