TRANSLATION


(Introductory
verse) Poet Kabir Das says, Â“When I was born, the world smiled and cried.
However, I will do such deeds that when I leave, I will be the one smiling and
the world will be the one crying.Â” 


 


(Refrain)
It is a very thin transparent shawl (representing life) that is drenched in the
holy name of Lord Rama, the Reservoir of Pleasure.


 


1) The
eight lotuses is the spinning wheel using the five earthly elements to make the
shawl (the body). In nine of ten days, the shawl is completed; however, the
fools will destroy it.


 


3)
When the shawl is completed, it is sent to the dyer (the spiritual master) to
color it. The dyer (the spiritual master) colored it as such that it is all red
(the color of self-realization).


 


3) Do
not have doubts or fears while wearing this shawl. It is only given to you for
two days and it is temporary too. The foolish people do not understand the
temporariness of this shawl, and they destroy it, day after day!


 


4)
Great devotees such as Dhruva Maharaja, Prahlad Maharaja, Sudama, and Sukadeva
Goswami have worn this chadar as well as purified their shawl as well other shawls
(souls). The servant, Kabir Dasa, is attempting to wear this shawl as given to
him originally by his guru.

this song, he sang it using the original tune. In verse 5, he went into a

Malkauns, Kafi, Basanta, and Bhairavi.
