TRANSLATION


Refrain:
All obeisances to You, O Ghana-syam!


 


1)
Taking refuge at Your lotus feet, now I will become fearless, O Lord! I will
cross the ocean of miseries by the boat of Your Holy Name.


 


2)
O Lord, we have fallen into sleep, while You are ever awake. Every moment we
can only make errors, our eyes being covered by illusion.


 


3)
Please remove this covering, my Lord, so I may behold Your form as the Divine
Couple, with Sri Radha by Your side. I will gaze at You until my hankering eyes
are pacified, thus fulfilling my soulÂ’s desire.
