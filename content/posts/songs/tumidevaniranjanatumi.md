TRANSLATION


1)
O Lord, You are untouched by matter. You are the destination of all. You are
Brahma. You are Siva.


 


2)
You are 
Candra
. You are 
Surya
.
You are the stars. You are 
Indra
. You are 
Varuna
. You are 
Agni
, the
purifier, who eats what is offered in the fire.


 


3)
You are the protector of the ten directions. You are the cause of all. You are
day and night. You hold a club as Your weapon.


 


4)
You are 
japa
. You are austerity. You are 
yajna
. You are charity. You are yoga. You are pleasure. You
are spiritual knowledge.


 


5)
You are 
Narayana
. You are the creator, maintainer,
and destroyer of the worlds. When You sleep, the worlds sleep. When You wake,
the worlds wake.


 


6)
You are untouched by matter. You are untouched by the three modes. Because You
love Your devotees, You have now entered a mother's womb.


 


7)
To kill 
Kamsa
 and the demons, and the relieve the
earth of her burden, You have now appeared in a humanlike form.


 


8)
After speaking these words, Brahma and the demigods bowed down to offer
respects. Then they returned to their cities.
