TRANSLATION


1) The Lord sets example Himself to
teach the spirit souls. The one who performs 
nirjana
 
bhajana
 simply cheats himself.


 


2) The world has now become full of

Jagais
 and 
Madhais
. The
dynasty of Lord 
Nityananda
 has increased its
following of disciples.


 


3) Eating, sleeping, wearing the
dress, and remaining unconcerned is not proper for 
Vaisnava
,
as this is without mercy.


 


4) According to the scripture Â“
Madhurya
 
Kadambini
Â” written by 
Srila
 
Visvanatha
 
Cakravarti
 
Thakura
, see what conclusion
is and what his judgment is.
