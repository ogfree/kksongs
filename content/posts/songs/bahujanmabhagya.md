TRANSLATION


Song 1:


1)
Glorifying the lotus feet of Sri Guru, Sri 
Gauracandra
,
the Youthful Couple of 
Vrndavan
 as well as of all the
residents of 
Vraja
, with a cheerful mind this 
Bhaktivinoda
 will now narrate the description of the mirror
which reflects the worship of those who strictly follow in the footsteps of 
Srila
 
Rupa
 
Gosvami
.


 


Song 2: 


1)
By the influence of extremely good fortune accrued for many, many births, the
desire awakens within the heart of a fortunate soul to taste the sweetness of
eternal transcendental mellows. Then, a strong inclination toward such a desire
forcibly brings that soul to Sri 
Vrndavana-dhama
,
where he becomes absorbed in the worship of Lord 
Krsna

which strictly follows the process outlined by 
Srila
 
Rupa
 
Gosvami
.


 


2)

Srila
 
Rupa
 
Gosvami
 has so kindly given us his valuable opinion and
taught the essential techniques for properly worshiping the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. Whoever tries to worship 
Krsna
 without
being aware of these methods will simply waste his entire life in useless
labor.


 


3)
Just for the sake of those who really want to understand this worship, I have
taken great care to humbly present this mirror of 
bhajana
,
although I am insignificant. If any of you are actually serious and
enthusiastic to render eternal service to Sri 
Sri
 
Radha-Krsna
 in the transcendental realm of 
Vraja
, then I request you now to please hear this narration
with great happiness.


 


4)
If one has intense greed and selfish eagerness for this process, presented
herein, then gradually his faith, then taste, and then full attachment in love
will all increase very, very quickly. One who has attained this platform of
worship in his own natural love and attachment has no need at all to bother
with scriptural rules and regulations, although in the primary, beginning stage
such practices are mandatory.


 


5)
Brothers, it is just like the affection of a mother for her son, which is
naturally fixed in her heart. She is inclined to care for her son by instinct.
But if someone else cares for the same child, they may not be as attentive as
the mother, so they might sometimes need to be reminded of their duty. So love
for Krsna is just like that. It is natural and wonderful for the 
nitya-siddha
 souls, whereas it is completely 
unmanifested
 and beyond the range of the 
nitya-baddha
 souls who are outside the purview of devotion.


 


6)
However, if one cultivates these spiritual instructions, then the flow of his
natural attachment and affection for the Lord is released. And when this
attachment reawakens and grows, then all the material bondage which entraps the
soul becomes severed, and this natural spiritual attachment will make him dance
in the transcendental 
ecstastic
 bliss of 
Vraja
 consciousness.
