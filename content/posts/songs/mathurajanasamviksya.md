TRANSLATION


1) O Lord 
Krsna
, the residents of 
Mathura
 became thus absorbed in seeing 
You
.
When 
You
 asked a washer man to give nice clothing to
You, and he refused, speaking harsh and insulting words, You casually
decapitated him (with Your hand).


 


2) O Lord 
Krsna
, You then nicely
dressed Your self in two nice garments selected from the 
washerman's

collection, Lord 
Balarama
 and the cowherd boys also
took what garments they wished and became jubilant.


 


3) O Lord 
Krsna
, please be merciful to
me. When a devotee-tailor brought to You exquisite, ornate and colorful
garments accompanied by ornaments, You donned those garments and appeared very
beautiful and opulent. (Very pleased, You gave a great spiritual) benediction
to that tailor.
