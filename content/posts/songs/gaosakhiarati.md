TRANSLATION


1)
O 
sakhi
, sing the 
arati
 of 
Priya
 and 
Pyare
! Sing of the
darling daughter of 
Vrsabhanu
! Sing of the lifter of 
Govardhana
 Hill, the enjoyer of the 
rasa
-dance!
Sing, o 
sakhi
, this 
arati
!


 


2)
Offer 
Them
 a golden tray decorated with camphor,
incense and a shining lamp. And while waving a 
camara

shout 
balihari
! (
bravo
!). O 
sakhi
, sing for He who performs pastimes in the 
kunjas
 and for that darling daughter of 
Vrsabhanu
!
Sing for 
Girivaradhari
 and 
Rasabihari
.
Sing, o 
sakhi
, this 
arati
!


 


3)
With a crown of peacock feather, dancing earrings and a forest flower garland,
the son of 
Nanda
 holds a flute to His lips while comfortably
sitting. Behold this splendid scene, o 
sakhi
, and
glorify 
Bankebihari
, 
Bhanudulari
,

Girivaradhari
 and 
Rasabihari
.
Sing, o 
sakhi
, this 
arati
!


 


4)
The beauty of the exquisite 
candrika
 
She
 wears upon Her head is beyond description. Her graceful
form is adorned with green sari. That eternally youthful, charming and playful
girl is from the 
village
 of 
Varsana
. Sing for 
Her
, the darling
daughter of 
Vrsabhanu
, and for the lifter of the best
of mountains, the enjoyer of the 
rasa
-dance. Sing, o 
sakhi
, this 
arati
!


 


5)
Sitting on a throne, 
They
 give Their love to all. They
eternally reside in the hearts of 
Their
 intimate,
loving devotees. They are the wealth and very life of 
Vraja
.
Therefore sing with all your heart, o 
sakhi
, for the
darling daughter of 
Vrsabhanu
, for the lifter of the
best of mountains, the enjoyer of the 
rasa
-dance.
Sing, o 
sakhi
, this 
arati
!
