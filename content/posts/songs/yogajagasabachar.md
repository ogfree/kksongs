TRANSLATION


1) Any type of yoga
exercise or external religious ceremony is completely useless and is no help at
all... for genuine faith is the only real substance. Whoever has such sincere
faith in his heart tastes one drop of transcendental nectar, and then he
gradually gains the right of admission into the entire ocean of ecstatic
devotional mellows (the 
Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu
)


 


2) By faithfully worshiping
the gods and goddesses who bestow knowledge and 
fruitive

results, with great care and attention, one gets only insignificant material
knowledge. On the other hand, by hearing the narration of topics concerning 
Krsna
 with rapt attention in the company of virtuous
devotees, one's transcendental conviction becomes completely fixed-up.


 


3) My friends! I call this
type of fixed-up conviction "
sraddha
",
which I continuously sing about and glorify in various ways. This 
sraddha
 is actually the 
bhakti-lata-bija

(the seed of the creeper of devotion). The 
fruitive

workers and the mental speculators have their own idea about what is 
sraddha
, which they advertise and proclaim again and again,
but in my opinion, their definition is without a doubt a misconception, and
does not constitute the real, transcendental 
sraddha
.
Whenever I hear such foolish disputes and misconceptions over mere names from
such unauthorized persons, it burns me up because that is just like mistaking
iron to be gold. Iron always remains 
iron,
 and can
never become gold unless and until it is touched by a transcendental
touchstone.


 


4) This touch-stone is
actually pure devotional service to Lord 
Krsna
. By
the mere touch of this transcendental gem, the iron-mine of faith in 
fruitive
 action and philosophical wrangling turns into
golden ecstatic loving faith in the Lord. The weight of this type of gold certainly
outweighs all materialistic delusions. This is the real power of the touch-
stone of 
Krsna-bhakti
.
