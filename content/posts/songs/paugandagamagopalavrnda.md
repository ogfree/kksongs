TRANSLATION


1)
O Krsna, o auspiciousness of 
Vrndavana
. As a young
boy you wander in the 
forest
 of 
Vrndavana
, accompanied by 
Your
 elder
brother (Lord 
Balarama
).


 


2)
O Krsna, You are greatly delighted by the forest 
Vrndavana

and 
You
 are expert in many different exchanges of
love.


 


3)
O Krsna, Please protect me. You are as lustrous as a bumble-bee and 
Your
 words eclipse the warbling of the cuckoos. You walk as
gracefully as the swans and 
Your
 dancing is as
beautiful s the dancing of the peacocks.


 


4)
O Krsna, You delight in hearing the sound of the echo and 
You

are expert at climbing the branches of trees. You call the cows by their
individual names and 
You
 wear a sacred thread and
carry a rope.


 


5)
O Krsna, You become jubilant by the pastime of mock-fighting with 
Your
 friends, and You perform various services to remove the
fatigue of Your friend 
Balabhadra
. You are expert at
praising the cowherd boys and 
You
 become free from
weariness by staying under the shade of a tree.


 


6)
O Krsna, You sometimes take rest on a bed fashioned from blossoming flowers,
with the laps of cowherd boys 
Your
 pillow. Another
cowherd boy then massages 
Your
 feet, and another fans
You.


 


7)
O Krsna, listening to the singing of the cowherd boys, 
You

sleep very happily. Your pastimes 
inthe
 village of 
Vrndavana
 eclipses the grandest opulence. The 
forest
 of 
Vrndavana
 is covered with the marks of 
Your

feet, which are worshiped by the 
gopis
.
