TRANSLATION


Refrain:
Please allow me to see You, Giridhari! I have given up myself to Your enchanting
face!


 


1)
On the banks of the Yamuna River, You tend the cows! You play very sweet melodies
on Your flute! You have blanket draped over Your shoulder. 


 


2)
He is adorned with a crown with a peacock feather on His head and appears
resplendent with His yellow cloth. This form of His attracts the minds of
saintly persons. Your ear-rings dazzle in a splendorous way!


 


3)
You sport and relish mellows in Vrndavana. The cowherd boys and girls accompany
you and sing to Your loving melodies from Your ankle bells.
