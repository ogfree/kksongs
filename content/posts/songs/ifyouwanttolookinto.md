LYRICS:


(1)


If you
want to look in the mysteries of life


YouÂ’ve
had enough of serving the senses and the mind


All
that youÂ’re doing only helps to bring you down


There
must have been something higher than what you have found


Ignorance
has set the pace in this degraded human race


Running,
running, running out of time


This
use of human life is such a crime


Within
theseÂ…


 


(Refrain)


Bubbles
in a cosmic ocean


The
rajas in the sanding sea


Apparitions
dancing before our faulty visions


Simply
flashes in a cosmic dream


Reality
is not what it seems


 


(2)


If you
want to look in the mysteries of life


Understanding
who formed the universe is energized?


How
has the whole creation taken place?


Is
there any people beyond this time and space?


The
answers are here, the human nature is very clear


Just
understand that true identity.


Being
servant spirit souls eternally


Not
justÂ…


 


(Refrain)


Bubbles
in a cosmic ocean


The
rajas in the sanding sea


Apparitions
dancing before our faulty visions


Simply
flashes in a cosmic dream


Reality
is not what it seems


 


(3)


If you
want to understand the truth of what is life


What
lies beyond this birth and death, how can I realize?


The
nature of the self revealed, tell me who I am?


The
spirit soul engaged in a master mind and plan


WhoÂ’s
controlling me? The humans found reality


The
mystery revealed by the wise


Enlightened
associate through the LordÂ’s disguise


Beyond
theseÂ…


 


(Refrain)


Bubbles
in a cosmic ocean


The
rajas in the sanding sea


Apparitions
dancing before our faulty visions


Simply
flashes in a cosmic dream


Reality
is not what it seems


 


Bubbles
in a cosmic ocean


The
rajas in the sanding sea


Apparitions
dancing before our faulty visions


Simply
flashes in a cosmic dream


ItÂ’s
all about to burst at the seas
