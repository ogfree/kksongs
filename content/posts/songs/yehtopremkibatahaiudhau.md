LYRICS:


(1)


yeh to
prema kī bāta hai udhau


bandagī
tere bas kī nahīń hai


yahāń
sarade ke hońṭh hai saude


aśiqī
itnī sastī nahīń hai


 


(2)


premawāloń
ne kab waqt pūchā


unkī
pūjā sunale he udhau


yah dam dam
meń hote hai pūjā


sar
jhukānā ke fursat nahīń hai


 


(3)


jo asar hai
meń mastī meń ḍūbe


unhe
kyā paravāha zindagī kī


jo
utartī hai kartī yeh mastī


voh
haqīqat ke mastī nahīń hai


 


(4)


jiske
nazaroń meń hai śyāma pyāre


woh to
rehte hai jaga se nihāre


jiske
nazaroń meń mohana samāye


woh nazar
phir tarastī nahīń hai


 


TRANSLATION


1)
This is on the topic of Divine Love, O Udhau! This is not a topic you will be
able to understand. Here, the business of understanding Krsna is by lips. Love
is not so cheap here!


 


2)
When have lovers ever asked for worship? O Udhau, please listen! Here, worship
here is done in excitement and vigor! Here, lowering and bowing heads does not
cause grief!


 


3) The
effect of drowning in such fun, who can care about life? If one indulges in
material life and tries to examine our fun, then this fun is not real.


 


4)
WhomeverÂ’s eyes have the desire for my loving Syama, they live in the world
without any cares of it. For whoeverÂ’s eyes is buried in the love of Krsna,
those eyes will never get thirsty again!
