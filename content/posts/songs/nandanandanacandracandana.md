TRANSLATION


1)
The fragrance of 
Krsna's
 limbs eclipses the fragrance
of sandal paste and camphor. Lord 
Krsna
 is more
glorious than the monsoon clouds. His neck is more graceful than the 
conchshell
. He is more handsome than an ocean of
handsomeness.


 


2)

Gokula's
 cowherd people all love Him. The saintly
beautiful 
gopis
 dearly love Him. He is decorated with
many flowers. He is graceful and charming. He stays in a forest cottage.


 


3)
Earrings adorn the circles of His cheeks. He wears a peacock-feather crown. He
playfully dances. He is expert in a host of graceful rhythms. His arms are
great maces.


 


4)
His eyes are lotus flowers. He frees the devotees from a host of sins. His
words delight the ear. 
Govinda
 
dasa

takes shelter of His soft and splendid flower-bud feet.
