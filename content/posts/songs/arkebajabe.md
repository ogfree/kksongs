TRANSLATION


Refrain:
Now that Syama has left Braja, who else will play the flute?


 


1)
Since Syama has left Braja, the beautiful lotus-like Radharani is so unhappy
that She is constantly weeping.


 


2)
While decorating a forest bower with wildflowers, Radharani exclaims, Â“My dear
friend, all night I lie awake weeping and trembling, because Syama will not be
coming. He is no longer in Braja!Â”


 


3) Due
to separation of Syama both male and female parrots are weeping, along with the
cowherd girls of Braja. Syama is no longer playing the flute and the cows no
longer go out to the pasture. Â“My dear friend, our life and soul, Krsna, has
left Braja!Â”
