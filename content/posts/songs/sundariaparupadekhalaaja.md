TRANSLATION


(Refrain)
The beautiful 
gopi
 looked at the wonderful
arrangement. Yearning to meet Krsna, she took no care that the ornaments were
proper or not.


 


1)
With both hands she carefully placed jewel anklets on her feet. She placed a
necklace on her neck and an ornament on her head.


 


2)
The night was dark like black 
kajjala
. The clouds
thundered and rained. Snakes slithered on the path. Leaving her home, she
walked all alone.


 


3)
She was filled with longing. 
Kama
 was her only companion. She did not care if she
walked on the path or on the places where there was no path. 
Govinda
 
dasa
 says: This 
vraja-gopi
 certainly met Lord Krsna.
