TRANSLATION



Introductory
verse: I offer my repeated obeisances unto Vrnda, Srimati Tulasi Devi, who is
very dear to Lord Kesava. O goddess, you bestow devotional service to Lord Visnu
and possess the highest truth.


 


1)
O Tulasi, beloved of Krsna, I bow before you again and again. My desire is to
obtain the service of Sri Sri Radha-Krsna. 


 


2)
Whoever takes shelter of you has his wishes fulfilled. Bestowing your mercy on
him, you make him a resident of Vrndavana. 


 


3)
My desire is that you will also grant me a residence in the pleasure groves of
Sri Vrndavana-dhama. Thus, within my vision I will always behold the beautiful
pastimes of Radha and Krsna. 


 


4)
I beg you to make me a follower of the cowherd damsels of Vraja. Please give me
the privilege of devotional service and make me your own maidservant. 


 


5)
Dina Duhkhi Krsnadasa prays, ''May I always swim in the love of Sri Radha and
Govinda. 


 


6)*
By the circumambulation of Srimati Tulasi Devi all the sins that one may have
committed are destroyed at every step, even the sin of killing a brahmana.
