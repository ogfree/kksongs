TRANSLATION


(Refrain) Glory to 
Saci's
 son! The three worlds bow before Him. He breaks into
shards everyone's fear of the black snake that is Kali-
yuga
.



 


1) Lord 
Gaura's

handsome form defeats the golden mountain and the golden 
campaka

flowers. His neck is long. His glory has no end. He charms the world's hearts.


 


2) The hairs of His body stand
erect. His heart is overcome with the ecstasy of spiritual love. He gently,
gently smiles. He speaks broken words in a choked voice. How many celestial 
Gangas
 flow from His eyes?


 


3) Tasting the nectar of
ecstatic spiritual love, He dances. His eyes move restlessly. How many devotees
gather around Him and sing? He makes the circle of the earth float in the
nectar of ecstatic spiritual love. 
Govinda
 
dasa
 alone was not touched by that flood of nectar.


 


REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:


This
song is sung in Raga
