TRANSLATION


(Refrain) O 
Krsna
, this saintly girl is now overcome. Her heart is
wounded. Day and night she weeps. She thinks and thinks of 
Your

host of virtues.


 


1) Meeting her friends
there, a girl fair like gold enjoyed many pastimes in 
Vrndavana

forest. Then the poison of 
Your
 sweet glance made her
burst into flames. At once she became filled with thoughts of dark 
Krsna
.


 


2) Her elders know nothing
of her plight. He friends don't know what to do. Unknown to others, she is
ravaged by a terrible affliction. What medicine, what mantra should we use to
cure this jewel of a girl? Her eyes are now closed in a trance of 
samadhi
.


 


3) Moment after moment her
body is bent and crumpled. Bewildered, she speaks nonsense. Hearing the name 
Syama
", she becomes startled and trembles. How can 
Govinda
 
dasa
 know what to do?


 


REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:


This
song is heard in Raga 
Dhanasri
