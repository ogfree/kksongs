TRANSLATION


1)
I pray that the wild horse of my heart may become like the cintamani-jewel
horse Srila Rupa Gosvami, which carries as its rider the desire to serve the
gopa-prince's beloved. 


 


2)
Because of Srila Rupa Gosvami's efforts my heart is now peaceful, controlled,
able to know the nature of spirit, fixed in yoga, and attached to the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. Now that I have attained Srila Rupa Gosvami's smiling,
nectarean, compassionate glance, my heart has become wild by remembering the
transcendental pastimes of Lord Hari.


 


3)
O does playing in the forest, you are all very fortunate because with your eyes
you always drink the nectar of Lord Krsna's face. As for myself, I am simply an
unlucky dog wandering in Vraja trying to fill my belly. I never see Lord Krsna
for even a moment.


 


4)
O friend, when you serve Vraja's king and queen, who many times have met in my
heart, please give the remnants of Their betelnuts to me. 


 


5)
O friend, I see you serving Sri Radha' who, languid from many passionate
amorous pastimes, and Her cheeks wet with perspiration, rests on the couch of
Lord Krsna's chest.    


 


6)
May the splendid moon of Lord Krsna, which tirelessly dispels the great
darkness of the demons, showers the nectar of pure love on the devotees, cools
the white lotus of Sri Radha, and makes the flowers of Her breasts blossom with
happiness, protect us.     


 


7)
At what very auspicious time will I directly see Sri Sri Radha-Krsna enjoying the
sweet rasa dance, arguing over some yogurt at the base of a hill, and playing
with Their friends in waves of joking words pushed by breezes of amorous
desire? 


 


(8)
May Krsna, the leader of the cowherd boys who, as He walks on the path with His
friends and surabhi cows, with happiness and concern offers hundreds of
blessings to Rohini-devi and the other devotees, and who, as the concerned
queen of Vraja tearfully glances at His friends and at the lion like Balarama,
is gazed at with love and pride by the people of Vraja and with words of praise
by Radha' and His other gopi beloveds, protect us.


 


(9)


   
"Friend, who is this girl We have never seen before?" 


   
"She is a vraja-gopi?"


   
"From where has she come? Why has she come?"


   
"She has come from Mathura-pura to worship You."


 


   
When She heard the playful words "Now You may enjoy with the incomparable
Lord Hari" Radha understood that the girl was Krsna in disguise and at
once burst into a smile.


 


(10) 
O tongue tortured by thirst, please me with the delicious nectar of the name
Radha with the wonderfully sweet condensed milk of the name Krsna, add the
fragrant ice of pure love and drink this charming drink at every
moment!     


 


(11)
O moon of Lord Caitanya, please make the lotus of my heart bloom! Please make
that lotus beautiful with swarms of dancing bumblebees of meditation upon You!
Please shake away the dense darkness of my offenses! O kind Lord, please make
sinful me drink the nectar of Your feet! 


 


12)
I pray that I may fan the two young dancers of Vraja who have become fatigued
by happily dancing in Cupid's arena in an incomparable forest grove filled with
the instrumental music of the expert cuckoos and the humming songs of the bees.


 


13)
On the strength of the service I have done to the pollen of his lotus feet, I
am able to always reside, even in times of trouble, by the shore of Radha-kunda
at the base of Govardhana Hill. Protected by his friends, I chant and hear Sri
Sri Radha-Mukunda's holy names, which defeat the sweetest nectar. I pray that
Srila Rupa Gosvami may always protect me.
