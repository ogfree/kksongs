TRANSLATION


1)
At the base of 
Their
 favorite hill, the youthful
divine couple pretended to quarrel over 
Krsna's
 claim
to collect a toll of yogurt and milk-products. The arrogant joking words of 
Radha's
 friends made the divine couple blossom with happiness.
I pray that I may reside at Dana-
sarovara
, the
witness of this 
dana-keli
 pastime.


 


2)
Because Sri 
Krsna
 enjoyed the 
dana-keli

pastime in a secluded place by the shore of this lake, it has become known as
Dana-
sarovara
. The truth of this lake remains hidden
to persons averse to 
the mellows
 of pure devotional
service. Only the devotees have the power to understand it. I pray that I may
reside at Dana-
sarovara
, where the divine 
couple enjoy
 the 
dana-keli

pastime.


 


3)
It is beautiful with the graceful pastimes of many birds. It is cool, fragrant
with many charming lotuses, and filled with the sounds of swarms of bees
intoxicated by the aroma of fresh honey. I pray that I may reside at Dana-
sarovara
, where the divine 
couple enjoy

the 
dana-keli
 pastime.


 


4)
It is filled with cool water fragrant with many flowers. It blossoms with good
fortune attained from the peerless water-pastimes of the youthful divine couple
and 
Their
 sweet friends. I pray that I may reside at
Dana-
sarovara
, where the divine 
couple
enjoy
 the 
dana-keli
 pastime.


 


5)
It is filled with the fragrance of newly-blossomed flowers. Everyone there is
pleased by the singing of the birds and bees. It is surrounded by groves of
splendid trees. I pray that I may reside at Dana-
sarovara
,
where the divine 
couple enjoy
 the 
dana-keli

pastime.


 


6)
Accompanied by Their affectionate young friends, the divine couple enters the
nearby forest groves filled with newly-blossoming flowers and humming bees and
enjoys incomparable ever-fresh pastimes there. I pray that I may reside at
Dana-
sarovara
, where the divine 
couple
enjoy
 the 
dana-keli
 pastime.


 


7)
By deeply drinking its water, birds, animals, cows, and humans become at once
filled with a host of transcendental virtues. I pray that I may reside at Dana-
sarovara
, where the divine 
couple enjoy

the 
dana-keli
 pastime.


 


8)
Every day, as he converses with His friends, the moon of the 
gopas
 makes the 
surabhi
 cows
drink its sweet, aromatic, and cold water, and when they have finished, He
Himself drinks. I pray that I may reside at Dana-
sarovara
,
where the divine 
couple enjoy
 the 
dana-keli

pastime.


 


9)
An intelligent and self-controlled person who reads these eight verses
glorifying the Dana-
sarovara
 lake will enter the
eternal spiritual world and directly see the 
dana

pastimes of Sri 
Sri
 
Radha'-Krsna
.
