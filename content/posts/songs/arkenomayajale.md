TRANSLATION


1) O
fish like soul, why have you fallen into the entangling nets of Maya? You have
not understood that being bound up by those nets you will have to remain in
this material world for a long, long time.


 


2)
After becoming captive in MayaÂ’s snare due to your desires for insignificant
enjoyments, you remain transformed in a spiritually diseased condition,
punishable just like a disobedient servant.


 


3)
Now, by the power of devotional service, always remain subservient to Lord
Krsna, swimming and frolicking freely in the nectarine ocean of Krsna-prema.
