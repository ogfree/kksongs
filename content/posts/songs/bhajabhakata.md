WORD
FOR WORD TRANSLATION: 
Bhaja Bhakata
Vatsala Sri Gaurahari


 


TRANSLATIONÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â  


1)
Just worship Sri Gaurahari, who is always affectionate toward His devotees. He
is the same Supreme Godhead, Krsna, who sported in the cowherd pastures of
Vraja and stole the hearts of Nanda and Yasoda. Just worship Govinda, Govinda,
Gopala!


 


2)
Mother Yasoda calls to Krsna, "My dear Damodara, it is very late. Please
come right now, sit down in the dining hall, and take Your lunch." 


 


3) On
the direction of Nanda Maharaja, Krsna, the holder of Govardhana Hill, sits
down, and then all the cowherd boys, along with Krsna's elder brother, Sri
Baladeva, sit down in rows to take their lunch. 


 


4)
They are then served a feast of sukta and various kinds of green leafy
vegetables, then nice fried things, and a salad made of the green leaves of the
jute plant. They are also served pumpkin, baskets of fruit, small square cakes
made of lentils and cooked down milk, then thick yogurt, squash cooked in milk,
and vegetable preparations made from the tower of the banana tree. 


 


5)
Then they receive fried squares of mung dahl patties, and urad dahl patties,
capatis, and rice with ghee. Next, sweets made with milk, sugar and sesamum,
rice flour cakes; thick cooked-down milk; cakes floating in milk; and sweet
rice. 


 


6)
There is also sweet rice that tastes just like nectar due to its being mixed
with camphor. There are bananas, and cheese which is nectarean and delicious.
They are also served twelve kinds of sour preparations made with tamarinds,
limes, lemons, oranges, and pomegranates. 


 


7)
There are puns made with white flour and sugar; puns filled with cream; laddus;
and dahl patties boiled in sugared rice. Krsna eagerly eats all of the food. 


 


8) In
great ecstasy and joy Krsna eats the rice, curried vegetables, sweets, and
pastries cooked by Srimati Radharani. 


 


9)
Krsna's funny brahmana friend Madhumangala, who is very fond of Laddus, gets
them by hook or by crook. Eating the laddus he shouts, "Haribol!
Haribol!~' and makes a funny sound by swapping his sides under his armpits with
his hands. 


 


10)
Beholding Radharani and Her gopifriends out of the courters of His eyes, Krsna
eats at the house of mother Yasoda with great satisfaction. 


 


11)
After lunch, Krsna drinks rose-scented water. Then all of the boys, standing in
lines, wash their mouths. 


 


12)
After all the cowherd boys wash their hands and mouths; in great bliss they
take rest with Lord Balarama. 


 


13) The
two cowherd boys Jambula and Rasala then bring Krsna pan made with betel nuts,
fancy spices, and catechu. After eating that pin, Sri Krsnacandra then happily
goes to sleep. 


 


14)
While Krsna happily takes His rest on an excellent bedstead, His servant
Visalaksa cools Him with a fan of peacock feathers. 


 


15) At
mother Yasoda's request the gopi, Dhanistha, brings remnants of food left on
Krsna's plate to Srimati Radharani, who eats them with great delight 


 


16)
Lalita-devi and the other gopis then receive the remnants, and within their
hearts they sing the glories of Radharani and Krsna with great joy. 


 


17)
Thakura Bhaktivinoda, whose one and only Joy is the pastimes of Lord Hari,
sings this Bhoga-arati song
