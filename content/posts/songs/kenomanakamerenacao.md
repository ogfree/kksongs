TRANSLATION


1) Tell me why, my dear
mind? Why are you forced to dance by lust, and why do you think that such
dancing is 
Krsna
 conscious? Your lust is simply
abounding in skin and meat, and you are addicted to non-stop material sense
gratification. Thus you factually spend your time in running here and there,
chasing after worldly sense objects.


 


2) The soul's original
eternal nature is pure love within the innermost core of its spiritually
conscious form, and the sole object of repose for that pure love is Lord 
Hari
. Alas, how lamentable it is, that this inherent
ecstatic love is now lying in a dormant, sleeping state due to the artificial
covering of this temporary lust, My dear mind, banishing this lust to a distant
place, just rouse and reawaken your sleeping 
prema
.


 


3) Only in the following
sequence does pure love for 
Krsna
 awaken: First one
develops 
sraddha
 (faith) in the process of 
Krsna
 Consciousness; then, due to that faith one becomes
enthusiastic for 
sadhu-sanga
 (the association of devotees);
then, by performance of 
bhajana-kriya
 (devotional
worship) in the company of the devotees there awakens 
nista

(steadiness in service), then 
ruci
 (taste), then 
asakti
 (attachment to the Lord); this attachment then gives
rise to 
bhava
 (genuine ecstatic emotions), from which

prema
 (pure love for 
Krsna
)
manifests its re-awakening. Only in this sequence does 
prema

come into being.


 


4) One who endeavors for
this bona fide process gets the essence of pure ecstatic love for 
Krsna
. One who neglects the proper order of this procedure
does not experience the reawakening of pure 
prema
. My
dear mind, why are you maintaining the wicked mentality of apprehension and
fear of this bona fide method of devotional practice? By cultivation of your
lust in this mundane sphere, you will never be able to touch upon genuine
ecstatic love for 
Krsna
.


 


5) So by the likes of your
dramatic performance of dancing in lust, you think that this is indicative of
your 
prema
, but it is actually a deceptive, feigned
imitation of 
prema
. Thus you whole process is simply
gross sense gratification. My dear brother, always reject such degraded,
contemptible sense gratification, casting out this grave offense to the Lord.
