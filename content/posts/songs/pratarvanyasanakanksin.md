TRANSLATION


1) O 
Krsna
,
desiring to take breakfast as a picnic in the forest, You called the cowherd
boys by sounding Your buffalo-horn bugle, and went (to the forest) accompanied
by unlimited calves and boys.


 


2) O 
Krsna
,
when one cowherd boy playfully stole another's lunch-bag, and when the clever
cowherd boys played other games, such as the contest to see who could first
touch 
Your
 lotus-feet, You became greatly pleased and
jubilant.


 


3) O 
Krsna
,
You were always associated with 
Your
 contemporary
friends, who could not for a moment even, understand Your supernatural prowess,
and whose good fortune was glorified by 
Sukadeva
 
Gosvami
.


 


REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:


This
song is based on 
Srimad
 
Bhagavatam

Canto 10 Chapter 12.
