TRANSLATION


1)
Sweet, sweet is the youthful 
Gaura
. Sweet, sweet is
His dancing. Sweet, sweet 
are
 all His companions.
Sweet, sweet is His marketplace.


 


2)
Sweet, sweet are the sounds of the 
mrdangas
. Sweet,
sweet is the rhythms. His devotees are wild with the sweet nectar of ecstatic
spiritual love. Sweet, sweet is their singing.


 


3)
Sweet is His leaning on a companion and sweet is His swaying to and fro. Sweet,
sweet 
are
 His motions. Sweet, sweet 
are

His beautiful words. Sweet, sweet is His effulgent glory.


 


4)
Sweet are His lips that defeat the moon. Sweet, sweet is His laughter. Sweet is
His 
arati
, His ecstatic spiritual love, and his
character. Sweet, sweet is His talking.


 


5)
Sweet are his reddish eyes. Sweet are His sidelong glances. But 
Sekhar
 Ray has not attained His sweet loving service.
