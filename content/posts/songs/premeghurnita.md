TRANSLATION


1)
Your eyes are rolling in ecstasy as You cast furtive glances. Defeating nectar,
Your face is as effulgent and beautiful as the full moon. You are the reservoir
of all transcendental qualities. O Nityananda Prabhu, I glorify You again and
again. You are the beloved of Vasudha and Jahnava. Please give me the shelter
of Your lotus feet.


 


2)
Your earrings, brilliant as the sun, dangle playfully upon Your attractive
cheeks. O Prabhu! Maddened bumblebees hover above and drink the honey from the
fragrant malati garland decorating Your limbs. O Nityananda Prabhu, I glorify
You again and again. You are the beloved of Vasudha and Jahnava. Please give me
the shelter of Your lotus feet.


 


3)
Your long graceful arms hang down to Your knees, and they conquer the beauty of
the trunk of an intoxicated elephant. With a thundering voice reverberating
throughout the ten directions You cry out, Â‘O brother, O brother! Where are
You?Â’ The hearts of all the residents from the hellish regions to the heavenly
planets are attracted by Your irresistable beauty. O Nityananda Prabhu, I
glorify You again and again. You are the beloved of Vasudha and Jahnava. Please
give me the shelter of Your lotus feet.


 


4)
Sometimes in ecstasy You dance blissfully and roar so loudly that the vibration
conquers the rumbling of clouds. From Your waistÂ—which is as thin as a lionÂ’s
waist or a damru drumÂ—hangs a beautiful blue silken cloth. Whenever You run
swiftly along the bank of the Ganges the earth trembles below the caress of
Your lotus feet. O Nityananda Prabhu, I glorify You again and again. You are
the beloved of Vasudha and Jahnava. Please give me the shelter of Your lotus
feet.


 


5)
You have completely inundated the entire universe with the clouds of Your
ecstasy. No one, be he miserable, poor, downtrodden, quarrelsome or sinful can
escape the flood of Your mercy. Your beautiful lotus feet are softer than a
tender green leaf. The beelike devotees always drink the sweet nectar flowing
from Your lotus feet. O Nityananda Prabhu, I glorify You again and again. You
are the beloved of Vasudha and Jahnava. Please give me the shelter of Your
lotus feet.


 


6)
Your jeweled anklebells move gently and tinkle sweetly. The soles of Your
incomparably pure and soft lotus feet radiate a reddish hue resembling two
beautiful lotus flowers. The cooling rays of the full moon have left the
heavens to reside beneath Your lotus feet and emanate a shimmering effulgence
from Your toenails. O Nityananda Prabhu, I glorify You again and again. You are
the beloved of Vasudha and Jahnava. Please give me the shelter of Your lotus
feet.


 


7)
Out of fear of You the snake of Kali fled far away, thus making everyone happy.
As the rising sun dispels the fear of darkness and gives life to the lotus
flower, Your appearance removes everyoneÂ’s fear of their sinful reactions and
gives new life and hope to Bhumi (Mother Earth), who was suffering greatly from
the burden of those sins. O Nityananda Prabhu, I glorify You again and again.
You are the beloved of Vasudha and Jahnava. Please give me the shelter of Your
lotus feet.


 


8)
With a slight smile radiating from Your lotus face You attract all beautiful
girls. Who can understand the ecstatic emotions You relish when You fall to the
ground in a swoon? Your lips tremble and sometimes You cry as You raise Your
hands over Your head. O Nityananda Prabhu, I glorify You again and again. You
are the beloved of Vasudha and Jahnava. Please give me the shelter of Your
lotus feet.
