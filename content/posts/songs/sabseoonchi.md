WORD
FOR WORD TRANSLATION: 
Sabse
Umci Prema Sagai


 


TRANSLATION


Refrain:
Of all forms of worship of the Lord, love is the highest.


 


1)
Lord Krsna renounced the delicacies that Duryodhana offered, and ate vegetables
at ViduraÂ’s house.


 


2)
As Lord Ramacandra, He ate fruits which were already filled with love from
Sabari.


 


3)
Love is indeed the best way to serve and please the Lord.


 


4)
In Maharaja YuddhistiraÂ’s Rajasuya Yajna sacrifice, Lord Krsna served the
brahmanas and picked up their eating utensils.


 


5)
Out of pure love for Arjuna, He took the position of being his charioteer, and
He forgot that He was the Lord.


 


6)
Such love did Lord Krsna portray in Vrndavana when He danced with the gopis in
the rasa lila.


 


7)
The harsh Suradasa is not worthy to praise the merciful and magnanimous Lord.
