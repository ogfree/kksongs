TRANSLATION


1)
O My All Pervading dear Lord Visnu! Please remove my haughtiness and destroy my
pride. Kindly control my mind. Quench my insatiable thirst for mirage like
illusory pleasures of the world. Spread compassion widely in my heart for all
souls in Your creation. And please rescue my soul from the endless ocean of
continuous birth and death. 


 


2)
O My Lord Hari, the Beloved of Sri (Laksmi)! My sincere salutations to Your
Holy Lotus Feet! Your feet are like the beautiful, tender, fragrant, nectar
filled Lotus flowers! The nectar is in reality is Ganga Devi, which has its
origin from Your Divine Feet. 


The
fragrance of Your Transcendental feet is the full of truth, knowledge, and
bliss. The bliss bestowed upon the souls by Your Lotus feet is the mitigation
of the sorrows and fears of mundane world. 


 


3)
O My Beloved Lord!  It is very true that the waves belong to their origin,
the ocean, though they seem to appear different from the ocean simultaneously. Qualitatively
there is no difference between the ocean and the waves. But still there exists
the difference. Since the origin, sustainer, and destroyer of the waves is the
ocean, waves cannot exist without the ocean. Similarly, there is simultaneous
oneness and difference between the spirit soul and Supersoul, Thus, I can say
that there is no difference between us as I only exist in relation to You.
Truly speaking, I belong to You and You are my origin, sustainer, and destroyer
but never vice versa. 


 


4)
O my dear Lord Krsna! You have lifted Govardhana Hill on Your little finger to
save Your devotees! You have appeared as Lord Vamanadeva, the distant brother
of Indra, the King of demigods, to rescue him.  You have vanquished many
demoniac and atheistic persons at different times! Your eyes are like the most
powerful blazing Sun and the most pleasant and coolest Moon! With all these
considerations in mind, there is no doubt that Your mere Graceful Glance itself
is capable of dispelling all my worldly attachments! So, kindly look at me at
least once with Your merciful eyes! 


 


5)
O Supreme Lord of the Universe! You have always assumed many different Divine
Forms like the Lord Matysadeva (the fish incarnation), Lord Kurmadeva (the
tortoise incarnation), Lord Nrsimhadeva, and Lord Varahadeva just to save the
Mother Earth from many calamities. Now, You can easily rescue me also from the
material existence. Please My Lord, save me, as I am extremely fearful and
anxious! 


 


6)
O my dear Lord Damodara! O Temple of Divine Attributes! O Govinda,
Transcendental joy of all the senses! O Beautiful Lotus-faced Lord! O Capable
Destroyer of the Ocean of Birth and Death! O My Supreme Personality of Godhead!
Please extinguish all my fears about this distressful mundane existence. 


 


7)
O My Lord Narayana! You are full of unlimited Grace. I sincerely take refuge at
Your Lotus Feet. Let this glorious lotus-like six-versed prayer, entitled the
Bumble-bee (Satpadi) reside for ever on my mouth!
