TRANSLATION


1) This gorgeous boy is the darling
child of mother Saci, dancing in the kirtana of chanting Lord HariÂ’s names. His
forehead is adorned with drawings of sandalwood paste, and His enchanting locks
of hair are shining in a splendorous fashion as they bounce upon His cheeks.


 


2) His hair is wrapped in a topknot,
and a garland of forest flowers sways upon His chest. Wearing brilliant yellow
silken garments, He dances with ankle bells tinkling upon His feet.


 


3) Sri Sri Radha and Krsna have become
joined in one body, and together They play a flute within the grove of
Nidhuvana. In this mood, the Lord of Visvarupa has come and manifested Himself
in the town of Nadiya.


 


4) Someone in that kirtana sings the
names of Radha and Krsna, someone else sings songs of Lord HariÂ’s
transcendental qualities, while others play the auspicious rhythms of the sweet
and relishable mrdanga drums. All this takes place in that spectacular
performance.
