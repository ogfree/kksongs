LYRICS:


(1)


Glory
to the son of Vraja's king!


Glory
to the master of all Glory


To the
rake who dances in a dancing ring


Of
graceful girls Glory to Him the story


 


(2)


Of
whose charming pastimes fills each saintly heart


With
bliss Glory to the master of all powers.


Glory
to the boy whose every limb and part


Is
graceful like a million lotus flowers.


 


(3)


Glory
to His lotus hands and feet.


Glory
to His restless smiling eyes.


Glory
to His heart with mercy sweet.


Glory
to the clear and sweet and wise


 


(4)


Words
He kindly in the scriptures places,


Words
revealing His form with a million graces.
