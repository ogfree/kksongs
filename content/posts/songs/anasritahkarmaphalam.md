TRANSLATION


1) The
Blessed Lord said: One who is unattached to the fruits of his work and who
works as he is obligated is in the renounced order of life, and he is the true
mystic: not he who lights no fire and performs no work. 


 


2)
What is called renunciation is the same as yoga, or linking oneself with the
Supreme, for no one can become a yogi unless he renounces the desire for sense
gratification. 


 


3) For
one who is a neophyte in the eightfold yoga system, work is said to be the
means; and for one who has already attained to yoga, cessation of all material
activities is said to be the means. 


 


4) A
person is said to be have attained to yoga when, having renounced all material
desires, he neither acts for sense gratification nor engages in fruitive
activities. 


 


5) A man
must elevate himself by his own mind, not degrade himself. The mind is the
friend of the conditioned soul, and his enemy as well. 


 


6) For
him who has conquered the mind, the mind is the best of friends; but for one
who has failed to do so, his very mind will be the greatest enemy. 


 


7) For
one who has conquered the mind, the Supersoul is already reached, for he has
attained tranquility. To such a man happiness and distress, heat and cold,
honor and dishonor are all the same. 


 


8) A
person is said to be established in self-realization and is called a yogi [or
mystic] when he is fully satisfied by virtue of acquired knowledge and
realization. Such a person is situated in transcendence and is self-controlled.
He sees everything--whether it be pebbles, stones or gold--as the same. 


 


9) A
person is said to be still further advanced when he regards all--the honest
well-wisher, friends and enemies, the envious, the pious, the sinner and those
who are indifferent and impartial--with an equal mind. 


 


10) A
transcendentalist should always try to concentrate his mind on the Supreme
Self; he should live alone in a secluded place and should always carefully
control his mind. He should be free from desires and feelings of
possessiveness. 


 


11-12)
To practice yoga, one should go to a secluded place and should lay kusa-grass
on the ground and then cover it with a deerskin and a soft cloth. The seat
should neither be too high nor too low and should be situated in a sacred
place. The yogi should then sit on it very firmly and should practice yoga by
controlling the mind and the senses, purifying the heart and fixing the mind on
one point. 


 


13-14)
One should hold one's body, neck and head erect in a straight line and stare
steadily at the tip of the nose. Thus, with an unagitated, subdued mind, devoid
of fear, completely free from sex life, one should meditate upon Me within the
heart and make Me the ultimate goal of life. 


 


15)
Thus practicing control of the body, mind and activities, the mystic
transcendentalist attains to the kingdom of God [or the abode of Krsna] by
cessation of material existence. 


 


16)
There is no possibility of one's becoming a yogi, O Arjuna, if one eats too
much, or eats too little, sleeps too much or does not sleep enough. 


 


17) He
who is temperate in his habits of eating, sleeping, working and recreation can
mitigate all material pains by practicing the yoga system. 


 


18)
When the yogi, by practice of yoga, disciplines his mental activities and
becomes situated in Transcendence--devoid of all material desires--he is said
to have attained yoga. 


 


19) As
a lamp in a windless place does not waver, so the transcendentalist, whose mind
is controlled, remains always steady in his meditation on the transcendent
Self. 


 


20-23)
The stage of perfection is called trance, or samadhi, when one's mind is
completely restrained from material mental activities by practice of yoga. This
is characterized by one's ability to see the self by the pure mind and to
relish and rejoice in the self. In that joyous state, one is situated in
boundless transcendental happiness and enjoys himself through transcendental
senses. Established thus, one never departs from the truth and upon gaining
this he thinks there is no greater gain. Being situated in such a position, one
is never shaken, even in the midst of greatest difficulty. This indeed is
actual freedom from all miseries arising from material contact. 


 


24)
One should engage oneself in the practice of yoga with undeviating determination
and faith. One should abandon, without exception, all material desires born of
false ego and thus control all the senses on all sides by the mind. 


 


25)
Gradually, step by step, with full conviction, one should become situated in
trance by means of intelligence, and thus the mind should be fixed on the Self
alone and should think of nothing else. 


 


26)
From whatever and wherever the mind wanders due to its flickering and unsteady
nature, one must certainly withdraw it and bring it back under the control of
the Self. 


 


27)
The yogi whose mind is fixed on Me verily attains the highest happiness. By
virtue of his identity with Brahman, he is liberated; his mind is peaceful, his
passions are quieted, and he is freed from sin. 


 


28)
Steady in the Self, being freed from all material contamination, the yogi
achieves the highest perfectional stage of happiness in touch with the Supreme
Consciousness. 


 


29) A
true yogi observes Me in all beings, and also sees every being in Me. Indeed,
the self-realized man sees Me everywhere. 


 


30)
For one who sees Me everywhere and sees everything in Me, I am never lost, nor
is he ever lost to Me. 


 


31)
The yogi who knows that I and the Supersoul within all creatures are one worships
Me and remains always in Me in all circumstances. 


 


32) He
is a perfect yogi who, by comparison to his own self, sees the true equality of
all beings, both in their happiness and distress, O Arjuna! 


 


33)
Arjuna said: O Madhusudana, the system of yoga which You have summarized
appears impractical and unendurable to me, for the mind is restless and
unsteady. 


 


34)
For the mind is restless, turbulent, obstinate and very strong, O Krsna, and to
subdue it is, it seems to me, more difficult than controlling the wind. 


 


35)
The Blessed Lord said: O mighty-armed son of Kunti, it is undoubtedly very
difficult to curb the restless mind, but it is possible by constant practice
and by detachment. 


 


36)
For one whose mind is unbridled, self-realization is difficult work. But he
whose mind is controlled and who strives by right means is assured of success.
That is My opinion. 


 


37)
Arjuna said: What is the destination of the man of faith who does not
persevere, who in the beginning takes to the process of self-realization but
who later desists due to worldly-mindedness and thus does not attain perfection
in mysticism? 


 


38) O
mighty-armed Krsna, does not such a man, being deviated from the path of Transcendence,
perish like a riven cloud, with no position in any sphere? 


 


39)
This is my doubt, O Krsna, and I ask You to dispel it completely. But for
Yourself, no one is to be found who can destroy this doubt. 


 


40)
The Blessed Lord said: Son of Prtha, a transcendentalist engaged in auspicious
activities does not meet with destruction either in this world or in the
spiritual world; one who does good, My friend, is never overcome by evil. 


 


41)
The unsuccessful yogi, after many, many years of enjoyment on the planets of
the pious living entities, is born into a family of righteous people, or into a
family of rich aristocracy. 


 


42) Or
he takes his birth in a family of transcendentalists who are surely great in
wisdom. Verily, such a birth is rare in this world. 


 


43) On
taking such a birth, he again revives the divine consciousness of his previous
life, and he tries to make further progress in order to achieve complete
success, O son of Kuru. 


 


44) By
virtue of the divine consciousness of his previous life, he automatically
becomes attracted to the yogic principles--even without seeking them. Such an
inquisitive transcendentalist, striving for yoga, stands always above the
ritualistic principles of the scriptures. 


 


45)
But when the yogi engages himself with sincere endeavor in making further
progress, being washed of all contaminations, then ultimately, after many, many
births of practice, he attains the supreme goal. 


 


46) A
yogi is greater than the ascetic, greater than the empiricist and greater than
the fruitive worker. Therefore, O Arjuna, in all circumstances, be a yogi. 


 


47)
And of all yogis, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in
transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in yoga and is
the highest of all.
