TRANSLATION


1) My dear mind, you are
certainly most vile and wicked. Your Lord is Sri 
Hari
,
the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So then why are you abandoning Him to
worship the various demigods, following the path of lust?


 


2) The Supreme Lord is one
absolute truth, above and beyond the Brahman effulgence. Therefore honor Him
only with resolute determination, and completely dedicate the whole of your
life unto Him. As far as all the innumerable demigods are concerned, their power
and authority compared to His is only partial, for they are each the absolute
controller of only one specific type of work within this material world's
administrative department.


 


3) Maintaining polite
respect for all these demigods, worship only Lord 
Hari
,
for He is the only Supreme Controller of all these other small controllers.
Incessantly pass your time, my dear mind, by arduously endeavoring for intense,
single-minded devotional service unto Him, Whose total potency of 
maya
 is simply His insignificant shadow reflection.


 


4) By pouring water on the
root of the tree, all the branches and leaves become strong and healthy. It is
useless to try to pour the water on the top part of the tree only. Similarly,
all the demigods are the dear friend of one who has actual devotion to 
Hari
. Indeed, they all show great honor and respect to the
devotee of the Lord. 


 


5) Now 
Bhaktivinoda

is telling you, dear mind, just worship always, just worship ceaselessly, just
worship eternally the divine lotus feet of 
Radha
 and 
Krsna
.
