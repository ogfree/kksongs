TRANSLATION


1)
O Rama, Who is adorned by collection of innumerable qualities! O Rama, Who is
loved by the daughter of earth (Sita)! O Rama, Whose face is pleasing like the
moon in the night! O Rama, Who was exiled in the forest by the words of His
father (due to a vow extracted by Kaikeyi)!


 


2)
O Rama, Whose arrival of His lotus feetÂ’s entrance into town (Sindhvipura) was
announced by His dear Guha! O Rama, Whose gentle feet were washed by him
(Guha)! O Rama, Who gave pleasure to sages led by Bharadvaja! O Rama, Who made
Citrakuta hill His abode in the forest!


 


3)
O Rama, Who was constantly thought of by Dasaratha! O Rama, Who was entrusted
by Bharata, the son of Kaikeyi! O Rama, Who performed His fatherÂ’s ritualistic
funeral! O Rama, Who offered his wooden slippers to Bharata.
