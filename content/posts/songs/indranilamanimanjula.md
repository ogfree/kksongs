TRANSLATION


1) All
glories to Sri Krsna, who enjoys transcendental pastimes in Vrndavana forest.
His complexion is as splendid as sapphires. He wears kadamba blossom earrings,
and his broad chest is decorated with a garland of gunja.


 


2) All
glories to Sri Krsna, who enjoys transcendental pastimes in Vrndavana forest.
He is the cakora bird that drinks the moonlight of Sri Radha's face. He steals
away the composure of all the gopis. Skillfully clapping his hands in the
rhythm known as carcari, he dances very gracefully.


 


3) All
glories to Sri Krsna, who enjoys transcendental pastimes in Vrndavana forest.
He stopped his relatives from performing the famous sacrifice. He removed
Indra's pride, and to protect the people of Vraja he playfully lifted
Govardhana hill.


 


4) All
glories to Sri Krsna, who enjoys transcendental pastimes in Vrndavana forest.
His pastimes are glorified by the parrots. By decorating his flute with many
beautiful melodies, he glorifies the festival of his transcendental amorous
love.


 


5) All
glories to Sri Krsna, who enjoys transcendental pastimes in Vrndavana forest.
The luster of his silk garments eclipses the glory of gold. The top of His head
is decorated with a peacock feather. He pleases the splendid girls of Vraja.


 


6) All
glories to Sri Krsna, who enjoys transcendental pastimes in Vrndavana forest.
He is anointed with fragrant sandal paste. His hips are decorated with a golden
belt. He is the elephant bound by the rope of the raised breasts of Sri
Radhika.


 


7) All
glories to Sri Krsna, who enjoys transcendental pastimes in Vrndavana forest.
His forehead is splendid with golden dhatu tilaka. His campaka garland moves to
and fro in his pastimes. He meets the beautiful-eyebrowed gopis in the palatial
caves of Govardhana hill.


 


8) All
glories to Sri Krsna, who enjoys transcendental pastimes in Vrndavana forest.
His dancing sidelong glances make the gopis drop all their household duties. He
is the charming lover of Vrsabhanu's daughter, who is mad with love for Him.


 


9) He
who reads these eight verses, which are beautified by the Lord's charming
pastimes in the forest, will attain many splendid transcendental virtues. He
will become attached to the service of the Lord's lotus feet.
