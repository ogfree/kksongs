TRANSLATION


1) I
worship Radha and Krsna, the youthful couple of Vraja, who are full of all
beauty, charm, and cleverness. RadhaÂ’s splendid garments eclipse the deep blue
color of a peacockÂ’s throat, and KrsnaÂ’s eclipse gold. RadhaÂ’s splendid bodily
complexion resembles the color of a golden daffodil, while KrsnaÂ’s resembles a
charming monsoon cloud.


 


2) I
worship Radha and Krsna, the youthful couple of Vraja. The abundance of Their
facesÂ’ splendor acts like a great mass of pigments, perfuming everything in all
directions. Thus it fully eclipses the loveliness of the full moon and mocks
the pride of a fresh lotus. 


 


3) I
worship Radha and Krsna, the youthful couple of Vraja, who shook off a great
abundance of red sindura powder in Their playful quarrel, who are like two
proud, splendid elephants playfully marked by KamadevaÂ’s great goad, and who
are intent on enjoying a festival of transcendental amorous pastimes in the
cottage of vines.


 


4) I
worship Radha and Krsna, the youthful couple of Vraja, who are flooded with
tears of joy flowing from Their heartsÂ’ lakes, which are filled by the swiftly
flowing mountain streams of Their intense love for each other, and who, the
hairs of Their bodies standing up with bliss, have become as splendid as
blossoming kadamba flowers.


 


5) I
worship Radha and Krsna, the youthful couple of Vraja, who, both inexpressibly
great teachers in the pastimes of amorous battle, first wound each other with
the arrows of the splendor of Their restless sidelong glances, and finally
defeat each other with sweet joking words that have no equal in the entire
world. 


 


6) I
worship Radha and Krsna, the youthful couple of Vraja, who enjoy transcendental
pastimes in the forest with Their affectionate friends, who are all expert at
very wonderful playfulness. Radha and Krsna delight the deer and doe of each
otherÂ’s hearts with rhythmic clapping very pleasing to the ear.


 


7) I
worship the youthful couple of Vraja, who, Their arms expert at graceful
rhythmic splashing, during the hot summer boisterously enjoy water pastimes in
Their favorite lake. That lake is fragrant with many freshly blossomed lotuses
that are great palaces filled with sweet flower-nectar.


 


8) I
worship the youthful couple of Vraja, who skillfully quarrel in the dice-game
while Their expert friends, taking sides, witness the game, loudly proclaim
victory for their respective sides, and forcibly take the wagered prizes.


 


9)
Those who take pleasure in reading these eight verses, which blossom with the
transcendental qualities of Radha and Krsna, the youthful couple of Vraja, will
attain the ever-fresh sweetness of pure transcendental love and reside near the
Divine CoupleÂ’s lotus feet.
