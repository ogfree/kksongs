TRANSLATION


1)
Oh my Lord 
Hari
, when will such a day be mine?
Developing love and attachment for a pure devotee, my material desires will
thereby become weakened and subdued.


 


2)
However I feel in the core of my heart, I will behave accordingly, totally free
from duplicity. Without expecting any respect, I will give all 
honor
 unto others. I will constantly remain absorbed in
ecstatic remembrance of the Lord by performing the congregational chanting of
His holy names.


 


3)
Just to pass this life I will perform only whatever minimum activity is
required to maintain this body, and I will become attached only to that which
is favorable for the worship of Lord 
Krsna
.


 


4)
I will forcibly reject whatever is unfavorable for His worship. Thus worshiping
and worshiping, the time has come that I have to give up this body.


 


5)
These are the hopes of 
Bhaktivinoda
 while living
within the 
forest
 of 
Godruma
. Hiding in secrecy, he continuously weeps with an
extremely eager heart only for the purpose of receiving the causeless mercy of
the Supreme Lord.
