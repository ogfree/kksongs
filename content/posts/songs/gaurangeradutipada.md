LYRICS:


(1)


gaurāńgera
duṭi pada, jār dhana sampada,

gaurāńgera madhura-līlā, jār karṇe
praveśilā,

hṛdoya nirmala bhelo tār

gaurāńgera nāma loy, tāra hoy premodoy,

tāre mui jāi bolihāri

gaurāńga-guṇete jhure, nitya-līlā tāre sphure,

se jana bhakati-adhikārī

gaurāńgera
sańgi-gaṇe, nitya-siddha kori' māne,

narottama māge tāra sańga


 


WORD
FOR WORD TRANSLATION: 
Gaurangera Duti Pada


 


TRANSLATION


1)
Anyone who has accepted the two lotus feet of Lord Caitanya can understand the
true essence of devotional service.  If one is captivated by the pleasing
pastimes of Lord Caitanya, the dirty things in his heart will all become
cleansed. 


 


2) One
who simply takes the holy name of Gaura-sundara, Sri Krsna Caitanya, will
immediately develop love of God.  To such a person I say: Bravo! 
Very nice!  Excellent!  If one appreciates the merciful pastimes of
Lord Caitanya and feels ecstasy and sometimes cries, this process will
immediately help him to understand the eternal pastimes of Radha-Krsna. 


 


3)
Simply by understanding that the associates of Lord Gauranga are eternally free
from material contamination, one can immediately be promoted to the
transcendental abode of Lord Krsna.  If one simply understands that the
land of Navadvipa is not different from Vrndavana, then he actually lives in
Vrndavana. 


 


4) If
one says: "Let me dive deep into the waves of the nectarean ocean of the
transcendental loving movement introduced by Lord Caitanya", he
immediately becomes one of the confidential devotees of Radha and Krsna. 
It does not matter whether one is a householder living at home or a vanaprastha
or sannyasi living in the forest, if he chants "O Gauranga, and becomes a
devotee of Lord Caitanya, then Narottama dasa begs to have his association.
