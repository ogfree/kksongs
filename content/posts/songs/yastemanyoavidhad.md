TRANSLATION


Invocation: Lord 
Hari
 is the Supreme Whole.


 


1) O 
Manyu
,
the persons who worship 
You
, who is like a
thunderbolt, the destroyer of enemies, enjoys all power and strength combined,
may we overcome our enemies with You as our friend, invigorating and strong.


 


2) 
Manyu

is 
Indra
, He is 
Varuna
 and 
Agni
. Those of human descent praise 
Manyu
.
Protect us 
Manyu
, be pleased with our austerities.


 


3) Come to us 
Manyu
, you who are the strongest of the strong. With
austerity as your companion, overthrow our enemies. Give us spiritual wealth, O
slayer of enemies, adversaries and foes.


 


4) Give us strength in
battle, 
Manyu
, O you who posses overpowering
strength. You are self-existent, furious, the 
overthrower

of enemies, the beholder of all, enduring, and vigorous.


 


5) O Lord 
Manyu
, not taking part in 
Your

worship (not offering oblations at the sacrifice) I was forced to retreat
before my enemies. I avoided and neglected 
Your
 worship.
Yet please be kind and give me strength.


 


6) I am Yours! Come to 
me,
 turn Your face towards me! O resister of the foes,
sustainer of all, 
Manyu
, the holder of a thunderbolt,
come to me. Let us slay the demons, and help 
Your

devotees.


 


7) Approach me by my right
side and let us slay a multitude of foes. I offer 
You

the best part of the Soma juice, let us drink it together in privacy.


 


REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:




Manyu
 is a form of Lord 
Nrsimha
,
the personification and presiding Deity of anger.
