TRANSLATION


1) O 
Krsna
,
You saw 
the two 
yamala-arjuna

trees, and understood the words that 
Narada
 had
mercifully spoken for the deliverance of the offensive sons of 
Kuvera
. 
you
 broke the curse which
bound 
Kuvera's
 sons to the forms of trees.


 


2) O 
Krsna
,
You are attainable only by those who are free from material beauty and other
so-called 
opulences
 can never attain 
You
. You are very dear to 
Narada
 
Muni
, and 
You
 pulled the grinding
mortar to which You were bound. All glories unto 
You
.


 


3) O 
Krsna
,
fulfilling the benediction offered by 
Devarsi
 
Narada
, You broke the 
yamala-arjuna

trees. O Lord, O controller of all controllers, the 
tw

sons of 
Kuvera
 then glorified 
You

with transcendental prayers.


 


4) O 
Krsna
,
although it is very difficult for the conditioned souls to understand 
Your
 glories, the devotees constantly engage their minds in
exclusively thinking about You and nothing else. O Lord, Your transcendental
pastimes are wonderfully extraordinary and 
You
 are the
most auspicious of all auspicious things within this universe.


 


5) O 
Krsna
,
You are greatly pleased when one becomes a servant of 
Your

servant, and You are very affectionate to those who become the devotee of Your
devotee The two sons of 
Kuvera
 thus chanted Your
glories and constantly tasted the nectar of Your devotional service with all
their limbs and senses.


 


6) O 
Krsna
,
pleased by the prayers of the sons of 
Kuvera
 (the
friend of Lord Siva), 
You
 spoke to them with words
that seemed like a shower of nectar. You explained how glorious it is even to
see a pure devotee of Your Lordship. 
and
 You granted
to 
Kuvera's
 sons the benediction of attaining pure
love fore You.
