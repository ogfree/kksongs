TRANSLATION


Refrain:
Worship Radha Krsna! Gopala Krsna! Oh Mouth! Speak the names of Â“Krsna Krsna!Â”


 


1)
Your heart will be filled and will not be lacking anything. Superior happiness
will awaken in your nature.


 


2)
Hari is the eternal friend of fallen souls, and accompanies the spirit soul
during happiness and distress. O spiritually blind people, worship Lord Hari
and bind yourself to His lotus feet, for it is difficult to escape once Maya
finds you.


 


3) O people
of foolish mentality! Worship Lord Hari, who is Your eternal companion, whose
mercy is known throughout the worlds. Lord Hari, who relishes various pastimes,
is coming to the city of Nadiya with loving heart of Srimati Radharani.
