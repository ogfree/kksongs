TRANSLATION


Chorus:
Today 
Radha
 and 
Madhava
 are
swinging in the 
kunja
.Â”


 


1)
Â“The 
sakhis
 meet and sing while the flute plays
incessantly. Meeting eyes uproot pique and pearls dangle under 
Their
 noses.Â”


 


2)
Â“The swing is made of lots of flowers and swarms of buzzing bees enjoy there.
The female Sari-parrots, the male 
Suka
 parrots and
the cuckoos fly around in the 
kunja
, surrounding them
and singing.Â”


 


3)
Â“On the swing 
Radha
 is alarmed and scolds 
Madhava
, Who laughs and holds 
Her
.
He becomes overwhelmed with bliss when He touches 
Her

and keeps Her pressed on His lap.Â”


 


4)
Â“The 
priya
 
sakhis
 pull the
ropes of the swing and 
Gori
 
Rai

becomes overwhelmed with fatigue. Dina Krsna 
dasa

sings: Absorbed in 
rasa
 
Dhani


Rai
 fell asleep.Â”

is to be sung in Raga
