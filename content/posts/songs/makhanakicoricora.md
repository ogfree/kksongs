TRANSLATION


1) 
Mother 
Yasoda

says to her son, Â“I am trying to make You understand, my child, that it is
naughty to steal butter.Â”


 


2) 
Â“
Nanda
 Baba
has nine-hundred thousand cows who give fresh butter daily. Yet, still 
You
 steal butter from Your uncleÂ’s house without feeling
ashamed.Â”


 


3) 
Â“All the village people are speaking
about 
Your
 mischievous activities. 
Nanda

Baba has such a high reputation, but now everyone is laughing at us.Â”


 


4)
Â“When the residents of 
Varsana
 meet together in the
evening,


there
 is always some fresh gossip. And now
the name of 
Radha
, the daughter of a reputable
father, is connected with 
You
.Â”


 


5) 
Surya
 
dasa
 looks on as 
Krsna
 stands
panting before 
Yasoda
 while saying, Â“I cannot stop
stealing butter, 
Maiya
! Â– what will be, will be.Â”
