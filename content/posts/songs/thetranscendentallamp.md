LYRICS:


(1)


The transcendental lamp of 
Navadvip
, 
Gaurangadev
,


He took with great endeavor
'round the world the souls to save


Who long had dwelt in
darkness, never chanting 
Krsna's
 name


The vast renown of 
Srila
 
Prabhupada
 I now proclaim.


 


(2)


The sacred treasure left by

Vyas
 and other learned saints


He rendered into English
free of speculation's taints,


And thus 
he


mercif'lly
 fulfilled Sri 
Sarasvati's

aim


The vast renown of 
Srila
 
Prabhupada
 I now proclaim.


 


(3)


The brilliant sun of Lord 
Govinda's
 form is shining bright


Throughout this world
because of his sharp logic's awesome might.


That sun makes all the 
Mayavadi
 glowworms hide in shame


The vast renown of 
Srila
 
Prabhupada
 I now proclaim.


 


(4)


The pristine Ganges of the 
Bhagavat
 flows everywhere


Because
of his great effort.
 In that
stream, the sages' prayers


Are gems, and 
Krsna's
 pastimes are swans sporting unrestrained


The vast renown of 
Srila
 
Prabhupada
 I now proclaim.


 


(5)


Ensuring that his mission's
victory would be complete,


He planted Sri 
Sri
 
Radha-Krsna's
 charming lotus
feet


In temples by the dozen and
in countless hearts unchained


The vast renown of 
Srila
 
Prabhupada
 I now proclaim.


 


(6)


The fierce and formidable
army led by wicked Kali


Is being slain by arrow
showers, volley upon volley.


Those arrows are his
all-auspicious books of spotless fame


The vast renown of 
Srila
 
Prabhupada
 I now proclaim.


 


(7)


The Hare 
Krsna
 movement's a desire tree, whose fruits


Are all the splendid ways
Lord 
Gaura's
 army wins 
recruits.


To plant that tree upon the
earth, from 
Krsna's
 realm he came


The vast renown of 
Srila
 
Prabhupada
 I now proclaim.


 


(8)


An ocean of compassion, he
has taken shelter of


Sri 
Nanda's
 Son with all his being in everlasting love.


He lives on by his words,
with him his followers remain


The vast renown of 
Srila
 
Prabhupada
 I now proclaim.


 


(9)


I pray that those who hear
this hymn, which shines the brilliant light


Of 
Srila


Prabhupada's
 renown in Kali-
yuga's

night,


Will soon attain firm faith
in his instructions so that they


May one day join him in 
Golok
, and there with 
Krsna
 stay.
