LYRICS:


haiń
āńkha vo jo śyāma kā daraśana kiyā kare


haiń
śīṣ jo prabhu carana meń vandana kiyā kare


bekāra
vo mukha hai, jo rahe vyartha bātoń meń


mukha
vo hai jo hari nāma kā sumirana kiyā kare


hīre
mote se nahīń śobhā hai hāth kī


hai
hāth jo bhagavān kā pūjan kiyā kare


marakara
bhī amara nāma hai us jīva kā jaga meń


prabhu
prema meń balidāna jo jīvan kiyā kare


 


TRANSLATION:


They
are truly eyes that behold the vision of Syama (Krsna). It is truly a head that
offers obeisances to the Lord feet in prayer. Useless is such a mouth that
speaks useless topics. It is truly a mouth that constantly remembers Lord
HariÂ’s name. Diamond and pearls do not truly ornament a hand; for it is truly a
hand offers prayers to the Lord. After death, the name of such a spirit soul
remains immortal, for continuing to live after sacrificing everything for the
love of the Lord.


 


REMARKS/EXTRA
INFORMATION:


This
song often acts as a prelude before the song 
Aisi Lagi Lagan

This
song was also featured at the end of the ISKCON produced film Â“Haridasa
Thakura.Â”
