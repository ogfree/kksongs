TRANSLATION


1)
The prostitute Pingala said, "Just see how greatly illusioned I am!
Because I cannot control my mind, just like a fool I desire lusty pleasure from
an insignificant man. [30]


 


2)
I am such a fool that I have given up the service of that person who, being
eternally situated with my heart, is actually most dear to me. That most dear
one is the Lord of the Universe, who is that bestower of real love and
happiness and the source of all prosperity. Although He is in my own heart, I
have completely neglected Him. Instead I have ignorantly served insignificant
men who can never satisfy my real desires and who have simply brought me
unhappiness, fear, anxiety, lamentation, and illusion. [31]


 


3)
Oh, how I have uselessly tortured my own soul! I have sold my body to lusty,
greedy men who are themselves objects of pity. Thus practicing the most
abominable profession of a prostitute, I hoped to get money and sex pleasure.
[32]


 


4)
This material body is like a house in which I, the soul, am living. The bones
forming my spine, ribs, arms and legs are like the beams, crossbeams and
pillars of the house, and the whole structure, which is full of stool and
urine, is covered by skin, hair and nails. The nine doors leading into this
body are constantly excreting foul substances. Besides me, what woman could be
so foolish as to devote herself to this material body, thinking that she might
find pleasure and love in this contraption? [33]


 


5)
Certainly in this city of Videha I alone am completely foolish. I neglected the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, who awards us everything, even our original
spiritual form, and instead I desired to enjoy sense gratification with many
men. [34]


 


6)
The Supreme Personality of Godhead is absolutely the dearest one for all living
beings because He is everyone's well-wisher and Lord. He is the Supreme Soul
situated in everyone's heart. Therefore I will now pay the price of complete
surrender, and thus purchasing the Lord I will enjoy with Him just like
Laksmidevi. [35]


 


7)
Men provide sense gratification for women, but all these men, and even the
demigods in heaven, have a beginning and an end. They are all temporary
creations who will be dragged away by time. Therefore how much actual pleasure
or happiness could any of them ever give to their wives? [36]


 


8)
Although I most stubbornly hoped to enjoy the world, somehow or other
detachment has arisen in my heart and it is making me very happy. Therefore,
the Supreme Lord, Vishnu, must be pleased with me. Without knowing it, I must
have performed some activity satisfying to Him. [37]


 


9)
A person who has developed detachment can give up the bondage of material
society, friendship, and love, and a person who undergoes great suffering
gradually becomes, out of hopelessness, detached and indifferent to the
material world. Thus, due to my great suffering, such detachment awoke in my
heart. Therefore, I am in fact fortunate and have received the mercy of the
Lord. He must somehow or other be pleased with me. [38]


 


10)
With devotion I accept the great benefit that the Lord has bestowed upon me. Having
given up my sinful desires for ordinary sense gratification, I now take shelter
of Him, the Supreme Lord. [39]


 


11)
I am now completely satisfied and I have full faith in the Lord's mercy.
Therefore I will maintain myself with whatever comes of its own accord. I shall
enjoy life with only the Lord, He who is the real source of love and
happiness." [40]
