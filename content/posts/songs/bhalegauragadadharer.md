TRANSLATION


1) As
I behold the wondrous arati of my Lords Gaura and Gadadhara, I enter into the
mood of Their existence previous to appearing in Nadiya (Their Vrndavana lila
as Sri Sri Radha and Krsna). It is simply indescribable.


 


2)
Underneath a desire-tree, seated upon a jeweled throne, the ever-youthful
couple named Kisora and Kisori are surrounded by all of Their gopi friends.


Â 


3) Sri
Radhika and Lord Govindaji are decorated with many shining jewels and pearls
inlaid with gold artwork, enhancing the sparkling splendor of each and every
limb of Their transcendental forms.


 


4) The
meeting of Their two bodily forms has generated a luster that brightens all the
worlds, and may be compared to a garland of lightning (Radha) fixed upon a dark
blue raincloud (Krsna).


 


5) On
the occasion of Their meeting there is a concert produced by the sounding of
conchshells, bells, karatalas and mrdangas. Such kirtana is supremely sweet and
relishable to hear.


 


6) The
cowherd damsels of Vrndavana led by Visakha Devi sing the glories of the Divine
Couple while the priya-narma-sakhis cool Their Lordships by waving camara fans.


 


7)
Ananga Manjari offers Them sandalwood pulp scented with cuwa while Rupa Manjari
places a garland of jasmine flowers about Their necks.


 


8) The
beautiful Lalita Sundari holds a lamp of five flames scented with camphor and
waves it aloft, offering arati to the Divine Couple.



9) Parvati, Laksmi, and the personified Vedas cry in great happiness while
rolling on the ground and singing of the fortunate position of the damsels of
Vraja-bhumi.


 


10)
Bhaktivinoda resides at Surabhi Kunja in the land of Godruma-dwipa, relishing
the joy of divine love at the sight of this beautiful arati.
