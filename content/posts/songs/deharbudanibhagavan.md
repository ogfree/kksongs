TRANSLATION


1) O
Bhagavan, please be merciful and grant me millions of bodies. Then give each of
those bodies millions of mouths and each of those mouths millions of tongues. O
Natha, and on each of those tongues may Your millions of divine attributes
dance eternally.


 


2)
What is the use of a soul that does not have millions of bodies? What is the
use of a body which does not have millions of mouths, and what is the use of a
mouth which does not possess millions of tongues? And what is the use of a
tongue on which Your millions of names donÂ’t dance?


 


3) O
Natha, may my soul perpetually possess hundreds of bodies, may each body
possess thousands of mouths, and may each mouth have hundreds of thousands of
tongues upon which Your millions of names will dance. 


 


4) O
Madhava, my special supplication is that I be present before Your deity form or
anywhere else, with thousands of ears with which to perpetually drink the
nectar of Your devoteesÂ’ kirtana of Your nama, rupa, guna and lila.


 


5) O
Bhagavan, and as I drink such nectar with millions of ears, may I have millions
of tongues with which to incessantly extol the nama, rupa, guna and lila which
I hear in this way I will remain forever immersed in divine bliss.


 


6) May
each of my millions of ears be accompanied by millions of eyes, may each of
those eyes be accompanied by millions of hearts, and may those millions of
hearts be accompanied by millions of tongues. Then those millions of ears will
perpetually hear the glories of the ocean of Your beauty, those millions of
eyes will perpetually receive darsana of that beauty, those millions of hearts
will perpetually embrace it, and those billions of tongues will incessantly
drink its nectar.


 


7) May
I have millions of eyes to drink the nectar of Your beauty, millions of ears to
hear Your very sweet voice, millions of noses to smell Your fragrance, millions
of tongues to taste Your sweetness, and millions of hearts with which to obtain
the nectar of Your embrace.


 


8) May
I have millions of feet to employ in going to Your side, millions of hands with
which to attend You, and millions of times intelligence to learn how to serve
You. O Bhagavan, please be merciful and grant me these benedictions.
