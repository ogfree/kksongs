TRANSLATION


1)
Oh my Lord 
Hari
! Your twin lotus feet are full of
mighty prowess in performing transcendental pastimes, which are constantly
expanding daily throughout both the material and spiritual worlds. Such
pastimes are eternally being performed just to mitigate all the sufferings of 
Your
 devotees. For this reason only are 
Your

eightfold pastimes enacted.


 


2)
Despite the presence of 
Your
 pastimes here, which are
the real treasure of this universe, I am still bereft of all good fortune, for
I have cheated myself out of worshiping Your lotus feet in devotional service.
Thus I am most fallen, and there is no one else quite as fallen as me. What
other activities could possibly be more sinful than those which were performed
by me throughout my entire lifetime?


 


3)
Now 
Bhaktivinoda
, with the utmost humility says to 
You
, oh Lord... without Your causeless mercy, I have no
other refuge. Alas! When will I get 
Your
 kind favor? I
will stand up and forcefully run for 
You
, and then I
will behold Your beautiful lotus feet with my very eyes.
