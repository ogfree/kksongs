TRANSLATION


1)
The heart of one who is a receptacle for 
rasa
 is just
like a holding tank which is filled with this liquid mellow. The specific
symptoms of such a 
rasa
 laden heart is that it
fosters the gradual manifestation of ecstatic emotion, which evolves gradually
from the beginning as 
sraddha
 (faith), then 
nistha
 (steadiness), then 
ruci

(taste), then finally 
bhava
 (firm attachment to
Krsna). This is the definition of what is known as 
rati
,
or affection within the scope of the transcendental loving mellow.


 


2)
The constantly flowing undercurrent and cause of all mellows is called "
stayi-bhava
" or basic permanent ecstasy. It is the
primary root origin of all mellows, and it eternally exists in great beauty and
splendor. As the fountainhead of 
rasa
, it fuses all
subordinate mellows and subjugates them all under its own control. Thus, it
exhibits the topmost manifestation of its own supreme power, which contains all
inconceivable, simultaneously favorable and opposing ecstasies.


 


3)
In considering the differences in the various ecstatic loving moods of this
permanent ecstasy (
sthayi
 
bhava
),
we see that there are two divisions of subjects which fall into: 1) five direct
or primary mellows, and 2) seven indirect or secondary mellows. The five
principle types of affection are called 
santa
, 
dasya
, 
sakhya
, 
vatsalya
 and 
madhura
, or
neutrality, servitude, friendship, parental affection and conjugal love,
respectively.


 


4)
The seven indirect affections are known as: 1) 
hasya

(devotional laughing attachment), 2) 
adbhuta

(devotional attachment fixed in wonder and astonishment), 3) 
vira
 (chivalrous attachment with charitable and merciful
tendencies), 4) 
karuna
 (attachment in compassion with
lamentation), 5) 
raudra
 (devotion mixed with anger),
6) 
bhayanaka
 (devotion mixed with fear), and 7) 
bibhatsa
 (attachment enjoyed by the devotee which develops
in an abominable way). All of these mellows are found in great abundance within
the realm of devotional service to Krsna, and all these different types of
attachments exist eternally as beautiful decorations of the all-consistent 
sthayi
 
bhava
.
