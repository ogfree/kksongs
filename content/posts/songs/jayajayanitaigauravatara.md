TRANSLATION


Refrain:
Glory 
glory
 to Lord 
Gaura

and Lord 
Nitai
 who descended to this world! Kindly
picking up the drowning souls They placed them in the strong boat of Lord 
KrsnaÂ’s
 holy names and delivered them. 


 


1)
The ocean of repeated birth and death is horrible and wide. The people of the
world were drowning in it. The fallen souls were distraught. No one could swim
to the shore.


 


2)
Even Brahma, Siva, 
Vyasa
, 
Sukadeva
,

Narada
, and all the demigods and sages could not find
that ocean's shore. To the fallen people, Lord 
Gaura

and Lord 
Nitai
 gave the gift of ecstatic spiritual
love. Who has limitless mercy like Them?


 


3)
Will there ever be another 
avatara
 like Them? They
were surrounded by a host of 
rasika
 devotees.
Remembering Them, poor 
Ghanasyama
 is overcome. He
feels as if a javelin is pushed into his heart.
