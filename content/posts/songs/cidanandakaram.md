TRANSLATION


1) His form is full of spiritual bliss. He is the sweet essence of the
Vedas. He is sweet like nectar. He is supremely independent. He is the abode
where everything rests. He carries the devotees to the farther shore of the
ocean of birth and death. He is supremely virtuous. He is Goddess Laksmi's
necklace. He enjoys pastimes in Vraja's forests. Siva praises His glories. O
people, please always worship Lord Govinda, the root of all bliss.


 


2) He resides on the great ocean. He is the father of all moving and
unmoving beings. He protects the demigods in the higher worlds. He is a flood of
nectar. He rides on Garuda. He is pleased by devotion. He knows every heart. He
knows everything. He is the sages' shelter. To Dhruva He gave an eternal abode.
O people, please always worship Lord Govinda, the root of all bliss.


 


3) Fixing their intelligence on Him, the sages meditate on Him. Filling
the cups of their ears, the ascetics drink the nectar of His glories. He is
known by the great statements of the Vedas. He created the three worlds. He is
the supreme ordainer of what shall be. The material mind has no power to
measure Him. In a moment He manifests His youthful form in His devotee's heart.
O people, please always worship Lord Govinda, the root of all bliss.


 


4) By His command Goddess Maha-maya weaves her net. He wears a splendid
forest-flower-garland. He removes all sins. His forehead is graceful. He is a
cowherd boy. He killed Sisupala. His face is like the moon. He is beyond time's
touch. He is time itself. His motions are like a graceful swan. He is Mura's
enemy. O people, please always worship Lord Govinda, the root of all bliss.


 


5) He is glorious like a full moon shining in the sky. His glories are
sung by the Vedas. He is equal to all. He is pleased with the demigods. He is
not pleased by the demons. He resides in Dvaraka-puri. He is beyond the pathway
of material words. He relishes fresh butter. He is everyone's guide. O people,
please always worship Lord Govinda, the root of all bliss.


 


6) He is the supreme controller. He is Goddess Laksmi's master. He is
the master of Siva and Brahma. He brings auspiciousness. He is the brahmanas'
master. He is the demigods' master. His hair is fine and curly. He stops
strife. He is Garuda's master. He is the master of the universes. He is the
master of all the worlds. He maintains the universes. O people, please always
worship Lord Govinda, the root of all bliss.


 


7) He is Goddess Laksmi's beloved. He is handsome. He ends all fear of
this world of birth and death. He is the only friend in this world. He puts an
end to all sinful desires. He is supremely peaceful. He resides in every heart.
He protects the worlds. He ends all debate. He is self-controlled. He brings
the demons to their end. His actions are glorious. O people, please always
worship Lord Govinda, the root of all bliss.


 


8) He is supreme in all the worlds. He is the greatest. He is Indra's
younger brother, Upendra. He is the master of all yajnas. He is the most
powerful. He is the best. He is the most exalted in the three worlds. He is the
granter opf benedictions. He is independent. He is religious. He is the best of
all gurus. He is the supreme master. O people, please always worship Lord
Govinda, the root of all bliss.
