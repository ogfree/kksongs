TRANSLATION


1) O 
Krsna
, You are very fond of the city of 
Mathura
, the capitol of King 
Surasena
,
and because 
You
 decided to descend in that place to
the earth, You caused the wedding celebration of 
Devaki

and 
Vasudeva
.


 


2) O 
Krsna
, agitated by a voice from the sky,

Kamsa
, who was holding the reigns of the chariot
tried to wickedly (kill 
Devaki
). 
Devaki's

life was saved by the careful reasoned words of 
Vasudeva
.


 


3) O 
Krsna
, fulfilling his promise, the
truthful 
Vasudeva
 brought each of His sons before 
Kamsa
. O Lord, because of Your desire, 
Kamsa

was able to hear the words spoken by 
Narada
 (from the
sky). O 
Krsna
, please protect me.


 


4) O 
Krsna
, 
Kamsa

then imprisoned 
Vasudeva
 and other relatives and
bound them in chains. He killed the 
siÃ¸
 sons of 
Devaki
, thinking them to be his enemies.
