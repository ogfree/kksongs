TRANSLATION


1) Sri
Vyasadeva has explained the eternal truth while describing the pastimes of
Vraja. This eternal truth is beyond the realm of material knowledge.


 


2)
This supreme truth shines in the living entity's pure existence. This pure
existence is attainable by conditioned souls through pure absolute samadhi,
which vanquishes all impediments. There are two types of samadhiÂ—artificial and
absolute. The devotees accept natural samadhi as absolute and fabricated
samadhi as artificial, regardless of whatever explanations the jnanis have. The
soul is spiritual, therefore the qualities of self-knowledge and knowledge of
other objects are naturally present in him. By the quality of self-knowledge,
one can realize one's self. By the quality of knowing other objects, one can
realize all other objects. Since such qualities are the constitutional nature
of a living entity, where is the doubt that natural samadhi is absolute? A
living entity does not require to take shelter of another instrument to
understand the supreme object. Therefore this samadhi is faultless. But when
one takes shelter of Sankhya-samadhi, which entails faulty or unnatural
activities, it is known as artificial samadhi. The constitutional activities of
the soul are called natural samadhi, for the mind has no jurisdiction in these
activities. Natural samadhi is easy and free from misery. If one takes shelter
of this samadhi, then the eternal truth is easily realized.


 


3) The
pastimes of Vraja have been perceived and described through the process of natural
samadhi, in the form of self-realization. Although the names, forms, qualities,
and activities that are used to describe Vraja-lila appear almost mundane, that
is only because the material world created by Maya is similar to its origin,
Vaikuntha. Actually the soul's natural samadhi is a function of the spiritual
potency. Whatever is perceived through natural samadhi is the ideal example for
the material world, not imitation.


 


4) For
this reason Krsna's names, qualities, and forms have a similarity to material
names, qualities, and forms.


 


5)
Self-realization comes through self-illumination. Learned scholars call
self-realization samadhi. This is very subtle. If there is a tinge of doubt, it
is practically lost. Many truths such as the living entity's faith in his own
existence, the living entity's eternal existence, and the living entity's
relationship with the Absolute Truth are realized through natural samadhi. Â“Do
I exist or not?Â” Â“Will I exist after death?Â” Â“Do I have any relationship with
the Absolute Truth?Â” If one develops such argumentative doubts on the truth,
then his natural samadhi becomes contaminated with prejudices and gradually
forgotten. The truth can never be lost; it can only be forgotten. The soul's
eternality and the existence of the Absolute Truth cannot be established by
argument, because argument has no entrance into the realm beyond the material
world. Self-realization is the only way to establish these truths. The devotees
of Krsna always realize their eternal home, Vaikuntha, and their eternal
occupation, service to Krsna, through natural samadhi, or self-realization.
When a spirit soul practices natural samadhi, he progressively realizes the
following subjects: (1) his self, (2) the insignificance of the self, (3) the
supreme shelter, (4) the relationship between the shelter and the sheltered,
(5) the beauty of the qualities, activities, and form of the shelter, (6) the
relationships amongst the sheltered, (7) the abode of the shelter and the
sheltered, (8) the absolute time factor, (9) the various moods of the
sheltered, (10) the eternal pastimes between the shelter and the sheltered,
(11) the energies of the shelter, (12) the advancement and degradation of the
sheltered by the energies of the shelter, (13) the misidentification of the
degraded sheltered, (14) the cultivation of devotional service for restoration
of the degraded sheltered, and (15) the degraded sheltered regaining their
constitutional position through devotional service. These fifteen along with
other inconceivable truths are realized. The more material knowledge is mixed
with one's natural samadhi, the less one can realize the truth. The more one is
able to advance on the path of natural samadhi by controlling argument, which
is like the minister of material knowledge, the more one can open the
storehouse and acquire indescribable spiritual truths. The storehouse of
Vaikuntha is always full. Lord Sri Krsnacandra, the lovable object of all,
constantly invites the living entities through the open door of that storehouse.


 


6) We
have destroyed the doubts that hinder samadhi, and we are seeing within the
inner circle of Vaikuntha the beautiful form of Sri Krsna, who is the topmost
personality of Vrndavana. If our samadhi would have been polluted with material
knowledge and if the propensity for argument, after giving up mundane
knowledge, would have intruded in the process of samadhi, then we would not
have accepted the quality of variegated nature of the spiritual world and we
would have proceeded only up to impersonal Brahman. But if material knowledge
and argument was to some extent subdued and intruded only to some extent into
the process of samadhi, then we would have accepted the eternal differentiation
between the soul and the Supersoul, and nothing more. But since we have totally
submerged this wicked propensity of doubting, we have attained complete
realization of the beautiful form of the supreme shelter.


 


7) Now
we are going to explain the form and beauty of the Lord, which are realized
through samadhi. The beautiful form of the Lord, which nourishes all spiritual
subjects, is like a human form. There is no difference between the energy and
its effect in the absolute realm, nevertheless the sandhini aspect of the
spiritual potency with the help of variegated nature arranges the effect so
perfectly that it has created a wonderfully unprecedented scene. There is no
comparison to that beauty, either in this world or in the spiritual world.
Since there is no predominance of time and space in the Absolute Truth, the significance
or greatness of the Lord's form does not increase His glories, rather, because
His form is beyond the material realm, it is always wonderful and complete.
Therefore we are seeing the body of the Lord, which is the source of all
beauty, through samadhi. The Lord's form is even more sweet. The more deeply
one sees the form of the Lord through the eyes of samadhi, the more one sees an
indescribable pleasing blackish form. Perhaps that spiritual form is
pervertedly reflected as mundane blue sapphires, which give relief to the
mundane eyes, or mundane new clouds, which increase the happiness of the
burning mundane eyes.


 


8 Â– 9)
The sandhini, samvit, and hladini potencies wonderfully merge in the beautiful threefold-bending
form of the Lord. The Lord's ever-pleasing eyes increase the beauty of His
form. Perhaps the lotus flowers of this world are modeled after His eyes. The
crown of the Lord's head is wonderfully decorated. Perhaps the peacock feathers
of this world are modeled after those decorations. A garland of spiritual
flowers increases the beauty of the Lord's neck. Perhaps a forest flower
garland of this world is modeled after that transcendental garland. Spiritual
knowledge, which is manifested from the samvit aspect of the spiritual potency,
covers the waist of the Lord's form. Perhaps the lightning bolt of a new cloud
of this world is modeled after that covering. Spiritual jewels like Kaustubha
and other ornaments beautifully decorate His form. The instrument by which the
Lord sweetly invites or spiritually attracts all is known as the flute. The
flute of this world, which creates various ragas, or musical modes, might be
modeled after that flute. This inconceivable form of the Lord is seen under the
kadamba tree, which is the form of hairs standing on end in ecstasy, on the
bank of the Yamuna, which is the form of spiritual liquid.


 


10)
Sri Krsna, the son of Nanda and Lord of the spiritual and material worlds, is
seen with the above-mentioned spiritual symptoms by the Vaisnavas through
samadhi. A swanlike person should not disregard these spiritual features
because they have shadow forms in this material world. All these spiritual
features combine to further enhance the splendor of the Lord. One will see more
subtle features of the Lord by entering deeper into samadhi, and one will see
less variety and qualities of the Lord by entering shallower into samadhi.
Unfortunate people who are enamoured by material knowledge are unable to see
the spiritual form of the Lord and the variegated nature of the spiritual world
even though they attempt to see Vaikuntha through samadhi. For this reason
their spiritual cultivation is limited and their treasure of love is very
meagre.


 


11)
Lord Sri Krsnacandra, who is realized through samadhi, kidnaps the hearts of
the gopis and maddens the spiritual and material worlds with the sound of His
flute, which is the form of all attraction.


 


12)
How can those whose hearts have been polluted by social prestige attain Krsna?
The wicked pride of this material world has six causesÂ—birth, beauty,
qualities, knowledge, opulence, and strength. People who are overwhelmed by
these six kinds of pride cannot take to the devotional service of the Lord. We
are experiencing this everyday in our life. Persons who are polluted by the
pride of knowledge consider the science of Krsna very insignificant. While
considering the goal of life, such people regard the happiness of Brahman to be
superior to the happiness of devotional service. Persons who are devoid of
pride attain the mood of gopas or gopis to enjoy with Krsna. The gopas and
gopis are the authorities in the science of Krsna. The reason for using the
word gopi in this verse is that in this book we are discussing the topmost rasa
of conjugal love. Persons who are situated in shanta, dasya, sakhya, and
vatsalya rasas are also in the mood of Vraja, and they realize the
transcendental mellows in relationship with Krsna according to their respective
moods. We are not going to elaborate on them in this book. Actually all living
entities are eligible for the mood of Vraja. When one's heart is filled with
the mood of madhurya, he attains Vraja in full perfection. Out of the five
rasas, a person is naturally attracted to the rasa in which he has an eternal
constitutional relationship with the Lord, and he should therefore worship the
Lord in that particular mood. But in this book we have only described the
living entity's topmost mood of conjugal love.


 


13)
Those who have attained the mood of the gopis are called perfected beings, and
those who imitate them are called practitioners. Therefore the learned, who
know the Absolute Truth, accept two types of sadhusÂ—perfected beings and
practitioners.


 


14) We
are now explaining the gradual process of sadhana for those in the mood of the
gopis. When the sound of Krsna's flute enters the ear of a living entity who is
wandering throughout the material world, he is attracted by the sweet sound and
becomes highly qualified.


 


15)
Sense gratification is the materialist's primary anartha. When the sheltered
give up the shelter, then they consider themselves the enjoyer of maya. If the
practitioner's propensity for enjoyment is quickly destroyed, then he can again
attain the shelter of those persons who are attached to conjugal rasa and
consider himself a transcendental woman, to be enjoyed by the Lord. Gradually
such persons develop purva-raga to such a degree that they become almost mad.


 


16) By
seeing pictures of Krsna or by repeatedly hearing descriptions of Krsna from
persons who have seen Him, one's greed for attaining Krsna increases
unlimitedly.


 


17)
When a living entity through natural knowledge experiences attraction for the
Lord, this is known as hearing songs of Krsna. Realizing Krsna after
scrutinizingly studying descriptions of His form narrated in the scriptures by
persons who have seen Krsna is called hearing the qualities of Krsna. Seeing
Krsna's artistry within the world is called seeing Krsna's picture. This
material world is the reflected shadow of spiritual variegated nature. Whoever
has realized this is said to have seen Krsna's picture. In other words, a
person becomes a Vaisnava by three processesÂ—seeing the Lord through natural
knowledge, realizing the Lord by studying the scriptures, and seeing the Lord
through His artistry.


 


18)
Pure faith in Krsna, who is the shelter of the moods of Vraja, is called
purva-raga or prag-bhava. When this faith awakens, one achieves the association
of a devotee resident of Vraja. Association of the devotees is the cause for
achieving Krsna.


 


19)
Such fortunate persons fix a love rendezvous with Krsna and then gradually
proceed towards the bank of the spiritual liquid Yamuna, where they meet their
beloved.


 


20) By
the association of Krsna, they then naturally experience such transcendental
happiness that the happiness of Brahman is considered insignificant before it.
At that time the happiness of material family life becomes comparable to the
water in the hoofprint of a calf before the ocean of love.


 


21)
Thereafter, the Lord and soul of all souls, in His ever-fresh form, unlimitedly
increases that ocean of bliss. The Lord, who is the shelter of all rasas,
always appears wonderfully ever-fresh. In other words, the sheltered persons'
thirst for rasa increases and is never quenched. Through samadhi, great
devotees have seen in the spiritual world five direct rasas, beginning with
shanta, and seven indirect rasas, beginning with heroism and compassion. Since
the material world is known as the reflected shadow of the Vaikuntha world, all
the imitation rasas of the material world must certainly be present in their
pure forms in Vaikuntha.


 


22)
Now we will again deeply discuss the previously explained science of rati,
attraction. Attraction is the seed of love and the principle asset for
executing devotional service. The self-illuminated perfect attachment of a
living entity for the sat-cid-ananda Lord is called attraction. The naturally
perfect propensity of attachment between spiritual identities is very strong
between Krsna and the living entities. This stage is called sthayi-bhava,
permanent ecstatic moods, which is the goal of the Srimad Bhagavatam, the
ornamental literature of the paramahamsas.


 


23)
This attraction is the subtle origin of rasa. Just as Â“oneÂ” is the origin in
the process of counting numbers yet it remains present in subsequent numbers,
similarly in the mature stages of pritiÂ—such as prema, sneha, mana, and
ragaÂ—attraction remains present as the origin. Attraction is seen as the root
in all the activities of priti, while bhava and various ingredients are seen as
branches and subbranches. Therefore attraction continually increases under the
shelter of rasa. There are twelve direct and indirect rasas.


 


24)
Shanta, dasya, sakhya, vatsalya, and madhurya are the five direct rasas.
Besides the five direct mellows, there are seven indirect mellows, known as
hasya (laughter), adbhuta (wonder), vira (chivalry), karuna (compassion),
raudra (anger), bibhatsa (disaster), and bhaya (fear). These seven indirect
rasas arise from the five direct rasas. Until attraction mixes with a
particular relationship, it remains in a neutral state and cannot act. But when
attraction joins with a particular relationship, it begins to manifest. The
emotions that are produced by this manifestation are the indirect rasas.


 


25)
When rati, attraction, takes the shape of rasa, it becomes more luminous by
mixing with four other ingredients. Although attraction is present under the
shelter of rasa, it cannot manifest without the ingredients. These ingredients
are of four typesÂ—vibhava (special ecstasy), anubhava (subordinate ecstasy),
sattvika (natural ecstasy), and vyabhicari (transitory ecstasy). Vibhava is
divided into the two categories alambana (the support) and uddipana
(stimulation). Alambana may be further divided into twoÂ—Krsna and His devotees.
The qualities and characteristics of Krsna and His devotees are called
uddipana. Anubhava is divided into threeÂ—alankara (ornaments of emotional
love), udbhasvara (external manifestations of emotional love), and vacika
(verbal manifestations of emotional love). The twenty types of alankaras, such
as bhava (ecstasy) and hava (gestures), are categorized into threeÂ—angaja (in
relation to the body), ayatnaja (in relation to the self), and svabhavaja (in
relation to nature). Physical activities like jrimbha (yawning), nritya
(dancing), and lunthana (plundering) are known as udbhasvaras (external
manifestations of emotional love). There are twelve vacika anubhavas, such as
alapa and vilapa. There are eight sattvika-vikaras, such as stambha (being
stunned), and sveda (perspiring). And there are thirty-three vyabhicari-bhavas,
such as nirveda (indifference). Attraction requires the constant support of
rasa and these ingredients to nourish one's relationship up to mahabhava.


 


26)
This attraction for Krsna is also known as sthayi-bhava and bhakti-rasa. Due to
the conditioned souls' relationship with the material world, their attraction
takes the shape of devotional service. In the liberated souls in Vaikuntha,
attraction is eternally present in the form of priti, or love.


 


27)
The gradual stages of the development of attraction up to mahabhava, the
manifestation of attraction under the shelter of direct and indirect rasa, and
the unlimited ocean of sweetness created by the wonderful mixture of attraction
with the above-mentioned ingredients are the eternal wealth of liberated souls
and the goal for conditioned souls. You may ask what is the need for practicing
devotional service if this spiritual blissful rasa is eternal. The answer is
that the attraction of the living entities has become perverted and mundane.
Therefore one has to awaken pure attraction in one's heart by practicing
devotional service.


 


28)
Learned personalities like Vyasadeva and we ourselves have seen through samadhi
that the science of attraction is most relishable for the pure living entities.
The qualities of the origin are somewhat reflected in its shadow. That is why
the loving affairs of this material world are the most pleasing form of
material enjoyment. But the attraction between male and female of this world is
very insignificant and abominable when compared to spiritual attraction. 


 


29) We
have thus described activities up to the rasa dance and moods up to mahabhava
enjoyed between the Supreme Lord Krsna and the eternally liberated living
entities.


 


30)
Due to associating with matter, this is the limit that our words can describe.
Whatever is beyond this can be known only through Samadhi.
