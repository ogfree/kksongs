TRANSLATION


1)

Aho
! In the hope of finding happiness, I labored hard
to build a house, but fire came and it was burned up. I swam in the ocean of
nectar, but that nectar turned out to be poison.


 


2)
O my dear friend, how unfortunate I am! Knowing that moonbeams are very
cooling, I went to take shelter of the moon to cool off my burning body, but
those rays turned into hot sunrays which scorched me instead. 


 


3)
Knowing the height of a mountain, I climbed to the peak and then fell into the
deep ocean. I want money but I am always surrounded by poverty. A very valuable
touch-stone came in my hand but at once I lost it.


 


4)
I built a city on the shore of the ocean and made a dam to move the ocean in
the hope of finding gemstones on the ocean bed, but due to the fault of my own
ill fortune, the gemstones also hid themselves.


 


5)
When I was thirsty, I took shelter of a cloud (but rain did not come). Instead,
a thunder-bolt struck my head. The poet Sri 
Candidasa

laments, Â“That I have no affection for the lotus feet of Sri 
Syamasundara
 is the only sorrow in my heart. (My love for 
Syama
 is like a trident piercing my heart.)Â”
