TRANSLATION


1)
Some of the typical services rendered by the 
sakhis

are: 1) singing songs together about the glories of 
Radha
-
Krsna, 2) performing activities which increase Their attachment for one
another, 3) executing the successful performance of Their secret rendezvous, 4)
offering different 
sakhis
 to 
Krsna

for His pleasure, 5) pleasing Them by allowing Them to taste the soft, joking
speech and comments of the 
sakhis
, and 6) decorating
Their bodies with different types of fascinating ornaments, flowers, and cloth,
all expertly arranged.


 


2)
7) The 
sakhis
 sometimes have to seek out and discover
the particular ecstatic emotion which is hidden within the deepest core of
Their hearts, 8) they have to hide the faults of 
Radha

or 
Krsna
 at times, 9) and sometimes they have to
cheat persons who are opposed to Their meeting. 10) Then, understanding the
situation of 
Their
 deep-rooted, innermost feelings,
they give expert advice which 11) causes Them to unite happily. 12) During the whole
time they render numerous other services spontaneously, such as fanning 
Them
 gently with jeweled peacock-tail fans and yak-tail
whisks.


 


3)
13) Keeping in mind the benefit of Them Both, the 
sakhis

sometimes have to chastise Them for some fault, 14) they are highly skilled in
remembering the momentary moods and inner desires of 
Radharani

when they convey messages between 
Radha
 and 
Krsna
 ( in Their presence or at other times when They are
separated), 15) they are most expert in maintaining 
Radharani's

life during the performance of Their pastimes, in accordance with the specific
changes of Her emotional ecstasies which continuously move this way and that.
These are all some of the typical services rendered during a day in the life of

Srimati
 
Radharani's
 girlfriends,


 


4)
Each 
sakhi
 is fixed up in her own specific eternal
service, which she engages in befittingly at the proper time and place. Whoever
wants to do the 
bhajana
 which strictly follows 
Srila
 
Rupa
 
Gosvami

dwells upon one particular 
sakhi
 and her 
seva
 and thus becomes her 
follower.


 


REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:


Sixteen
services are usually listed by 
Srila
 
Rupa
 
Gosvami
. The final one, not
mentioned here, is 
sarva-visaye
 
prayatna

--- special care and attention in all matteers.
