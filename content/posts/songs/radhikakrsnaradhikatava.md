TRANSLATION


(Refrain)
Oh 
Radhika
! O Krsna! O 
Radhika
!
There is separation without You, O 
Kesava
!


 


1)
Hey 
Kesava
! In Your separation 
Radha

has become very weak at 
heart,
 even the fine necklace
that She wears feels burdensome.


 


2)
Hey 
Kesava
! In Your separation 
Radhika

considers the 
candan
 paste used to cool 
Her
 bodily fever to be just like poison.


 


3)
Hey 
Kesava
! In Your separation 
Radhika

has lost all calm nature. 
She
 breaths heavily as
though CupidÂ’s arrow was blazing within Her heart.


 


4)
Â  
Hey 
Kesava
! In Your
separation 
Radhika
 appears as if a lucked lotus
flower drenched in water. While crying pathetically 
She

searches after You in every direction.


 


5)
Â  
Hey 
Kesava
! In Your
separation 
RadhikaÂ’s
 soft bed of leaf blossoms
appears just like a bed of fire!


 


6)
Â  
Hey 
Kesava
! In Your
separation 
Radhika
 stares at the ground with 
Her
 hand placed over Her cheek. Thus 
Her

pale face looks like the motionless half-moon at sunset.


 


7)
Â  
Hey 
Kesava
! In Your
separation 
Radhika
 will soon die. So to attain 
You
 in Her next life She feelingly cries: O 
Hari
! O 
Hari
! Hare Krsna!


 


8)
Â  
Let Sri 
JayadevaÂ’s

song of 
RadhikaÂ’s
 separation for 
Kesava

increase the bliss of those surrendered unto His lotus feet.
