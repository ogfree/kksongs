TRANSLATION


1) 
Radha
,
now 
You
 may enjoy in the waters of Your own lake!
Violently splash the defeated 
Krsna
!


 


2) Look! In fear He has
hidden the splendid crown of flower blossoms in His thick, black hair!


 


3) The mineral-color
pictures drawn on His body have dissolved in the water. His garland has
withered and the bees have left it.


 


4) He places His eternal,
ferociously splendid 
Kaustubha
 jewel against 
Your
 cheek, pretending that You are its reflection.
