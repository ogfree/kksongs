TRANSLATION


1)
When will 
Lalita
 
Sundari
 foster
me as her own aspirant novice maidservant? Then later she will offer me up unto
the lotus feet of 
Srimati
 
Radharani
,
and will place me entirely at 
Her
 disposal for
rendering various services according to Her own merciful orders.


 


2)
When will Sri 
Rupa
 
Manjari

take me along with herself to the banks of Sri 
Radha-kunda

to give me lessons in the performance of services to the transcendental
mellows? She will take me there and make me practice by following her
instructions and movements. Thus I will pass my time feeling great delight
within my heart.


 


3)
At the lotus feet of Sri 
Visakha
 I will learn music
and songs which are all abounding in the transcendental mellows of 
Krsna's
 pastimes. All of the other 
sakhis

in our group, including Sri 
Rati
 
Manjari

and Sri Rasa 
Manjari
, will also share their most kind
and affectionate dealings with me.


 


4)
All of us will meet together, feeling the greatest supreme bliss, and we will
remain by the lotus feet of Sri 
Radhika
. When, oh
when will there be this highest excellence of the culmination of spiritual
perfection, whereby I will receive the intoxicating honey flowing from the
lotus feet of 
Srimati
 
Radharani
?
