TRANSLATION


1)
Please grant me such devotion to You, O Syama, the I continue chanting Your
name. May my devotion to You become successful that You call me to Your abode
in Gokula.


 


Refrain:
This puny soul is calling out, O Jagadisa! O Lord of the Universe! O Hari!


 


2)
Whether in the sky, in the Himalayas, in the oceans, in the earth, in the
underworld, or hellish conditions, may I always hear the sweet sounds of
Â“Jagadisa HareÂ”


 


3)
Whenever I lose my vision and when fields of green become torched in fire, may
the star of Jagadish, Hari never break away.


 


4)
The difference between You and me, is that I am a mortal, and you are Narayana,
the best of all men. I am under the hands of the world, in which you also
redeem too.
