TRANSLATION


1)
Sri 
Krsna's
 loving consorts are decorated quite
befittingly with all the attractive womanly graces and charms such as gorgeous beauty
and loveliness. They are decorated with these qualities to the maximum possible
degree. And all of these consorts are abundantly thriving within the current of
the most highly treasured, super-sweet, and immeasurable reservoir of pure 
prema
. Thus, Sri 
Krsna's
 lovers
are especially 
relishable
 for Him within the vast
realm of transcendental mellows.


 


2)
Krsna has two main divisions of lovers --- those in 
sviya

(wedded love) and those in 
parakiya
 (unwedded love).
Heroines may also be classified as captivated, intermediate, and impudent. Some
of them take leading roles as heroines, whereas some of them simply want to
remain as an assisting friend or 
sakhi
 instead of
playing the role of a heroine.


 


3)
There are two chief 
gopis
 amongst all of Krsna
heroines --- 
Srimati
 
Radharani

and Sri 
Candravali
. Both of them are the reservoirs
of the qualities of supreme transcendental beauty and cunning behavior. Amongst
these two chief 
gopis
, 
Raddharani

is certainly the best, for 
She
 is most dear to Lord
Krsna. She is naturally the embodiment of the complete storehouse of the most
exalted, sublime ecstasy called 
mahabhava
.


 


4)
All the multitudes of 
Krsna's
 other dear lovers
divide themselves into two parties, identifying either with the entourage of 
Srimati
 
Radharani
 or with party
of 
Candravali
. And each of them, within her preferred
group, renders services in a thousand different ways for the pleasure of one of
these two predominant heroines. However, the real followers of 
Srila
 
Rupa
 
Gosvami

possess no wealth other than full consciousness of their eternal treasure under
the shelter of 
Srimati
 
Radharani's

divine lotus feet.
