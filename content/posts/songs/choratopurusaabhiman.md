TRANSLATION


1)
Gone is the vanity of male egoism, O Kana. Now I am Your faithful maidservant.


 


2) O
Lord of Radha, in the groves of Vraja I will perform devotional service as a
follower of one of the sakhis.


 


3) I
will string together a necklace of forest flowers, and tulasi buds shall be the
jewels of that necklace. 


 


4)
With utmost care I will place the garland in the hands of that confidential
devotee, and she will take it with affection.


 


5)
Then she will place the garland around both Your necks, while I watch in wonder
from afar.


 


6) The
confidant will then say to me, Â“Listen, O beautiful one, you should remain in
this grove as my attendant.Â”


 


7)
Â“Daily you shall string together beautiful flower garlands that will enchant
Radha and Krsna.Â” 


 


8)
Â“The responsibility for your maintenance shall be mine. My cottage in the grove
is yours.Â”


 


9)
Â“When I serve Radha and Madhava, you will attend behind me.Â”


 


10)
Â“After preparing tambula and bringing camphor, you will give them to me, knowing
me to be yours.Â”


 


11)
Bhaktivinoda, having heard all these instructions, bows down at the lotus feet
of that confidential sakhi.
