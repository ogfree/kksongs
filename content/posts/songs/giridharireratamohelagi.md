TRANSLATION


(Refrain):
Oh Lifter of Govardhana Hill! Giridhari! I have become attached to chanting
Your name.


 


1) In
the temple of my mind, I added jnana. After absorbing myself into Your name, I
became a maidservant of Your eternal abode.


 


2) Your
melodic glories are constantly sung. After receiving the real internal happiness,
what is the point of this material world?


 


3)
Surrendering unto Your feet, renouncing everything, and finally attaining You,
Oh Lord Syama. You are mine, and I am Yours.

song was featured in ISKCONÂ’s 1981 recording of Â“Prabhupada KrpaÂ” rendered by
