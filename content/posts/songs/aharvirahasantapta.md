TRANSLATION


1) O
Lord Krsna, during the day, the gopis became distressed feeling separation from
You. In order to cross over the great ocean of their grief, they loudly chanted
the glories of Your transcendental qualities.


 


2) O
Lord Krsna, (the gopis said that) Your face is tilted and it appears as beautiful
as a lotus flower. The blossoming flowers which are Your feet are crossed. Your
eyebrows and side-long glances are dancing and You are expert at playing the
flute.


 


3) O
Lord Krsna, the beauty of Your form enchants the entire universe and increases
the lusty desires of the wives of the Siddha demigods. You delight and amaze
the cows in the forest of Vraja-bhumi.


 


4) O
Lord Krsna, (when You pass by), the river Yamuna stops flowing, impelled by
ecstatic love. Full of love for You, the creepers and other plants shower
nectar, honey and whatever they have as an offering to You. The swans and other
birds walk by Your side and the clouds serve You by becoming like an umbrella
(to shade You from scorching sunshine).


 


5) O
Lord Krsna, (the gopis said that) Lord Brahma and the other demigods cannot
understand the complicated melodies You play on the flute. When You walk on the
earth, the touch of Your feet relieves the pain the earth feels when the cows
traverse it. When the gopis see You they become filled with lusty desires, and
become stunned, just as if they had become trees.


 


6) O
Lord Krsna, (the gopis said that) as You walk home fatigued at the end of the
day, You appear very handsome, and Your great beauty enchants the minds of the
wives of the deer. You bathe Your graceful limbs in the waters of the Yamuna
river, and the jubilant demigod Vayu worships You by blowing pleasant breezes.


 


7) O
Lord krsna, (the gopis said that) Lord Brahma and the other demigods offer
obeisances to Your lotus feet. With Your cheerful lotus face and Your
restlessly moving eyes shining with jubilation, You increase the bliss of Your
friends.


 


8) O
Lord Krsna, decorated with many garlands of forest-flowers, You move as
gracefully as the king of the elephants. You delight The gopis describe how
attractive You are, and You delight your mother. O Lord, please protect me.
