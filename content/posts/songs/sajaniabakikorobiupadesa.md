TRANSLATION


(Refrain)
O 
gopi
-friend, what shall I say to you? I have fallen
in love with 
Krsna
. My body and heart are now wild to
attain Him. I have not the slightest fear of breaking earthly religious
principles.


 


1)
I filled my eyes with the sight of His handsome form. As I remember the
sweetness of that form, the hairs of my body do not stop standing up with joy.
The enchanting sound of His flute entered my ears. Now I do not hear anything
else.


 


2)
When my nose smelled the fragrance of His body, I became wild. My mouth will
not speak any name but His. My heart is bound hg the ropes of His newer and
newer virtues. Where will the rules of dharma stay within me now?


 


3)

Govinda
 
dasa
 asks: When her
husband rebukes and her elders roar their disapproval, only a smile sprouts
within her. Who understands her smile? If she is indeed enchanted by 
Krsna
, only one desire must stay within her now.
