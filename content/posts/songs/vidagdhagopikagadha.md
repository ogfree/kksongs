TRANSLATION


1) O Lord 
Krsna
, O clever lion, understanding the intentions of the
intelligent 
gopis
, 
You

expertly answered their three profound questions.


 


2) O Lord 
Krsna
, (speaking to the 
gopis
), 
You
 justified Your ingratitude and other so-called faults,
and You mercifully described the most exalted and extraordinary state of pure
love for You. O Lord, please protect me.


 


3) O Lord 
Krsna
, You did not abandon the association of the 
gopis
, and indeed, 
Your
 mind
remained unsatisfied, even though You had given Yourself to them. You became
very eager to benedict 
Your
 dear friends whose love
for You had greatly increased during their separation from You.
