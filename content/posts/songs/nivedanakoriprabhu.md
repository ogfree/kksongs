TRANSLATION


1) I
submit at Your lotus feet, O Lord, that I am fallen and wretched, a fact known
to the three worlds.


 


2)
There is no sinner more sinful than me. In the entire material creation there
is no offender whose offenses equal mine.


 


3) By
attempting to clear myself of all these sins and offenses I am put to shame and
beg Your forgiveness. All this is understood by You.


 


4) Of
whom will I take shelter except for You? O son of the King of Vraja, You are
the Lord of all lords.


 


5)
This world is Yours, and You pervade all things in it. You forgive the offenses
committed against You.


 


6) You
alone are the shelter of those who have gone astray. Apart from You, what else
exists, O merciful Lord?


 


7)
Those like me who have offended You will know no peace until achieving Your
shelter.


 


8)
Bhaktivinoda takes shelter in You and surrenders himself at Your lotus feet on
this very day.
