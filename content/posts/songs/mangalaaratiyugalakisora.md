TRANSLATION


1)
Their girlfriends (
sakhis
) are praising the youthful
Divine Couple during Their 
Mangala
 
Arati
, singing 
jaya
! 
jaya
!


 


2)
A jeweled lamp is being swung around as an offering to 
Radha-Krsna
.
The 
sakhis
 behold the moonlike faces of bluish 
Krsna
 and golden 
Radha
.


 


3)
The girlfriends 
Lalita
 and 
Visakha

are absorbed in feelings of love. They are absorbed in worshipping both 
Radha
 and 
Krsna
 (with this 
mangala
 
arati
-ceremony). The
forest grove in 
Vrndavan
 beautifies the whole world.
Along with the enchanting form of the divine youthful Couple 
Radha
 and 
Krsna
.


 


4)
The parrots and the cuckoos sing and the peacocks dance in 
Vrndavan
.
The 
Cakora
-birds reject their beloved moon to stare
at the beautiful faces of 
Radha
 and 
Krsna
.


 


5)
Many kinds of musical instruments are being played busily. 
Syamananda

blissfully plays them for the divine Couple.
