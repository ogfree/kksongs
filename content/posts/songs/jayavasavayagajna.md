TRANSLATION


1) O Lord 
Krsna
, all glories unto 
You
. You
asked 
Your
 father why he was performing a sacrifice,
although You knew full well the sacrifice was to be offered to Lord 
Indra
. When 
You
 heard Your father's
description of the sacrifice's purpose, You replied by speaking the karma-
mimamsa
 philosophy (Which states that if one works nicely,
he will get the good result of his work, and there is no need of God.


 


2) O Lord 
Krsna
, by presenting many different false and illogical
arguments, 
You
 prohibited the performs of the
sacrifice to 
Indra
, and urged (the cowherd men) to
perform a sacrifice for the cows and 
Govardhana
 Hill.
O Lord, I offer respectful 
obeisances
 unto 
You
.


 


3) O Lord 
krsna
, 
You
 described how the sacrifice
for 
Govardhana
 Hill and the cows should be performed,
and when the sacrifice was performed, You assumed a separately constituted
gigantic form, claiming to be 
Govardhana
 Hill and
eating the foodstuffs offered in the sacrifice. 


 


4) O Lord 
Krsna
, O crest-jewel on the summit of 
Govardhana

Hill, O glorifier of 
Govardhana
 Hill, after the
cowherd men had offered ornaments and foodstuffs, You caused them to
circumambulate the Hill.
