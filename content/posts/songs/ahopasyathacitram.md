TRANSLATION


Refrain:
Look at the wonderful glories of Gokula! Numberless goddesses of fortune have
come to the auspicious ceremony of Lord Krsna's wedding!


 


1) See
how Radha is the happiest and the most beautiful of all. See how She stands in
peerless, eternal youth.


 


2)
King Nanda has arranged that his son be gloriously dressed and decorated for
the occasion. Filled with love, Balarama and all the royal relatives have come
from Dvaraka.


 


3)
Even the three worlds cannot hold all the joy in King Nanda's heart. I think
his heart must be filled with joy as he yearns to hear the marriage vows.
