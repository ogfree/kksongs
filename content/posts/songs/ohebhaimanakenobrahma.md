TRANSLATION


1)
Oh brothers! Why does my rascal mind desire to merge into the Brahman effulgence?
How astonishing it is! And to whom shall I admit it? My dear mind, please tell
me why you want to merge yourself wit that Supreme Brahman, considering it to
be the most 
worshipable
 thing?


 


2)
A drop of water certainly has the qualities of the ocean, but is obviously not
the ocean itself in quantity. A small dwarf cannot possibly touch the moon,
despite his best intentions. And a handful of dust can never assume that it has
become a mountain. Alas! Alas! Such a pitiful position is foolishly upheld by
those who advocate the philosophy of merging into the Lord's bodily effulgence!
The only profit from such doctrines is that it will make one become offensive
towards the Lord, which will hinder one from attaining the supreme objective of
devotion


 


3)
Renouncing this mischievous mentality of trying to artificially merge, my dear
mind! Just purify your existence and start searching for the process of getting
real love for Krsna. If you would just try to understand the statements of the
revealed scriptures, you will find that all the conceptions like 
sayujya
 (oneness with the Lord), and nirvana (the highest
blissful absorption) are actually different features which are automatically
achieved by devotion, fro these benefits are unconsciously following the
process of service to the Lord.


 


4)
Statements like "tat 
tvam
 
asi
"
(you belong to Krsna) are fully permeated with real tangible love for Krsna,
and meditating on such Veda statements helps the aspiring devotee to ultimately
attain the shelter of 
Krsna's
 lotus feet. Then one
will gain residence in 
Krsna's
 transcendental abode
of 
Vrndavana
, which is completely pervaded with
supreme, undivided bliss. Thus one will come to know the original personal form
of 
Parabrahman
, Who is situated far beyond the
impersonal Brahman effulgence.


 


5)
The network of transcendental rays emanating from His body form the splendorous
light known as the Brahman effulgence, which is powerful enough to amaze the
entire collection of material universes. If any of the conditioned souls desire
to become content by merging into that glowing light, then that would be just
like being satisfied at night with the glow of lightning bugs in the absence of
the sun. The insignificant light emitted by such insects will certainly never
serve as a replacement for the radiant sun, and similarly the devotees of Krsna
is never content to merge with the Brahman effulgence, which is very feeble in
comparison to the Lord's original form of bliss.


 


6)
If ever there is dawning of one's good fortune, then one will see 
Vrndavana
 shining gracefully before his very eyes due to
taking complete shelter of the virtuous devotees and spiritual masters. Then,
becoming irresistibly attracted by Krsna, one runs and chases after His (the 
Parabrahman
). Thus he simply leaves aside the insignificant
realization of merging with the Brahman effulgence, for gets completely
overwhelmed by the slightest contact with 
Krsna's

transcendental mellows. 


 


7)
Discuss and deliberate on this, my friends, make your life successful just like
the great sages like 
Sukadeva
, 
Narada
,

Vyasa
 etc., who all gave up Brahman realization by
becoming attracted by Krsna, and then this servant 
Bhaktivinoda

will hold on to your feet.
