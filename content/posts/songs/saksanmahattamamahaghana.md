TRANSLATION


1)
May Nandisvara Hill, where the Supreme Personality of Godhead, crowned with a
peacock feather and splendid as a monsoon cloud, enjoyer of pastimes, delight
me.


 


2)
May Nandisvara Hill, rich with the nectar rivers of Krsna's pastimes that
please the grass of the living entities in the world, and previously the place
of happiness for a great monsoon cloud, delight me.


 


3)
With his son and wife King Nanda lived on Nandisvara Hill. The good-fortune of
Nandisvara Hill was never attained by any other mountain. What is tiny Mount Meru in comparison to it? May Nandisvara Hill delight me.


 


4)
May Nandisvara Hill, where the king of Vraja had his capitol of splendid
palaces with spires and domes where a peacock could be seen happily dancing
among the colourful victory flags, delight me.


 


5)
Krsna sometimes climbs its aromatic summit and sits on a rock, gazing out with
thirsty eyes at the twelve forests that are the great petals of the Vrajabhumi
lotus spread beneath Him. May Nandisvara Hill delight me.


 


6)
May Nandisvara Hill, which by sprinkling the nectar waters of it's lakes
fragrant with lotus flowers defeats the glory of the most exalted holy places
in the three worlds, delight me.


 


7)
May Nandisvarah Hill, which has at its base a lake named Pavana that purifies
and liberates all its touches with the purifying breeze from its shore, delight
me.


 


8)
May Nandisvara Hill, which has at its peak a great and splendid sapphire
treasure named Krsna, which was seen by the demigod Brahma, and which may be
gotten by the most pious person, delight me.


 


9)
O Nandisvara Hill, O king of mountains, please be kind to they who try to
glorify you by reading these prayers. Even if such readers are infested with
hundreds of sinful desires, please transform them into great devotees, full of
devotion for their spiritual master, and thirsty for the nectar of Krsna's
lotus feet.
