TRANSLATION


1) Â“Look, O 
sakhi
, how 
Radha-Syama
 are
swinging! Various musical instruments are being played, and songs are sung with
beautiful voices and with nice rhythms and tunes.Â”


 


2) Â“The month of 
Asadha
 (June-July, when it is very hot) is gone and the 
Sravana
 month (July-August) has come on the delightful bank
of the 
Yamuna
. The moon is rising in the blissful
night sky and a gentle Malayan (southern) breeze is blowing.Â”


 


3) Â“The lakes are full and
the trees are blooming (due to profuse rain at that time of the year) and the
clouds rumble deeply in the sky. The lightning flashes and drops of rain are
showered.Â”


 


4) Â“A swing is hung there
on 
jewelled
 ropes in the cool shade of a
wish-yielding tree. On it 
Gauri
 
Radha

and 
Syama
 
Krsna
 are seated
and pushed by 
sakhis
 who stand on each side.Â”


 


5) Â“Their bodies resemble
the lightning (
Radha
) and the clouds (Krsna) as 
They
 oscillate on the swing. Their faces, that resemble
golden and blue 
lotusflowers
, show drops of
perspiration and are adorned with tenderly smiling lips.Â”


 


6) Â“Some 
sakhi
, seeing that the swinging reaches a climax, starts
fanning, others offer betel-leaves, and others sing the 
surata
,

megha
 and 
mallara
 ragas
while playing fascinating 
mrdanga
.Â”


 


7) Â“
Radha

and Krsna wear excellent flower-garlands that dance in so many ways [along with
the oscillating swing] while the bees buzz around them. Swans, peacocks and
cranes sing with beautiful voices and the frogs croak loudly.Â”


 


8) Â“
Radha

and 
Krsna
 wear sandalwood-
tilaka

on 
Their
 foreheads that astonishes even the moon.
Krsna wears a beautiful wiggling peacock-feather crown and 
Radha

has a braid that dangles on 
Her
 back down to Her
buttocks.Â”


 


9) Â“Their restlessly
dangling earrings shimmer on 
Their
 ears and They wear
moon-stone necklaces on Their chests. Their ornaments glitter and chime along
with the rhythm of the swinging. In this way the 
Jhulan
-pastimes
is ended.Â”


 


10) Â“Some 
sakhis
 grind fragrant sandalwood. Looking at the limbs of 
Syama
 and 
Gauri
 some 
sakhi
 gives a verbal hint to 
Uddhava


Dasa
 to go and pick flowers.Â”
