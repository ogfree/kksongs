TRANSLATION


1) The 
gopis

assembled in the forest. Seeing 
Krsna
 play the flute,
they smiled. 
Krsna
 glanced at their faces and asked
them some questions. He plunged them in an ocean of love.


 


2) He asked of their journey
through the forest was good and auspicious. He wished them well. But why did He
talk to them of love? Why did He glance at them with crooked eyes?


 


3) "You can see this
night is very fearsome. Why did you girls leave your husbands' embraces and come
to the forest?" Why did 
Krsna
 speak these words?



 


4) "Your graceful
braids have become loose. Why did you girls run here? Was there a quarrel in
your homes?" As an army surrounds its 
oppnent
,
the 
gopis
 surrounded Lord 
Krsna
.


 


5) "This autumn night
is splendid with its moonlight. This forest grove is filled with flowers. You
can see the black bees are very glorious here. Did you girls know all this
before you came here?"


 


6) Lord 
Krsna

spoke these words, but no 
gopi
 offered a reply. Why
did they always keep 
Krsna
 in their hearts? No 
gopi
 offered a reply. 
Govinda
 
dasa
 sings this song.
