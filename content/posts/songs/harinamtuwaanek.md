TRANSLATION


1)
O Harinama, You possess unlimited forms, such as the beloved son of Mother
Yasoda, the increaser of the bliss of Gokula, the son of Nanda, and the
reservoir of all transcendental mellows.


 


2)
You are the slayer of the demons Putana and Trnavarta, the breaker of the cart,
the protector of the cows, the player of the flute, the destroyer of the demons
Agha and Baka, the holder of Govardhan Hill, and You are a cowherd boy.


 


3)
You destroyed the Kesi demon, bewildered Lord Brahma, and broke the pride of
Indra, king of Heaven. You are the destroyer of Aristasura, the enchanter of
all the young girls of Gokula, and You sport along the sandy banks of the river
Yamuna.


 


4)
You delight Srimati Radhika and give life to the rasa dance. You sport in the
groves near Radha Kunda, performing a variety of pastimes. You are the
reservoir of pleasure, attractive to every living being. You remove all
inauspiciousness and are the husband of the goddess of fortune. You are the
source of all incarnations such as Lord Nrsimha, the half-man half-lion
incarnation and Matsya, the fish avatara.


 


5)
O Harinam, You are pleasing to the cows, land and senses. You are the dwarf
brahmana incarnation (Vamana) and the slayer of the demon Madhu. You are the
moon of the Yadu dynasty and always wear beautiful garlands of fresh forest
flowers. You are the destroyer of the Kaliya serpent, the delighter of Gokula
and You rejoice in the worship of Srimati Radharani.


 


6)
Thakura Bhaktivinoda, understanding Your glories, clasps the lotus feet of Rupa
Goswami and Swarup Damodar Goswami and prays, Â“O Harinam, according to Your
sweet will You are manifest in all these forms and in many others also. Please
let them increase my love and attachment for You.Â”
