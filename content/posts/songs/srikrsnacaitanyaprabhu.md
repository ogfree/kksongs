WORD
FOR WORD TRANSLATION: 
Sri Krsna
Caitanya Prabhu Doya Koro More


 


TRANSLATION


1)
My dear Lord Caitanya, please be merciful to me, because who can be more
merciful than Your Lordship within these three worlds?


 


2)
Your incarnation is just to reclaim the conditioned, fallen souls, but I assure
You that You will not find a greater fallen soul than me. Therefore, my claim
is first.


 


3)
My dear Lord Nityananda, You are always joyful in spiritual bliss. Since You
always appear very happy, I have come to You because I am most unhappy. If You
kindly put Your glance over me, then I may also become happy.


 


4)
My dear Advaita Prabhu, husband of Sita, You are so kind. Please be merciful to
me. If You are kind to me, naturally Lord Caitanya and Nityananda will also be
kind to me.


 


5)
GauraÂ’s love embodiment is shown by Gadadhara Pandita. Srinivasa Pandita and
Haridasa Thakura are the ocean of mercy.


 


6)
O Svarupa Damodara, personal secretary of Lord Caitanya, O six Gosvamis O Sri
Rupa Gosvami, Sri Sanatana Gosvami, Sri Raghunatha Bhatta Gosvami, Sri Gopala
Bhatta Gosvami, Sri Jiva Gosvami, and Sri Raghunatha dasa Gosvami! O Lokanatha
Gosvami, my beloved spiritual master! Narottama dasa also prays for your mercy.


 


7)
O Srinivasa Acarya, successor to the six Gosvamis! Please be merciful to me.
Narottama dasa always desires the company of Ramacandra Cakravarti.


 


Remarks/ Extra Information
: 


Sri
Caitanya Saraswat Math says Â“majhāreÂ” in place of Â“samsāre.Â”


 


Verse
5 is found in the older books. Translation is Â“Lord CaitanyaÂ’s love is embodied
in Gadadhara Pandita. The ocean of mercy is embodied by Srinivasa Acarya and
Srila Haridasa Thakura.Â”


 


In
Rksaraja PrabhuÂ’s 1978 tape Â“Reservoir of PleasureÂ”, he sings, Â“doya koro gaura
sakti pandita gadadhara, srinivasadi bhakta vrnda more doya kora.Â” which means,
Â“Please merciful to me, O energy of Lord Caitanya, Pandita Gadadhara. O
Srinivasa Acarya and the devotees in the disciplic succession, please be
merciful to me.Â”


 


This
song is commonly heard in Raga Misra Kafi in Tintal.
