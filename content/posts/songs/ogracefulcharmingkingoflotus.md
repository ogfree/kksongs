LYRICS:


(1)


O
graceful charming king of lotus flowers,


O rake
whose cooling glorious charming moon


Like
face now places a limitless glorious boon


Of
bliss and grace on the million million bowers


 


(2)


Of
blossoms that are Your every limb, and showers


Endless
floods of nectar that make noon


Of night
in the gardens of Your smiles O soon


To be
speaking smiling king of pleasant hours,


 


(3)


To us
gentle-hearted gopis please make clear


Why
amongst us You have come We pray


With
Your kind sweet words and deeds You'll please us.


 


(4)


We
trust and hope O charming smiling dear


King
of the lotus flowers You'll not play


The
role of taking joking tolls to tease us.
