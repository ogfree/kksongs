WORD
FOR WORD TRANSLATION: 
Ami Jamuna Puline


 


TRANSLATION


1)
Oh sakhi! My dear girlfriend! What have I seen today? In a kadamba grove on the
banks of the Yamuna, a beautiful blackish boy holding a long flute (vamsi) is
seated upon a throne of jewels, performing His pastimes as the King of all
transcendental mellows!


 


2)
Situated upon the eight petals of the jeweled altar is Sri Radha and Sri Hari
surrounded by Their attendants the eight chief gopis. There Krsna performs His
amorous pastimes which are just like a waterfall of nectar.


 


3)
By singing sweet songs and by dancing nicely, all the gopis satisfy the
treasured Divine Couple. Thus I am beholding Krsna's pastimes with His
beautiful female consorts expanding throughout the splendorous forest.


 


4)
For the sake of the mellows of such pastimes, I will not go to my home, but I
will instead enter into the forest. Renouncing all shyness due to fear of
family members, just worship the Lord of Vraja. This is the humble submission of
Bhaktivinoda.
