TRANSLATION


1)

Sambhoga
 is defined as follows: it is that ecstatic
mutual mood between the young couple 
Radha
 and 
Krsna
 which is enhanced by looking at each other, by
embracing, by worshipping and attending each other favorably, which surmounts
the highest pinnacle of elated bliss, and which is present within both 
Their
 hearts as personified 
rasa
.
Such a mood of 
Theirs
 together is called 
sambhoga
.


 


2)

Sambhoga
 expands nicely into two main headings, 
mukhya
 (primary), and 
gauna

(secondary). Both of these headings can each have four varieties of contacts,
namely 1) 
samksipst
 (very brief and simple meeting),
2) 
samkirna
 (narrow --- slightly hindered by fear,
etc.), 3) 
sampanna
 (affluent --- a warm loving
meeting after a sojourn), and 4) 
samrddhimana
 
sambhoga
 (fully enriched to the maximum). Each of these
four types of union follows one of four types of separation as follows:


 


3)
The systematic appearance of the four 
mukhya
 
sambhogas
 are 1) 
samksipt
 
sambhoga
, occurs after 
purva
-raga
(simple union after preliminary affection), 2) 
sankirna


sambhoga
 occurs after 
mana

(narrow union after pouting), 3) 
sampanna
 
sambhoga
 occurs after a brief 
pravasa

(affluent union after a short sojourn), and 4) 
samrddhimana


sambhoga
 occurs after a long 
pravasa

(fully enriched union after a long sojourn).


 


4)
The 
sampanna
 
sambhoga
 has
two variations which produce very enchanting unions. They are two types of
arrivals: 1) 
agati
 (formal or pre-arranged arrival)
and 2) 
pradurbhava
 (sudden appearance among those who
are eager). Also there are meetings and pastimes together in dreams. These
factual dream-
lilas
 come under the second heading as 
gauna
 
sambhoga
 (secondary
category of union).
