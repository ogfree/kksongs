TRANSLATION


1)
In 
Saci's
 courtyard crawls infant 
Gauracandra
,
who charms all the worlds. For a moment He grasps His mother's finger and
walks. Then again He crawls and crawls. Sometimes He walks a few steps, and
then again He tumbles to the ground.


 


2)
As He crawls a splendid tiger-claw necklace swings to and fro on His chest. A
lightning-flash smile glistens on the moon of His face. Now His every limb is
anointed with dust. How can His mother bear it? She picks Him up.


 


3)
He is agitated. He cries. Child 
Gaura
 scrambles from
His mother's lap. She places Him on the ground. Again He crawls. 
Murari
 smiles and says: This is not just another little boy
on his mother's lap. This is Lord 
Hari
 
withn
 a fair complexion, Lord 
Hari

who later will become a 
sannyasi
.


 


REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:


This
is to be sung in Raga 
Pahadi
.
