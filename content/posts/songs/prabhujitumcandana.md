TRANSLATION


1)
Lord, if you are sandalwood, I am water; fragranced by You in all parts of my
body.



2) Lord, if you are a cloud, I am a peacock; looking for You like a cakora for
the full moon.






3)
Lord, if you are a lamp, I am the wick; with the light of love burning day and
night.






4)
Lord, if you are a pearl, I am the thread; just as as gold looks beautiful when
adorned on a beautiful married woman.






5)
Lord, you are the master and I am Your servant, Raidasa, who is always
performing devotion to You.


 


6)
There is no escape; I have already been attached to the name of chanting of
Lord RamaÂ’s name.
