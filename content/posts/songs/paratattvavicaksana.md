TRANSLATION


(1-2)
Oh my Lord! All the great sages headed by 
Srila
 
Vyasadeva
 are most experienced and wise regarding the transcendental
truth. This is because they discuss and deliberate on the revealed scriptures
again and again. Thereby they help to manifest these sacred literatures which
reveal 
Your
 eternal personal form abounding in all
virtuous qualities, Your divine character which is the very essence of
ambrosial nectar as well as Your eternal pastimes of pure transcendental
goodness. These principle scriptures thus prescribe the path of auspicious
well-being for all souls. However, those unfortunate souls who are blinded by
the material modes of passion and ignorance, who harbor the nature of demons,
and who are foolish and dull-minded cannot possibly understand 
Your
 divine form or pastimes which are described throughout
all these scriptures.


 


3)
Those 
who
 live in this universe but are not interested
in Your eternal form remain completely oblivious just like ignorant frogs who
live in a small, shallow well. Now 
Bhaktivinoda

sings, alas! What an unfortunate, sorry situation has arisen here! For it seems
that the eternal servants of 
Hari
 have not become
fixed up in the service of their eternal Lord 
Hari
.
