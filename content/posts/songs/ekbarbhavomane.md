TRANSLATION


1)
Consider this just once! While you wander in this world, under the control of
material desires, what happiness will you achieve in this mundane life? Who are
you? Where have you come from? How did you come here? What have you done? And
where will you go at the time of death when your body drops?


 


2)
What is the use of so much worldly happiness, distress and fear, which arise
from the false egotism of "I" and "mine"? And what is the
use of insignificant victory and defeat, anger, violence, and envy toward other
living beings? Bhaktivinoda says, "Just take shelter at the lotus feet of
Lord Gaurasundara and sing the names of Radha and Krsna, and you will become
saturated with the mellows of pure spiritual bliss."
