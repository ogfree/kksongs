TRANSLATION


1)
May I eternally stay in Vraja birth after birth with the service of Sri
Rupa-manjari's and Sri Rati-manjari's feet my only desire.


 


2-3)
When, out of love streams of tears falling from my eyes to the ground, my body
pale and trembling, and the erect hairs of my body bathed in perspiration, will
I meditate on Sri Sri Radha-Krsna, the smiling divine couple expert at enjoying
pastimes of amorous battle?


 


4)
O friend, when will I see Lord Krsna, His handsome transcendental form crushing
the pride of a new tamala tree on a sapphire mountain, His sleepy eyes and face
praised by the full moon, and Radha asleep on His chest?


 


5)
O friend, by the mercy of His feet, with love will I make for Lord Krsna a
necklace of many different splendid jewels, and, the hairs of my body erect
with excitement, place it in Sri Radha's hand? 


 


6)
"Why must Your intelligence be devoured by this jealous anger?"
Learning from a parrot that the Syama-gopi who spoke these words was actually
Krsna in disguise, Radha became stunned with happiness and at once embraced
Him.


 


7)
Friend, who is this person as splendid as a monsoon cloud, wearing a
peacock-feather crown, forest-flower ornaments, and garments that rebuke gold,
and playing a flute, holding it to lips more glorious than the full moon, who
has stolen my heart?


 


8)
"O Lalita, listen to the wonderful dream I had!" 


"O
friend, please tell me."


"In
this dream you and I were picking flowers in the forest when Kamadeva, who had
assumed a transcendental body handsome as a monsoon cloud, glanced at You,
smiled, and passionately embraced you."


 


9)
Seeing Krsna's anguish, the flute has become silent and all moving and
non-moving creatures born in Vraja forest have become thin and wasted.
Surrounded by alarmed friends, emaciated Krsna rolls on the ground. O Radha,
now again and again You may joyfully feed the snake of Your jealous anger with
the most excellent milk. 


 


10)
"O Radha, where have You gone? Please be kind and sprinkle some happiness
on this dependent servant approaching You." When anxious Krsna again and
again sounded this song in the opening of His flute, She smiled crookedly.


 


11)
O beautiful one, who is this smiling, dark-complexioned dancer placing with two
fingers a straight arrow on the bow of flowers in His left hand, and His
restless glances arousing amorous desire, as, surrounded by friends, He moves
before us in the dancing-arena?
Â Â  


 


12)
O friend, when, coming from the splendid forest grove scented with camphor,
kunkuma, flower garlands, and ornaments fallen from Their transcendental
amorous pastimes, will the divine couple happily cast a smiling glance at me,
whose eyes yearn to see Them?
Â  


 


13)
I offer my respectful obeisances to a wonderful cuckoo more splendid than gold
and greedy to taste the sweetness of the flower of Lord Krsna's lips.


 


14)
Let me eternally glorify the wonderful bumblebee, decorated with yellow
garments and crowned with a peacock feather, who yearns to drink the nectar of
Radha's bimba fruit lips.
Â Â  


 


15)
O foolish hero of Vraja, do not be proud, thinking "My glory has defeated
the moon."
Â  
After all, the flood of
tears flowing from the eyes of the wives of Your enemies has defeated the ocean
that is the moon's father.
Â  


 


16)
"Friend, who is this girl We have never seen before?" 


"She
is a vraja-gopi?"


"From
where has she come? Why has she come?"


"She
has come from Mathura-pura to worship You."


 


When
She heard the playful words "Now You may enjoy with the incomparable Lord
Hari" Radha understood that the girl was Krsna in disguise and at once
burst into a smile.


 


17)
"Because of Your own good fortune the moonlight decorating this jeweled
forest-cottage now dispels the darkness in the middle of this pleasant night. O
thirsty cakora bird, please come down from Your sky at once and enjoy this
moonlight before the angry rises and chases it far away." 


 


Note:
If the word indukanti is interpreted to mean Sri Radha, and if the word
abhimanyu to mean Abhimanyu, then the verse may be understood to mean:
"Because of Your own good fortune the girl Radha' decorating this jeweled
forest-cottage now dispels the darkness in the middle of this pleasant night. O
thirsty cakora bird, please come down from Your sky at once and enjoy with
Radha' before Abhimanyu takes Her far away."


 


18)
When, as the cakori bird worships nectar moonlight, as the crying cataki bird
worships a splendid cloud filled with unmoving lightning, and as the black bee
worships a tamala tree where a golden vine rests, will my eyes worship Lord
Hari embraced by Sri Radha? 


 


19)
Let us glorify Lord Krsna's perfect flute. When Her friends overcome with
grief, the sweet words of a host of gopis messengers, and even Lord Krsna
sprinkling the dust of Her feet on His head cannot extinguish it, Lord Krsna's
flute at once stops the fire of Radha's jealous anger.


 


20)
"O friend, without the pastime-place of Vraja, which is dearer to Me than
life, and without My father, mother, friends, the gopis, and one special gopi,
the city of Dvaraka has become poison to Me." Hearing sleeping Krsna speak
these words, Satyabhama, with many sweet words, begged Him to let her see the 
land
 of 
Vraja
.


 


21)
Friend, look at this golden jasmine vine resting on the chest of this tamala
tree. Look at this black bee flying for a long time among these blossoming
flowers. These sights remind me of smiling Radha, more splendid than lightning
as She sits on the lap of Lord Krsna who eclipses the splendor of monsoon
clouds.
