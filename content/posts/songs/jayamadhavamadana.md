Jaya Madhava Madana
Murari


 


TRANSLATION


(Refrain)
Glories to the husband of the goddess of fortune, who is the transcendental
Cupid and the enemy of the demon Mura. Glories to the divine couple Radhe Syama,
also known as Syama Syama! Glories to Lord Kesava, who has fine hair, who
removes the miseries of the age of KaliÂ—Radhe Syama Syama Syama!


 


1)
O Krsna, You wear beautiful earrings, and You have lovely widened eyes. Around
Your neck hangs the splendorous vaijanti flower garland. Your complexion is
most excellentÂ—Radhe Syama Syama Syama!


 


2)
Sometimes You secretly plunder yogurt and eat it, and sometimes You design a
rasa-dance performance with the young gopis in the forest of Madhuvana. There
dances Vipina-Vihari, You who love to sport in the forestÂ— Radhe Syama Syama
Syama!


 


3)
You herd the cows in the company of the cowherd boys. You, the monarch of the
Yadu dynasty, thus wander from forest to forest, carrying a blanket draped over
Your shoulderÂ— Radhe Syama Syama Syama!


 


4)
Because You, O Murari, repeatedly steal fresh butter from the homes of the
women of Vraja and secretly eat it, they have named You Â‘Makhan-ChorÂ’ (the
butter thief)Â— Radhe Syama Syama Syama!


 


5)
One day You curbed the pride of Indra by lifting the great mountain Govardhana
upon the tip of Your fingernail, thus winning for Yourself the name GiridhariÂ—
Radhe Syama Syama Syama!


 


6)
You did not accept the sumptuous feast of the wicked Duryodhana, but took the
coarse food offered by Your devotee Vidura. Therefore You are worshipped by
love and not by mere ritualsÂ—RÃ¤dhe Radhe Syama Syama Syama!


 


7)
To bestow mercy upon Draupadi, You, the Lord of the forest, supplied unlimited
cloth to protect her from shame, while the assembly of men and women looked onÂ—
Radhe Syama Syama Syama!


 


8)
You deliver each of Your devotees in unique ways. Alas, we who are bereft of
devotion are standing here outside Your door. Please favorably receive the news
of our presenceÂ— Radhe Syama Syama Syama!


 


9)
You were the driver of ArjunaÂ’s chariot, and on the battlefield You gave Arjuna
the instructions of the Bhagavad-Gita. During the fight You exhibited Your form
as the wielder of the discus SudarsanaÂ— Radhe Syama Syama Syama!
