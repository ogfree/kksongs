TRANSLATION


1) From the moment I saw
Lord 
Gaura
, the ever new abode of desire; I have been
able to remain at home no longer. How many tricks will I use to get away? How
much water can I draw from 
Suradhuni
? How often can I
go to the river bank?


 


2) There is no one to whom
I can speak other than Providence. As much as my proud guardians scold me,
there is no place that I can cry out my heartfelt pain.


 


3) When 
Gauranga

looked at me, He snagged my heart with the hook of His reddish glance. Let my
family obligations go to hell! Who knows what the end result of all this will
be?


 


4) I have brought all of
this upon myself, for I was drawn outside when I heard the 
mrdanga

and the 
karatalas
' sound. 
Laksmikanta


dasa
 says: '' Can a family scandal scare those who
have fathomed 
Gauranga's
 sweetness? ''
