TRANSLATION


1) There is no one like 
Gauranga
! No other incarnation past, present or future
preached such a rare form of 
prema
. (He never
considered any offense. Therefore, He is even more merciful than Krsna).


 


2) He did not slay the very
wicked or the fallen atheists (instead He changed their mood). Giving out the
holy names, He went from door to door, purifying everyoneÂ’s heart.


 


3) Even Brahma and 
Sankara
 hankered for that divine love which 
Gauranga
 is pouring over the whole world. When the
miserable and wretched people receive this 
prema
,
they begin to dance and clap their hands with joy. 


 


4) Laughing and weeping,
their voices choked with love and their hairs standing on end, even the 
candalas
 (dog-eaters) and 
brahmanas

embrace one another [being freed from all material designations]. When has such
a drama ever been seen before?


 


5) Playing loudly on 
mrdanga
 and 
karatalas
, Sri 
Caitanya
 
Mahaprabhu
 and His party
roamed everywhere, chanting 
KrsnaÂ’s
 names. Seeing the

sankirtana
 party, 
Yamaraja

(death personified) became afraid and closed his door.


 


6) All the three worlds
become filled with bliss by the auspicious uproar of the 
kirtana
.

Premananda
 
dasa
 laments
bitterly, Â“
Oh, that
 
Gauranga

is so merciful, yet 
rati
 for Him has not appeared in
my heart.Â”
