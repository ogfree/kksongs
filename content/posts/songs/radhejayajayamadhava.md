TRANSLATION


(Refrain)
O Radha! O beloved of Madhava! O You who are worshiped by all the young girls
of Gokula! All glories unto You! All glories unto You!


 


1)
You who dress Yourself in such a way as to increase Lord Damodara's love and
attachment for You! O queen of Vrndavana, which is the pleasure grove of Lord
Hari!


 


2)
O new moon that has arisen from the ocean of King Vrsabhanu! O friend of
Lalita! O You who make Visakha loyal to You due to Your wonderful qualities of
friendliness, kindness, and faithfulness to Krsna!


 


3)
O You who are filled with compassion! O You whose divine characteristics are
described by the great sages Sanaka and Sanatana! O Radha, please be merciful
to me!


 


REMARKS/EXTRA
INFORMATION:


This
song is usually rendered in Raga Durga by most devotees. However, the original
Stavamala text is requires it rendered in Raga Bhairavi. The Abhay Charan
serial sings this correctly.
