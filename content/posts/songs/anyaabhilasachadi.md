TRANSLATION


1)
Srila Rupa Gosvami Prabhupada has said (Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu 1.1.11)


"Uttama
bhakti, or unalloyed devotion unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri
Krsna, involves the rendering of devotional service in a way that is favourable
to the Lord.Â  This devotional service should be free from any extraneous motive
and devoid of fruitive karma, impersonal jnana and all other selfish
desires."*


 


2)
Rejecting all other desires, and abandoning philosophical speculation and
fruitive work, in the company of the devotees I will worship and serve Lord
Krsna with my body and mind. I will not worship the demigods and
demigoddesses.Â  Devotional service is the reason for my life.


 


3)
Devotedly follow the path of the great devotees in the past.Â  Properly using
your body and mind, don't neglect either the regulative devotional practices or
the remembrance of the Lord's pastimes.


 


4)
Always reject the company of the impious.Â  Give up attraction to non-devotional
songs.Â  Leave the karmis and jnanis far away.Â  Only associate with the
devotees.Â  Take pleasure in hearing the nectar descriptions of pure love for
Krsna.Â  Become flooded by the nectar of the narrations of the Lord's pastimes
in Vraja.


 


5)
Putting the yogis, svamis, karmis, jnanis, demigod-worshippers, and meditators
far away, and rejecting the torments that are fruitive work, ordinary religion,
and the other yogas, worship Lord Giridhari.


 


6)
The struggle to travel to various holy pilgrimage places is simply the mind's
mistake, because to make spiritual advancement all one actually needs is the
lotus feet of Lord Govinda.Â  Abandoning pride and envy, and with firm faith in
your heart, always worship Lord Govinda without deviation.


 


7)
See the devotees of Lord Krsna, associate with the devotees of Lord Krsna.Â 
Faithfully engage in the nine-fold process of devotional service, which
includes hearing about the Lord, chanting His glories, worshipping Him,
offering obeisances to Him, and remembering Him.Â  Following these activities
enlightens the devotees with spiritual knowledge.


 


8)
I shall use these senses to serve Lord Govinda, and I shall decline to worship
the various demigods and demigoddesses.Â  I shall only speak about pure
devotional service.Â  The numberless different philosophies and conceptions of
life are all products of the conditioned soul's pride.Â  Trying to understand
them brings no real benefit but only a pain within the mind.


 


9)
The insubordinate senses are like enemies that live within the body.Â  Tell the
ear to hear and it may rebel, refusing to hear. Â Tell the mind to understand a
particular point, or become firm in a certain way, and it may very well
disobey.


 


10)
I shall fight with lust, anger, bewilderment, greed, madness, envy and pride.Â 
Defeating them, I will become blissful at heart, and I will easily become able
to worship Lord Govinda.


 


11)
Lust I will engage in offering the fruits of my work to Lord Krsna.Â  Anger I
will direct towards the enemies of the devotees.Â  Greed I will engage by being
greedy to hear the topics of Lord Hari in the association of the saintly
devotees.Â  Bewilderment will be manifested because I cannot immediately attain
my worshipable Lord.Â  Madness will be there when I madly glorify the
transcendental attributes of Lord Krsna.Â  In this way I will engage each of
these in the service of Lord Krsna.


 


12)
If lust is not controlled, then it becomes the breeding ground for a host of
vices and checks one's advancement on the path of devotional service.Â  However,
if one stays in the association of the saintly devotees, then that association
will carry him beyond the influence of lust, anger, and their friends.


 


13)
I shall not become angry.Â  I shall renounce anger.Â  I shall become free from my
six enemies, such as greed and bewilderment.Â  I shall control my mind, and
always remember Lord Krsnacandra.


 


14)
When lust and his friends hear the word "Govinda" they immediately
begin to flee, as a herd of elephants flees when it hears a lion's roar.Â  If
one engages in single-pointed devotional service to Lord Krsna, then the
worshipper attains transcendental bliss, and all kinds of calamities flee from
him.


 


15)
Don't sin.Â  Take no interest in profit, adoration, and distinction.Â  Instead
meditate on the lotus feet of Lord Govinda.Â  In this way all sufferings will go
far away and transcendental bliss and pure love for Lord Krsna will
spontaneously come.


 


16)
Give up the association of the impious non-devotees.Â  Give up the tendency to
find fault in others.Â  Don't follow any spiritual path other than devotional
service.Â  Don't worship the demigods.Â  If one takes to the worship of the
demigods, he becomes deviated from the path of devotional service.


 


17)
O brother, please become attached to your worshipable Lord alone.Â  Serve Him
without deviation and sing the glories of His pastimes.Â  I will now quote the
words of Hanuman, who demonstrates this exclusive devotion to one's worshipable
Deity.Â  Hanuman said: Although He is not different from Lord Narayana,
lotus-eyed Lord Rama alone is the be-all and end-all of my life.


 


18)
If one attains the planets of the demigods or Pitas and enjoys celestial
happiness there, then I congratulate him, saying:Â  well done, well done.Â 
However, I myself would never strive to attain such a thing.Â  For myself I am
content simply to worship the Divine Couple and swim and float in the bliss of
pure love for Them.Â  This pure love is the most valuable object in the three
worlds.


 


19)
Although I have taken great trouble to try to enjoy the miserable
sense-gratification available in this world, I shall now give it up.Â  I shall
now reside in Vraja, serve Lord Govinda, hear and chant the topics of Lord
Krsna, chant the holy names of Lord Krsna, and at every moment relish the
transcendental mellows of devotional service in the association of the
residents of Vraja.


 


20)
I shall always aspire to serve the Lord, and great faith in the Lord will
become manifested in my mind.Â  In this way I shall remain always fearless in
all situations.Â  Narottama dasa says: Somehow or other I have accepted the role
of a non-devotee.Â  O my master, O great soul, please deliver me.
