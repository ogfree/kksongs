TRANSLATION


1) 
Śrī
 
Rukmiṇī

said: O beauty of the worlds, having heard of 
Your

qualities, which enter the ears of those who hear and remove their bodily
distress, and having also heard of Your beauty, which fulfills all the visual
desires of those who see, I have fixed my shameless mind upon You, O 
Kṛṣṇa
. [37]


 


2) O 
Mukunda
, You are equal only to 
Yourself
 in lineage, character, beauty, knowledge,
youthfulness, wealth and influence. O lion among men, 
You

delight the minds of all mankind. What aristocratic, sober-minded and
marriageable girl of a good family would not choose 
You

as her husband when the proper time has come? [38]


 


3) Therefore, my dear Lord, I have chosen 
You

as my husband, and I surrender myself to You. Please come swiftly, O almighty
one, and make me 
Your
 wife. My dear lotus-eyed Lord,
let 
Śiśupāla
 never touch the hero's
portion like a jackal stealing the property of a lion. [39]


 


4) If I have sufficiently worshiped the Supreme Personality of Godhead
by pious works, sacrifices, charity, rituals and vows, and also by worshiping
the demigods, 
brāhmaṇas
 and gurus, then
may 
Gadāgraja
 come and take my hand, and not 
Damaghoṣa's
 son or anyone else. [40]


 


5) O unconquerable one, tomorrow when my marriage ceremony is about to
begin, 
You
 should arrive unseen in 
Vidarbha

and surround Yourself with the leaders of Your army. Then crush the forces of 
Caidya
 and 
Magadhendra
 and marry
me in the 
Rākṣasa
 style, winning me with 
Your
 valor. [41]


 


6) Since I will be staying within the inner chambers of the palace, 
You
 may wonder, "How can I carry you away without
killing some of your relatives?" But I shall tell 
You

a way: On the day before the marriage there is a grand procession to honor the
royal family's deity, and in this procession the new bride goes outside the
city to visit Goddess 
Girijā
. [42]


 


7) O lotus-eyed one, great souls like Lord 
Śiva
 hanker to bathe in the dust of Your lotus
feet and thereby destroy their ignorance. If I cannot obtain 
Your

mercy, I shall simply give up my vital force, which will have become weak from
the severe penances I will perform. Then, after hundreds of lifetimes of
endeavor, I may obtain 
Your
 mercy. [43]
