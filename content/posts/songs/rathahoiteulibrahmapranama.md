TRANSLATION


1)
Brahma descended from the chariot, bowed down, and with folded hands offered
prayers.


 


2)
His four crowns touching the ground, and tears flowing from his eyes, weeping
Brahma sadly spoke the following words.


 


3)
O Lord, O master of Maya, I offer my respectful 
obeisances

unto 
You
. In the blinking of an eye 
You

can create many millions of Brahmas like me.


 


4)
Even though in these three worlds I am called by the name "the unborn
one" and by other respectful names, I am blind and foolish, for I could
not recognize who 
You
 really are.


 


5)
I was born from the lotus flower of 
Your
 navel.
Therefore I am not truly unborn. It is 
You
 who are
unborn, for You are 
Narayana
, the goddess of
fortune's husband.


 


6)
You are 
Narayana
, the beginning and end of
everything, the creator of all the universes.


 


7)
You are the master of the three modes: goodness, passion, and ignorance. You
are Lord 
Hari
, who created my body.


 


8)
Who can describe 
Your
 glories? Millions and millions
of Brahmas have come from the pores of 
Your

transcendental body. 


 


9)
I am one of those many millions of Brahmas. I am a lowly creature with a body
the size of seven cubits.


 


10)
With an eye blink 
You
 create many millions of Brahmas,
and with a glance You again destroy them.


 


11)
You are the creator of the universes. You are the beginning, middle, and end.
Are 
You
 not Lord 
Narayana
?


 


12)
How many pious deeds must one have performed in past lives to attain the
company of 
Your
 servants? O Lord, please don't
bewilder me with Your Maya. O 
Govinda
, please hear my
words.


 


13)
A child inside the mother's womb may sometimes kick the mother's body.


 


14)
Does the kicking infant commit a sin? O 
Damodara
,
please hear my words: Many millions of Brahmas reside within 
Your

transcendental body.


 


15)
Â“O Lord who holds the 
cakra
, why will 
You
 not be merciful to me?Â” Weeping and weeping, Brahma
spoke these words.


 


REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:


This is sung in Raga 
Lalita
.
