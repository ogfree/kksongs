TRANSLATION


1) The dead boy continued,
"Thus I have been captured and bound by 
maya
.
Due to being tied tightly by her ropes of ignorance and bewilderment, I have
undergone many, many births since that time, simply wandering here and there in
the ghastly darkness of 
maya's
 illusions."


 


2) "Sometime I become
a demigod, sometimes a demon, and sometimes I get the body of a man, an animal,
a bird or an insect. Sometimes I wander up to heaven, sometimes down to hell,
and sometimes on earth, being carried away the whole time by innumerable
materialistic hopes and aspirations."


 


3) " I have no idea of
what kind of wonderful pious credit I have earned to be born here in this life
as the son of Sri 
Srivasa
 
Pandita

within the holy abode of 
Navadvipa
. Thus I myself am
amazed that I have had the great fortune of actually being able to see and
touch 
Your
 lotus feet, oh Lord."


 


4) "Usually, whenever
I have to die, I always experience great pain and distress upon leaving the
particular body I happen to be in. But this time, I am only experiencing great
happiness by discussing all these topics related to 
Your

glories. However, my time is now up, so I must take 
Your

leave."


 


5) "If it is Your desire
that I should take another birth, oh Lord, I pray and humbly request Your
Lordship to kindly allow me to be always situated in the transcendental loving
service of Your divine lotus feet."


 


6) Saying this, the boy
then fell silent. Seeing this wonderful pastime of Sri 
Caitanya


Mahaprabhu
, 
Srivasa
 
Pandita's
 whole family gave up all of their lamentation and
became absorbed in great transcendental happiness.


 


7) Thus the transcendental
character and activities of Sri 
Caitanya
 
Mahaprabhu
 are just like a continuous shower of ambrosia. 
Bhaktivinoda
 is thereby losing his vital life force simply
begging 
Srivasa
 
Thakura
 to
allow him to drink more of this 
nectarean
 ambrosia.
