TRANSLATION


1) I forsook You, O Lord,
and came to this world of pain and sorrow. Now I submit my tale of woe at 
Your
 lotus feet.


 


2) While still in the
unbearable fetters of my motherÂ’s womb, I saw 
You

before me You revealed Yourself but briefly and then abandoned this poor
servant of Yours.


 


3) At that moment I swore
to worship 
You
 after taking birth; but birth came, and
with it the network of worldly illusion which robbed me of all good sense.


 


4) As a fondled son in the
lap of relatives, I passed my time smiling and laughing. My parentsÂ’ affection
helped me to forget the pangs of birth, and I thought the world was very nice.


 


5) Day by day I grew and
soon began playing with other boys. Shortly my powers of understanding emerged.
I read and studied my lessons incessantly.


 


6) Traveling from place to
place, proud of my education, I grew wealthy and maintained my family with
undivided attention. O Lord 
Hari
, I forgot 
You
!


 


7) Now in old age, 
Bhaktivinoda
 is sad. He weeps. I failed to worship You, O
Lord, and instead passed my life in vain. What will be my fate 
now.
