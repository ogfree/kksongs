TRANSLATION


1) One day a 
brahmana
 approached Lord 
Krsna
,
whose sweet pastimes in 
Vraja
 had ended, who was the
demons' enemy, and who, in His heart thinking of Himself as a king, had no
desire for marriage.


 


2) The 
brahmana
 recited a message from Princess 
Rukmini
, and Lord 
Krsna
 replied
with eloquent words sweet like nectar. The happy 
brahmana

returned to 
his own
 city and spoke to 
Rukmini
 the good news of Lord 
Krsna's

arrival there.


 


3) Bowing again and
again before the 
brahmana
, joyful 
Rukmini

desired that he become happy and prosperous. Yearning to attain Lord 
Krsna's
 feet, 
Rukmini
 worshiped
Goddess 
Parvati
.


 


4) Riding on a
chariot, Lord 
Krsna
 gloriously 
kidnaped


Rukmini
 as His enemies complained with unhappy faces.
Lord 
Krsna
 made 
Jarasandha

and His other enemies turn from the battle, and only 
Rukmi

was willing to fight with 
Krsna
, the crusher of the
demons.


 


5) Lord 
Krsna
 defeated 
Rukmi
, shaved his head,
and made him very odd-looking. Defeated by 
Krsna
, 
Rukmi
 and the kings returned to their own cities.
