TRANSLATION


1) My
dear mind, you have brought unending trouble upon yourself under the sway of
material sense gratification. Leaving the company of Radha-Syama in
Vraja-dhama, you have come to this material world and suffered a host of
painful miseries. 


 


2)
Trapped within the prison-house of Maya-Devi, and tossed helplessly according
to the urges of your past karma, your life has come to an end after slaving and
slaving away at very difficult and mundane labor. Absorbed in the material
body, thinking in terms of "I" and "mine," you experience
only attraction and repulsion for dull material things. 


 


3) You
are actually composed of spiritually conscious bliss, whose only happiness is
found in Krsna-seva. Alas, you have fallen into the hands of the five material
elements (earth, water, fire, air, and ether), and have thus become just like
an ignorant sheep who is helpless within their firm grip. But now your ultimate
means of deliverance is to be found in the company of sadhus, discussing topics
of the eternally conscious nature. 


 


4) The
association of materialistic women, as well as endeavors for accumulating
wealth for the purpose of sense gratification -- O my dear brother! Give up
such insignificant play! Please accept the pure advice of Cand Baul: Rejecting
all deceptive tendencies that are associated with the sects of impure Bauls,
just enter the flow of pure, spiritual mellows of devotion.
