TRANSLATION


The 1st Verse


(The Objects of Devotion
Birth After Birth)


 


No matter whenever and
wherever I happen to take birth, let my loving affection and attachment remain
anshaken throughout each and every lifetime for the following things: 


for my divine spiritual
master, 

for Sri Gauranga, 

for the detailed topics of pure devotional service  (and the methods of
its execution) as personally instructed by Him, 

for the holy places of pilgrimage such as Sri Navadvipa, Sri Ksetra, Sri
Vrndavana, etc. , which are all blooming with divine sanctity due to His
performance of wonderful pastimes therein, 

for the diksa mantra bestowed upon me by the divine grace of my spiritual
master, 

for the holy name of Sri Hari, 

for the most beloved eternal associates of the Lord, 

for the sacred days of celebration throughout the year such as Sri Ekadasi, Sri
Janmastami, Sri Radhastami, and the appearance/disappearance days of the great
Vaisnava acaryas etc. , 

for the Lord's dearmost devotees who strictly follow in the sacred footsteps of
Srila Rupa Gosvami, 

and for the holy scriptures narrated by Srila Sukadeva Gosvami such as the
Srimad Bhagavatam, etc. 


 


The 2nd Verse


(The Internal Identity of
Lord Caitanya, the Eternal Guide)


 


The Supreme Lord Sri Krsna
is the personified abode of all divinely ecstatic mellow-tastes. And Sri
Radhika is the topmost abode of all His divinely potent energies. Indeed, She
is the personified form of the highest mellow of love in separation. Within the
forest of Vrnda, which is gloriously rich in the all-pervading treasure of the
sweetest madhura-rasa, this Lord Sri Krsna is continuously enjoying as He makes
Sri Radhika happy by His loving service rendered to Her 24 hours a day. This
very same Lord Krsna is exactly identical to the Son of mother Saci Who
eternally lives simultaneously yet separately in Gauda-desa as the Instructor
of the process for rendering His own service. May this Saci- nanadana become my
Supreme Master and Guide, and may He always appear to me just to lead me on the
proper devotional path birth after birth after birdh. 


 


The 3rd Verse


(Rejection of Things
Unfavorable for Sri Radha-Krishna's Eternal Service)


 


Let no form of so-called renunciation
or asceticism become fit for my acceptance if it does not give rise to the
continual expansion of my eternal serving mood of loving devotion. And let no
form of so-called knwoledge or intellectual cultivation appeal to me at all if
it does not admit the reality of eternal individuality shared by the Lord and
His devotees during their everlasting daily pastimes. I have no desire at all
for practicing any branch of the eight-fold yoga process, for none of them
contain any scope for enjoying the daily plasure of serving Lord Hari such as
His confidential worship does. Rather, may I render profuse, uninterrupted
confidential service 24 hours a day to Sri Sri Radha-Krsna for all of time to
come (such service being the means as well as the end) . 


 


The 4th Verse


(Where to Live, and Where
Not to Live)


 


May I continuously reside
in a small, lonely cottage at the base of a desire-tree in the most holy abode
of Sri Navadvipa-dhama, which is sanctified by the lotus feet of Sri
Saci-Nanadana. Such a bhajan-kutir is perfectly suitble for constant
remembrance of, and service to the divine daily sports that are always present
in Sri Vraja-dhama. Indeed, in contrast to this, I will never live in any other
place, even if it is bankered for with great enthusiasm by the most wise sages
and demigods of all sorts. As far as all other places in this world are
concerned, whether opulent palaces or temples, whether possessing vast riches
of enormous wealth or princely kingdoms and property ----- all such places
cannot attract me as much as my modest bhajan-kutir in Sri Navadvipa-dhama
does. 


 


The 5th Verse


(The Real Principle of
Dharma Which Is Devoid of Designations)


 


I have no attachment at all
to any of those caste divisions of society such as brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya
or sudra. And I certainly do not identify with any order of life such as
brahmacarya, grhasta, vanaprasta, or sannyasa. I have no fondness or respect at
all for the so-called piety of religiosity or even for the so-called impiety of
sinful life in this world-----not even the slightest regard. Instead , I truly
desire whathever is practically required just to maintain this material body in
order to facilitate my performance of pure devotional service. This is the
actual righteousness that I will hope for as long as this material body
continues to exist. 


 


The 6th Verse


(Favorable, Authorized
Practices and Devotional Qualities)


 


My austere vow is costant
devotion to the lotus feet of Sri Hari. In order to execute that vow, I have
accepted the following qualities by my own endeavor: 


I practice great humility
in my dealings with everyone; 

I try to keep simplicity and purity prominent in all of my practical
arrangements: 

I maintain extreme tolerance in all types of favoreble or unfavorable
circumstances: 

I offer all respect unto others, regardless of who they are: 

I feel genuine compassion for all living entities and act accordingly 


There are many
transcendental activities which are recommended by the great devotees who are
fixed-up in unalloyed devotional service to the lotus feet of
Sriman-Mahaprabhu, and these can be found described in the books that are full
of the imperishable character and pastimes of Mahaprabhu Sri Krsna Caitanya.
Only such transcendentally nectarean activities, being recommended by great
devotees and practiced by Lord Caitanya Himself, are indeed my own. 


 


The 7th Verse


(Repulsion from Those
Things Which Are Disconnected from Sri Radhika)


 


I have no attraction for
living in Vaikuntha, that part of the spiritual sky presided over by Sri Sri
Laksmi- Narayana; nor do I desire useless activities of gross sense
gratification in this material world. I will never cherish the desire for
attaining the divine bliss of impersonalistic liberation, even for a second.
Furthermore, there are many transcendental pastimes of Sri Hari that may be
very purifying for all conditioned souls -- yet such pastimes will never ever
give me any real happiness at all. This is because such pastimes are quite
different from blissful ecstasies of Vraja-consciousness, being complitely
devoid of any relationship with Sri-Radhika, Who is the one and and only
fountainhead of pure joy. 


 


The 8th Verse


(Renunciation of All Kinds
of Bad Association)


 


I now disown my wife, my
daughters, my sons, my mother, and all my friends, If they have no genuine
attachment for Lord Hari, for His devotees, or for His devotional service. It
is definitely a great sin even to accept foodgrains prepared by such
non-devotional, materialistic sense-gratifiers. If I were to remain in the
company of such persons, then how will the eternal perfection of my Hari-bajan
ever come about? 


 


The 9th Verse


(Avoidance of So-Called
'Devotees' Who Proudly Neglect Sri Radhika)


 


There are certain persons who
appear to very advanced in devotion. Indeed, to increase their service to the
Lord, they have long since rejected the evil company of: 


those who are completely
blinded by faulty arguments arising from so-called intellectual logic, 

those who are madly addicted to the fleeting pleasures of the dull material
body, 

those who are averse to and envious of Lord Sri Krsna, 

and those who are very fond of the inferior, distasteful concept of liberation
as it is cherished by the impersonalists. 


They have thus favorably
avoided all kinds of bad association; yet it is seen that such persons worship
Lord Govinda without Srimati Radarani being present. This just shows that they
are actually puffed-up with excessive pride and conceited arrogance directed
against Sri Radika, who is Herself the best worshipper of Govinda. Therefore I
will never ever go anywhere near such so-called devotees ----- even for a
second. This is my strict vow. 


 


The 10th Verse


(How to Live Simply and
Perform Vraja-Bhajana Until Death)


 


Passing my life in a
simple, practical way---- 


eating only prasada
foodgrains and milk products, the remnants of the Supreme, Lord, His mercy, 

wearing only prasad cloth that was offered to the Deity, 

using only the pots and utensils sanctified by the Lord's exclusive service, 

I will thus remain completely aloof from material sense-gratification. 


Living by the side of Sri
Radha-kunda (Her very own abode), worshiping the Divine Couple with a blissful
mind, the time will come for my to die. At the soles of the devotees's lotus
feet, who are themselves serving the lotus feet of the Divine Couple, I will
thus give up my body. 


 


The 11th Verse


(How to Worship the Lotus
Feet of Sri Radhika's Pure Devotee)


 


There is a class of pure
devotee who is completely expert and experienced in following all the
instruction of Sri Saci-nandana. Such a devotee incessantly worships Srimati
Radharani exlusively, Who is indeed the most worshipable Personality, and who
is deeply absorbed every day in relishing the Divine mellows of Sri Krsna's
association.The pure devotee of this calibre definitely performs his
confidential worship whole-heartedly and with exclusive surrender unto Sri
Radhika. Thus he always lives in Sri Vraja-mandala. I shall take the nectarean
water that has washed the lotus feet of such a devotee and carry it on my head.
Drinking it with great joy, and with a devout heart, I will then happily offer
my full prostration upon the ground in the nicest, most perfect way that I
possibly can. This will indeed be my routine each and every day. 


 


The 12th Verse


(Firm Determination to
Transcend Maya by Daily Following This Stava)


 


As a spirit soul, my
natural tendency is to be eternally situated in the loving devotional service
of Lord Hari; however, due to the strong power and influence of the Lord's
maha-maya, I have somehow plunged deeply into the fathomless ocean of material
sorrow and grief. I shall transcend this world of maya and go to the spiritual
world only by faithfully following these self imposed vows every day. And the
only way Iwill get the strength to follow these vows is by attaining the mercy
of all the Vaisnava devotees of the Lord. May their causeless mercy and
softhearted compassion, which wards off all illusion, become my exclusive
friend and guide for all of time everlasting. 


 


The 13th Verse


(Phal-Sruti-the Benediction
of Eternal Service Gained by Reading This Stava) 


 


This stava named Sva-niyam
Dvadasakam was written by someone to adjust and regulate his own personal mode
of performing bhajan. If any other devotee happens to chant this stava with a
very special quality of resolute faith, fully offering his mind unto: 


the supreme beautiful forms
of the Divine Couple, Sri Sri Radha-Govinda, his most dear possession, 

or to the Divine beauty of Their Deity form, 

or to the beauty or Sri Gaura-Sundara, the combined form of Sri Sri
Radha-Govinda, 

or to Srila Rupa Gosvami, the dearmost beloved devotee of Sri Sri Radha-Govinda
and Sri Gaura-Sundara, 


then that fortunate reader
definitely attains his own place of eternal residence in Sri Vraja-dhama.
Always following behind his own manjari-guru, in his own spiritual body of a
manjari, he finally renders all kinds of variegated eternal services for the
exclusive worship of Sri Sri Radha-Krsna.
