TRANSLATION


1)
With the edge of her garment a beautiful 
gopi
 gets
shy and covers her face. She has become like a greedy bumblebee or a 
cakora
 bird. Yearning and yearning, she walks.


 


2)
Is the half-covered circle of her face really an autumn lotus? Is her forehead
a moon on the eighth night? She enchants 
Krsna's

heart. Now He is bewildered. What does 
Krsna
 think
now?


 


3)
The palm of her hand eclipses the land-growing lotus. The moons of her
fingernails enchant and bewilder 
Krsna
. Now He is
overcome.


 


4)
She bends the archer's bow of her eyebrows. An arrow is fired. Now 
Krsna
 trembles. Did 
Kamadeva's

arrow strike 
Krsna's
 head? 
Govinda


dasa
 says: Lord 
Krsna's

heart is now consumed by flames.
