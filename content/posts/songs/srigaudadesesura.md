TRANSLATION


1)
I remember Sri 
Navadvipa-dhama
, the eternal and
blissful land which is splendidly situated on the charming banks of the holy 
Bhagirathi
 
River
 in Sri 
Gaua-desa
.


 


2)
I remember Sri 
Navadvipa-dhama
, which some say is 
VaikuNÂ†ha
 and others say is 
Goloka
,
but those who have realized the truth know it as 
Vrndavana
.


 


3)
I remember Sri 
Navadvipa-dhama
, the land which
illuminates all directions. Attractive with its gentle, cooling breezes and
various beautiful trees, it provides Sri 
Gaurasundara

with a wonderful facility to perform His 
midday
 
sankirtana
 pastimes.


 


4)
I remember Sri 
Navadvipa-dhama
, where with her many
waves the 
Bhagirathi
 joyfully flows, and where steps
composed of gold decorate the river banks.


 


5)
I remember Sri 
Navadvipa-dhama
, where countless
golden palaces are splendidly situated and where 
Laksmidevi

resides in each and every home.


 


6)
I remember Sri 
Navadvipa-dhama
, where the residents
are adorned with all good qualities such as knowledge, compassion, forgiveness,
and sacrifice, and are praised even by the sages, demigods, and perfected
souls.


 


7)
I remember Sri 
Navadvipa-dhama
, where Sri 
Gaurasundara
 performed pastimes such as taking birth and
where the blissful home of Sri 
Jagannatha
 
Misra
 is situated.


 


8)
I remember Sri 
Navadvipa-dhama
, where Sri 
Gaurahari
 and His devotees wandered here and there
performing 
sankirtana
 which was so full of 
prema
 that it immersed everyone in an ocean of 
ujjvalabhava
.


 


9)
Those who joyfully recite these eight verses of poetry, which bring remembrance
of 
Navadvipa
 
dhama
, will
obtain that rare love for the lotus feet of Sri 
SacI-nandana


Gaurahari
.
