TRANSLATION


(Refrain)
Our Lord Gaura came chanting "Hari! Hari!"


 


1)
Lord Gauranga-canda came looking very disheveled, as if mad, due to ecstatic
love of God, and along with Lord Nityananda and Advaita Acarya, He entered the land of Godruma.


 


2)
Deeply absorbed in the intoxicating mellows of sankirtan, He distributed the
holy name. Having come to the Marketplace of the Holy Name, He caused the whole
universe to swim in ecstatic love of God.


 


3)
Today all the miseries of the residents of Godruma-dvipa have gone far away,
for Lord Gauranga, having come here along with all His devotees, caused the
Marketplace of the Holy Name to appear here in Godruma.


 


4)
Wandering all over the land of Nadiya, Lord Gaura came to the Marketplace of
the Holy Name. Lord Gaura came to the Marketplace along with Nitai.


 


5)
Maddened with ecstasy, Lord Nityananda dances in the fields of Godruma. Due to
ecstatic love of God, He moves His powerful arms like a challenging wrestler
and thus overwhelms the universe in ecstasy.


 


6)
(Oh, all of you please go and see!) The Vaisnavas headed by Advaita Acarya are
dancing along the banks of the Ganga from one bathing ghat to the next! At such
a sight as this, the wicked personality Kali falls into great danger and thus
runs for his life.


 


7) In
what indescribable happiness did all living beings swim while Lord Gauracandra
was dancing? By seeing and hearing of such pastimes, the hearts of the atheists
break.
