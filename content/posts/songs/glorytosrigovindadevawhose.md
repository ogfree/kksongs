LYRICS:


(1)


Glory
to Sri Govindadeva whose feet


Are
like two lotus flowers and whose waist


Is
like a pond by lotus flowers embraced,


And
whose navel is like a lotus flower sweet


 


(2)


With
fragrance and whose dark broad glorious chest


Is
like a lotus forest great and whose arms


Are
like lotus stems and whose graceful neck is like charms


Made
of lotus flowers and in whose fingers rest


 


(3)


A host
of lotus petals and whose smile


Is the
fragrance of lotus flowers and whose face


Is a
million petal lotus flower with grace


And
glory and divine sweet nectar while


 


(4)


His
glistening restless playful smiling eyes


Are of
blue lotus flowers the graceful prize.
