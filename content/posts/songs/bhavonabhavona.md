TRANSLATION


1) My
dear mind, you have not thought of this! You have not thought of this! You are
very wicked! (Oh, you are deeply sunk in the poison of worldly sense
gratification!) You are overwhelmed by lust, anger, greed, illusion, madness,
and so on! (Oh, you are under the sway of the enemy!)


 


2) You
are attracted by a thirst for hearing mundane news, enjoying material sense
objects, and seeking liberation! (Oh, you think that nonsensical talk sounds
very pleasant!) You have become crushed by the desire for fame, as well as by
hypocrisy and crooked dealings! (Oh, you are not very simple or
straightforward!) You are completely surrounded, dear brother, by all these
inauspicious signs of death! (Oh, these are indeed your deadly enemies!)


 


3) If
you do not give up all these things, then how will you attain Radha and Krsna?
(Oh, carefully abandon, just abandon them!) Other than the association of
sadhus, where else is your real benefit to be found? (Oh, just keep the
company, keep the company of saintly devotees!) Just immerse yourself in the
lotus feet of a Vaisnava, and all unwanted things will disappear! (Oh, just
think about all of this for once and see for yourself!)
