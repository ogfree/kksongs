TRANSLATION


1) O 
Krsna
,
moving along the bank of the 
Ymauna
 
river
, You went to the shore of the 
Kaliya

lake. With Your 
nectarean
 glance, 
You

restored the life of the cowherd boys and calves who had died because of 
Kaliya's
 poison. O Lord, I offer respectful 
obeisances
 unto 
You
.


 


2) O 
Krsna
,
the cowherd boys could guess that 
You
 had restored
their lives and they became amazed. In order to protect 
Your

own devotees, You manifested Your transcendental prowess, which had previously
been concealed. O Lord, all glories unto 
You
.
