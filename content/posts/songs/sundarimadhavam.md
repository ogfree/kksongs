TRANSLATION


Refrain:
O beautiful one, please gaze upon Lord 
Madhava
, whose
transcendental form and flower garland both move in the jeweled swing pushed by
the hands of 
Your
 friends.


 


1)
The sweetness of His pastimes fills all His cowherd relatives and friends. His chest
is anointed with sandal 
kunkuma
. His form is splendid
as a 
tamala
 tree. 


 


2)
His forehead is splendidly decorated with 
gorocana
 
tilaka
 drawn by the doe-eyed girls of 
Vraja
.
The young 
gopis
 are enchanted by the moonlight of His
face and overwhelmed with amorous longings created by His smile. 


 


3)
He is expert in joking. He is decorated with many flowers. He is charming. His
chest is broad. He destroys the fears of the surrendered devotees. He is the
dear, eternal swan that plays in the 
Manasa
 Lake that
is the hearts of the 
Vrajavasis
.


 


REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:


This song is to be sung in Raga 
Basanta
.
