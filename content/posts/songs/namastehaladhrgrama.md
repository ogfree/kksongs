Obeisances to You, O holder of the plow. Obeisances to You, O wielder of the
mace.  Obeisances to You, O darling of Revati.  Obeisances to You, O
kind benefactor of Your devotees.


 


2) Obeisances
to You, O best of the strong. Obeisances to You, O upholder of the earth! Obeisances
to You, O enemy of Pralamba.  Please protect me, older brother of Krsna.
