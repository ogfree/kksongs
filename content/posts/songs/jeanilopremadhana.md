WORD
FOR WORD TRANSLATION: 
Je Anilo Prema Dhana
Koruna Pracura


 


TRANSLATION



1) He,
who brought the treasure of divine love and who was filled with compassion and
mercy--where has such a personality as Advaita Acarya gone? 


 


2)
Where are my Svarupa Damodara and Rupa Gosvami? Where is Sanatana? Where is
Raghunatha Dasa, the savior of the fallen? 


 


3)
Where are my Raghunatha Bhatta and Gopala Bhatta, and where is Krsnadasa
Kaviraja? Where did Lord Gauranga, the great dancer, suddenly go? 


 


4) I
will smash my head against the rock and enter into the fire. Where will I find
Lord Gauranga, the reservoir of all wonderful qualities? 


 


5)
Being unable to obtain the association of Lord Gauranga accompanied by all of these
devotees in whose association He performed His pastimes, Narottama Dasa simply
weeps.
