TRANSLATION


Refrain: Friend, in a dream
last night I saw 
Mukunda
 decorated with a garland of
jasmine flowers.


 


1) He had returned to 
Gokula
 from the king's city. He made His mother and father
mad with happiness. 


 


2) He inspired a tumultuous
festival. His glance brought 
Me
 great happiness.


 


3) He was very handsome
with a fresh 
gunja
 necklace. He was filled with love
for His eternal friends.
