TRANSLATION


1)
The glories of the Lord's daily pastimes: Devotional service to the lotus feet
of Sri Gauranga Mahaprabhu is far beyond the perception of Lord Brahma, Lord
Siva, Lord Sesa-naga and the rest; but it is continually indulged in by the
Lord's own devotees, and it is always available to other souls as well. Now I
will begin my description of the process of manasi-seva (service to the Lord
executed within the mind). This process is fit for continuous remembrance by
the most virtuous sages. Therefore I offer my most respectful obeisances to the
eternal daily life and pastimes of the Lord born in Navadvipa.


 


2)
Brief description of his daily schedule: At the end of night (before sunrise),
Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu gets up from His bed, stretches His body, talks
with His wife and washes His face; (2) in the morning, He is massaged with oil
and bathes in the celestial Ganges river, then worships Lord Visnu; (3) in the
forenoon period, He enjoys discussing topics about Lord Krsna with His devotees
during visits to their homes; (4) at midday, He enjoys pastimes in the gardens
on the bank of the Ganges; (5) in the afternoon, He wanders about the town of
Navadvipa, sporting with all the residents; (6) at dusk, he returns home to
worship Lord Visnu and perform other rituals; (7) in the evening, He goes with
His associates to the courtyard of Srivasa Pandita to chant the holy names and
dance in ecstasy; (8) and at night, He returns home to go to sleep. May this
Lord Gaura protect us all.


 


3)
Period 1: pastimes at the end of the night: At the end of the night, upon
hearing the pleasant sounds made by many birds such as the cuckoos, roosters,
and others, Sri Gaura arises from His bed. With His wife, Sri Visnu Priya, He
discusses many topics concerning the transcendental mellows of Their mutual
loving affairs, and thus They become very pleased. Then He gets up and goes to
another room, wherein He sits upon a raised sitting place and is assisted by His
devotees in washing His lotus face with nicely scented water. Thereafter, He
very happily visits His mother, Sri Saci Devi, as well as other friends and
relatives in the home. I meditate thus on the daily pastimes of Sri
Gaura-sundara.


 


4)
Period 2: morning pastimes: In the morning, after sunrise, the Lord goes with
His associates to bathe in the Ganges river. While bathing, they also worship
mother Ganges by offering flowers, incense and other presentations. After this,
they come onto the bank of the river, where He is dressed with exquisite cloth
and decorated with fresh flower garlands, sandalwood paste and other ornaments.
Then they all return to His home in order to perform opulent worship of Lord Visnu
as well as other rituals, after which they partake of the foods which were
offered to Lord Visnu. After washing His hands and mouth, Lord Gaura goes into
another room to rest very happily for awhile. I meditate thus on the daily
pastimes of Sri Gaura-hari.


 


5)
Period 3: forenoon pastimes: Upon the arrival of the forenoon period the Lord
gets up from His nap and stretches His body. Then he washes His lotus face with
sweetly scented water. Meeting with His devotees who are all very fond of
chanting Sri Hari-nama-kirtana, He personally tastes and relishes the chanting
of the holy names. Thus He sports, sometimes in the homes of various devotees
and sometimes in His own home. It this way He increases the ecstatic pleasure
of all the people of Navadwip to limitless heights. I meditate thus on the
daily pastimes of Sri Gaura-candra.


 


6)
Period 4: midday pastimes: During the midday period, Lord Caitanya continues to
enjoy the performance of intensely enthusiastic chanting and dancing,
surrounded by His own dear devotees such as the moon-like Advaita Acarya,
Gadadhara Pandita, and the divine madman Srila Nityananda Prabhu. Afterwards,
they all wander throughout the gardens and groves on the bank of the Ganges,
where they enjoy the sweet cooling breezes from the river. Hearing the pleasant
sounds of the bumblebees in those gardens, the Lord remembers His own ecstatic
pastimes of Radha and Krsna as they are occurring simultaneously in His own
forest of Vrndavana. I meditate thus on the daily pastimes of Sri Gauranga.


 


7)
Period 5: afternoon pastimes: During the splendidly beautiful afternoon period,
the Lord and His devotees become equally maddened in ecstatic love, and being
ornamented like this, they expand every-increasing ripples of auspicious
benefit for all the three worlds. In this mood, they leave the gardens and
travel back toward His home. On the way, they satisfy the eyes of all the
townspeople, just as the moon satisfies the cakora bird with its moonbeams.
Reaching home, the Lord is lavished with loving attentions by His mother. I
thus meditate on the daily pastimes of Gaura.


 


8)
Period 6: sunset pastimes: At dusk, the Lord bathes with His dear friends in
the river Ganges, who flows in three parts. They devoutly worship the Ganges by
offering ghee lamps, flowers, and other articles. Afterwards, the Lord puts on
fresh silken clothes and is adorned with flower garlands and other decorations.
Then, He worships Lord Visnu by performing the evening arati ceremony, offering
ghee lamps and other articles. Afterwards, He and His friends partake of the
foodstuffs and betel nuts that were offered to Lord Visnu. I thus meditate on
the daily pastimes of Lord Gaurasundara.


 


9)
Period 7: evening pastimes: In the evening time, the Lord goes to the home of
Srivasa Pandita, accompanied by Srila Advaita-candra and other dear associates.
Meeting with the multitude of devotees, He tastes and relishes the nectar of
topics concerning Lord Hari and His mind becomes most agitated with the
ecstasies of pure love of Godhead. Then, becoming very eager to relish the
congregational chanting of the holy names of the Lord, He orchestrates the
performance of intensely jubilant sankirtana which attains the summit of
passionate glorification of the holy names. I thus meditate on the daily
pastimes of Sri Gaura-sundara.


 


10)
Period 8: midnight pastimes: Continuing well into the night, the Lord dances
and dances in the courtyard of Srivasa, surrounded by His most intimate
devotees. His most ecstatic singing is accompanied by His devotees who are
expert in playing rhythms loudly on the mridanga drums. He wanders and dances
with Sri Gadadhara Prabhu in the most astonishing way, througout the night,
until just before dawn. Then He returns to His own home, where He retires to
His bedchamber and falls asleep with His beautiful consort. I thus meditate on
the daily pastimes of Sri Gaura-nataraja.


 


11)
The benefit of reciting this prayer: Sri Gauranga, the Moon over Navadvipa, is
manifest in His own abode during eight periods of each day and every day. His
pastimes should be remembered by meditative devotees before they remember the
pastimes of Sri Krsna, the Moon over Gokula. If someone lovingly reads or
recites the Lord's eternal daily pastimes as they are illuminated in the ten
verses of this prayer, then the Lord is immensely pleased with that person, by
His own merciful compassion. I thus meditate on the daily pastimes of Sri
Gaurachandra.
