TRANSLATION


1) On
His mouth is a smile. In that smile is nectar. In that nectar is a flute, and
in that flute is a nectar ocean of music. Gopinatha plunges the gopis in the
waves of that ocean. Broad chested Gopinatha is the goal of our lives.


 


2)
With the movement of the peacock feather in His red crown splendid with pearls
and peacock feathers, He robs the jewels of the activities of our hearts and
eyes. Broad-chested Gopinatha is the goal of our lives.


 


3) The
splendor of His broad thighs embraces His yellow dhoti. Glistening bells
decorate His hips. A gopi kisses His left shoulder. Broad-chested Gopinatha is
the goal of our lives.


 


4) He
wears yellow garments. Necklaces of flowers, gold, jewels, pearls, and gunja
decorate His neck. Broad-chested Gopinatha is the goal of our lives.


 


5) He
wears a white crown, white ornaments, and two or three splendid white garlands.
His fame and purity are splendid and white. At the auspicious morning and
evening aratis He kisses our heart. Broad-chested Gopinatha is the goal of our
lives.


 


6) He
is handsome. He is decorated with the four marks of srivatsa, sri, kaustubha,
and hairs standing erect in ecstasy. The fortunate devotees gaze on Him with
pure love. Broad-chested Gopinatha is the goal of our lives.


 


7) Is
He a dark tamala tree surrounded by a golden vine? Is He a dark cloud with
blazing lightning at both His sides, or is He a dark moon in the midst of two
radha-stars? Broad-chested Gopinatha is the goal of our lives.


 


8) He
is a personified Ganges of pure love. He shows mercy to the poor and the
shelterless and nourishes them with the nectar remnants of His meals, which cannot
be attained even by the demigods. Broad-chested Gopinatha is the goal of our
lives.


 


9)
Gopinatha does not see millions of sins of one who, carefully nourishing love
for His lotus feet, reads this Gopinathastaka with a happy heart. Broad-chested
Gopinatha is the goal of our lives.
