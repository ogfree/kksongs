TRANSLATION


1)
The presiding deity of devotional faith called 
Sraddha


Devi
, and she has two principle characteristics...
one is executed according to rules, and the other according to tastes. First of
all, when devotional faith arises due to fear of the rules and regulations
given in the revealed scriptures, then that type of faith is known throughout
the Vedas as "
vaidhi
 
sraddha
",
or faith situated in regulation.


Â 


2)
Secondly, sometimes one's faith flourishes in a similar way as that of the
residents of 
Vraja
, who all render service to Krsna
with a purely spontaneous service attitude. Faith that concentrates on Krsna
exclusively with such intense greed to satisfy Him is the 
chastest

form of faith. Such a pure, spontaneous service attitude is called "
raganuga
 
sraddha
", and a
practicing devotee who worships in this way attains the most auspicious
spiritual position.


 


3)
Due to different types of faith, these different divisions of devotional
service exist. Thus the four Vedas sing of these two types of devotion... regulative
service and spontaneous service. According to these different types of 
sadhana
, one accordingly attains different perfections,
which are all mentioned comprehensively in the revealed scriptures of
devotional service.


 


4)

Vaidhi
 
bhakti
 progresses
very slowly toward the goal, but 
raganuga
 
bhakti
 moves extremely fast, and enables one to be quickly
situated in the tasty transcendental mellows. By following the path of
spontaneous devotional service, real taste awakens in one's mind, and he runs
and chases after that current which flows from the lotus feet of 
Srila
 
Rupa
 
Gosvami
.
