TRANSLATION


1) 
O Lord Krsna, the naturally affectionate
and gentle women of 
Mathura
 lamented (when they saw
You fighting with 
Canura
). The women criticized the
entire assembly (for tolerating the unfair match of the tender young Krsna,
with the powerful 
Canura
), and everyone became very
embarrassed.


 


2) O Lord Krsna, You became pleased when the women of 
Mathura
 sang this glorification of the 
gopis

of 
Vraja
. Understanding the sufferings of 
Your
 father and mother, You quickly killed 
Canura
. O Lord, all glories unto 
You
.


 


3) O Lord 
krsna
, when 
You
 killed 
Sala
, and 
Tosala
, and Lord 
Balarama
 killed 
Mustika
 and 
Kutaka
, all the other
wrestlers fled from the arena.


 


4) 
O Lord Krsna, You became very angry,
hearing the demoniac words of 
Kamsa
 from the high
dais. When 
Kamsa
 moved his sword and shield (to kill 
You
), You violently grasped his hair.


 


5) 
O Lord Krsna, You threw 
Kamsa
,
King of the 
Bhojas
, to the ground, and jumped up on
his back. O enemy of 
Kamsa
, O Killer of 
Kamsa
, all glories unto 
You
.


 


6) O Lord Krsna, You killed 
Kamsa
 who
was like a sharp thorn causing pain to the entire world, and in this way 
You
 removed the fears and sufferings of the earth. To
satisfy 
Your
 father and mother and reassure them that
the demon was actually dead, You dragged the dead body of 
Kamsa
.


 


7) O Lord Krsna, when 
You
 killed 
Kamsa
, who was formerly known as 
Kalanemi-daitya
,
You caused Lord Brahma, Lord Siva and all the demigods to rejoice. Lord 
Balarama
 then killed 
Kamsa's

eight demoniac brothers. O Lord, please protect me.
