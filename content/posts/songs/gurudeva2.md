TRANSLATION


1)
Gurudeva! O spiritual master! When, with a steady mind in a secluded place,
will I sing the name of Sri Krsna? When will the pandemonium of worldly
existence no longer echo in my ears and the diseases of the body remain far
away? When will that day be mine?


 


2)
When I chant Â“Hare KrsnaÂ”, tears of love will flow from my eyes and ecstatic
rapture will arise within my body, causing my hair to stand on end and my body
to become overwhelmed with divine love.


 


3)
Faltering words choked with emotion will issue from my mouth. My body will
tremble, constantly perspire, turn pale and discolored, and become stunned. All
of this will be like a devastation of ecstatic love and cause me to fall
unconscious.


 


4)
When will such a genuine ecstatic condition be mine? I will constantly sing the
holy name and remain absorbed in profound devotion while maintaining the
material body. In this way I will obtain your mercy.
