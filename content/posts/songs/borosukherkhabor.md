WORD FOR WORD TRANSLATION: 
Boro Sukher Khabor
Gai


 


TRANSLATION


1) I
am singing news of great happy tidings. Lord Nityananda Himself has opened a
market-place of the Holy Name in Surabhi-Kunja.


 


2) The
news of its great results is that He is selling the pure Holy Name in that
market-place for the price of only one's faith.


 


3)
Lord Nityananda, the proprietor of the market, seeing all the devotees become
attracted, is selling them the Holy Name after bargaining with them.


 


4) O
brother, if you want to buy the Holy Name, then go with me. We must go to the
presence of that great soul, Nityananda.


 


5) You
will buy the name of Krsna, I will take my commission and all of our desires
will be fulfilled.


 


6)
Lord Nityananda is greatly merciful. Taking only one's faith, He gives the
highest ecstasy.


 


7) If
Nitai sees only once tears in the eyes while chanting the name
"Gaura", then He gives all resources to that person.


 


8) He
gives the pure teachings of Krsna to everyone and does not care for one's
birth, wealth, knowledge and strength.


 


9)
Now, giving up the illusory snare of Maya, either remain in household life or
in the forest as a sannyasi for no more troubles remain.


 


10)
There is no more fear of the age of Kali. The merciful Nityananda gives the
Holy Name to even the candalas.


 


11)
Bhaktivinoda calls out "Except for the lotus feet of Lord Nityananda there
is no other shelter!"
