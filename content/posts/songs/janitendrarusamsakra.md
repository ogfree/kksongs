TRANSLATION


1) O Lord Krsna, when You
angered Lord Indra in this way, he proudly inundated Vrndavana with devestating
rainfall. You checked that rain by lifting Govardhana Hill. O amazing powerful
Lord, I offer respectful obeisances unto You.


 


2) O Lord Krsna, You
playfully lifted Govardhana Hill in order to protect the residents of
Vrajabhumi. Placed upon Your hand, that unlimited mountain appeared as large as
the entire earth.


 


3) O greatly powerful Lord
Krsna, for seven days, You held up Govardhana Hill, the king of the mountains
if it were an umbrella and Your arm was it's handle. In this way You broke the
pride of Indra, who rides on the clouds.


 


4) O Lord Krsna, all
glories unto You. Staying under Govardhana Hill for seven days, You dispelled
the hunger and thirst of the residents of Vraja with Your (merciful) glance.
You broke the determined will of Lord Indra, and forced the great rainfall to stop.


 


5) O Lord krsna, You placed
Govardhana Hill back in it's own spot, and the gopis worshipped You by offering
yogurt and rice to You. The demigods showered sumana flowers, and Lord Indra
became greatly afraid.
