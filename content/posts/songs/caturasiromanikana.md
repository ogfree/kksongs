TRANSLATION


(Refrain) Glancing at the 
Yamuna's
 waters, Lord 
Krsna
, the
jewel of the wise, filled His flute with music. Now He was wild with 
Kamadeva's
 desires.


 


1) How many games did the
king of dancers play and play with His 
gopa
 friends?
Then, pushed by a certain desire, He left the boys' company and walked alone on
the forest path.


 


2) With that flute-music He
created a boat, a boat made of jewels, pearls, and coral, a boat with decks
made of diamonds, a boat with seat after seat made of gold and jewels, a boat
with many small bells that jangled as it moved.


 


3) Lord 
Krsna
,
the wise king of heroes, entered that boat and set out from the 
Yamuna's
 banks. 
Govinda
 
dasa
 says: As the boat moved, its many small bells
jangled.

REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:


This
is sung in Raga
