(Refrain) Alas! Alas! A
javelin is plunged in my chest! Why does the king of the 
rasikas

now weep in the midst of the holy chanting in 
sankirtana
?
I do not understand. My heart is filled with pain.


 


1) Why does He whose
handsomeness defeats millions of 
Kamadevas
, who is
the crest jewel of the wise and playful, who enjoys blissful pastimes in 
Goloka
, who is 
NandaÂ’s
 son, and
who is the 
gopis
Â’ life-treasure now roll about on the
ground?


 


2) Formerly He enjoyed many
pastimes with 
Radharani
, 
Candravali
,
and how many hundreds of teenage 
vraja-gopis
? Now the
Lord will not even look at a womanÂ’s face. Why did He become a 
sannyasi
 holding a 
danda
?


 


3) Rejecting His garments
of a playful lover, the Lord now wanders from place to place. Going from house
to house, He visits the fallen people. With the 
cintamani

jewels of His glorious virtues He delivers the people of the world. Only 
Balarama
 
dasa
 is left behind.
