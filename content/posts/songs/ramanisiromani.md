TRANSLATION


1)
The beloved daughter of King Vrsabhanu is the crest-jewel of all young women.
She is fond of wearing blue garments. Her radiant complexion is very pleasing
and conquers the beauty of freshly cut gold, Her locks of hair are nicely
arranged, and She is the life and soul of Lord Krsna.


 


2)
She is artfully adorned with jewels, She is very learned in the science of Hari-rasa,
and Her forehead is nicely decorated with tilaka. Her breasts are covered with
a beautiful corset and adorned with valuable gems, and Her eyes are anointed
with black collyrium. Thus She appears to be relishable sweetness personified.


 


3)
Giving up everything and becoming a maidservant at the lotus feet of Radha,
just worship and serve Her with great care and attention.


 


4)
Beholding Her effulgent rays of pure beauty, the goddesses Rati, Gauri, and
Lila abandon all their pride.


 


5)
The good fortune attributed to the goddesses Saci, Laksmi, and Satya is
completely defeated in the presence of Radha's feet.


 


6)
The group of rival gopis led by Candravali is forced to accept their defeat
before Srimati Radharani, for She alone controls Krsna. Thus they always sulk
and simply remain quarrelsome.


 


7)
Bhaktivinoda, a resident of Sri Godruma, always endeavors for the lotus feet of
Radha, the most beloved of Lord Hari.
