TRANSLATION


1)
Lord 
Gaura
 is the life's breath or 
Gadadhara
 
dasa
. Hearing the
pastimes He enjoyed in His previous 
avataras
, Lora 
Gaura
 is overcome with ecstasy.


 


2)
Lora 
Gaura's
 complexion is fair like a lightning
flash. His original form, the form or 
Krsna
, is
carefully hidden within Him. Tears of ecstatic love stream from Lora 
Gaura's
 lotus eyes.


 


3)
Lora 
Gaura's
 face is like a golden lotus. Lora 
Gaura
 joyfully laughs, showing the pearls of His graceful
teeth.


 


4)
Overcome with ecstasy, He trembles. The hairs of His body stand erect. 
Calling out Â“
Hari
!
 
Hari
!"

He jumps in the air.


 


5)
Overwhelmed by tasting the nectar of devotion from a person who is actually
Himself, He does not know if it is day or night. 


 


6) His lotus feet resemble
the thunder clouds.


 


7) His ecstatic nectar of
devotional love is enough to flood the three worlds. Only 
Yadu


Dasa
, due to his reactions of 
fruitive

actions, is denied of this.
