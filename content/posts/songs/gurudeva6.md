TRANSLATION


1)
Gurudeva! Because you are so merciful, you gave me a place in Godruma amid the
woodlands of Gauda, with this order to fulfill: Â“Dwell here in this Vrndavana
and sing the holy name of Hari.Â”


 


2)
But when, O master, out of your great mercy, will you bestow upon this servant
of yours the spiritual competence to fulfill that order? When will my mind
become tranquil and fixed? When will I endure all hardships and serve Lord Hari
without distractions?


 


3)
Due to attachment to worldly pleasures in childhood and youth, I have developed
bad habits. Because of these sinful acts my body has become an impediment to
the service of the Supreme Lord.


 


4)
Now, in old age, afflicted by the five-fold illnesses, how will I serve the
Lord? O master, please tell me. I have fallen at your feet weeping, overwhelmed
by anxiety.


 


REMARKS/EXTRA
INFORMATION:

is the Hindi translation of the song Â“
