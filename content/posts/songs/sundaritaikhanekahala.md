TRANSLATION


(Refrain)
O beautiful girl, the enchantment of your love for Him grew stronger and
stronger. In the end you will pass this lifetime only in weeping.


 


1)
When you heard the sweetness of 
Krsna's
 flute-music,
I blocked your ears. When you gazed at 
Krsna's

handsome form, I covered your eyes. You were very determined to be enchanted by
Him.


 


2)
For no reason you pined to attain Him. What has become of your body? Day after
day the beauty of your body wasted away. Now even your life is in doubt.


 


3)
In your heart you planted the tree of love for Him. You expected the dark rain
cloud of Krsna would water that tree with its nectar rains. Alas! Now that tree
is watered only with the tears from your eyes. This 
Govinda


dasa
 says.
