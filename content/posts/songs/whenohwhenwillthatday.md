LYRICS:


(1)


When,
oh when will that day be mine?


When
my offenses ceasing taste for the name increasing


when
in my heart will your mercy shine


when,
oh when will that day be mine 


 


(2)



Lower
than a blade of grass, more tolerant than a tree. 


When
will my mind attain this quality? 


Respectful
to all, not expecting their honor,


then
shall I taste the name's nectar sublime.


 


(3)


Great
wealth or followers, feminine beauty


I
won't care for them or the comforts of my body.


Birth
after birth, give me, Oh Lord Caitanya


causeless
devotion to Your feet divine


 


(4)


When
will I utter Krsna, Krsna, Krsna,


with
words choked up and shivering body?


When
will I be trembling all over, lose bodily color,


tears
pouring from my eyes,


 


(5)


When
in Navadvipa along the Ganges bank,


shouting
'Gaura-Nityananda' as a surrendered soul,


dancing,
chanting, running everywhere,


when
will I become half mad of mind?


 


(6)


When
will Lord Nityananda show mercy upon me,


when
will I reject the world of Maya:


'
Bestow unto me the shade of Your lotus feet


let
the right to preach the name be mine.


 


(7)


I
will beg, borrow, or steal the nectar of the name.


By
the name's effect I will feel paralyzed.


Oh!
Enjoyed of the nectar of the name


when
will I touch your lotus feet till the end of time?


 


(8)


When
kindness to all beings will be appearing


with
free heart forget myself comforting


Bhaktivinoda
in all humility prays


"Now
I will set out to preach Your order sublime."
