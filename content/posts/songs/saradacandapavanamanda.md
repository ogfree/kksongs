TRANSLATION


1)
The autumn moon glistened. A gentle breeze blew. A fragrance of flowers filled
the forest. 
Mallika
, 
malati
,
and 
yuthi
 flowers bloomed. Intoxicated black bees
flew.


 


2)
The 
gopis
 looked at the splendid night. They were
enchanted by dark Krsna. They had fallen in love with Him. From a flute
somewhere 
came
 melodies on the fifth note, melodies
that robbed the saintly 
gopis
 of their hearts.


 


3)
Hearing the music, the 
gopis
 were overcome with
feelings of love. Entering the 
gopis
' thoughts and
there speaking eloquent words, the sweet flute-music aroused the 
gopis
' desire to enjoy with Krsna.


 


4)
Overcome, the 
gopis
 forgot their homes and their own
bodies. To only one eye they applied black 
kajjala
.
On only one ankle they placed a jangling anklet. On only one ear they placed a
swinging earring.


 


5)
Their tight belts became loosened. Quickly the teenage 
gopis

ran. Their belts, bodices, and garments became loose and began to slip. Their
braids were tossed to and fro.


 


6)
Somehow the 
gopis
 all met. As they walked, they could
not see the path before them. They met Lord Krsna, who is like a glorious moon
shining in 
Gokula
. Thus sings 
Govinda


dasa
.
