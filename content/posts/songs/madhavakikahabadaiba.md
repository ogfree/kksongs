TRANSLATION


(Refrain) O 
Krsna
, how can I describe my fate? How many calamities fell
on me as I walked here on the path? Even if I had millions and millions of
mouths, I could not describe them all.


 


1) Leaving my house, I
began walking here. When I saw night fall, my body trembled. Great darkness
made the path impassable. I had no power to see anything. Snakes slithered
about my feet.


 


2) I was all alone. The
night was fearful. The path was very long. Then clouds rained and rained. Every
place was flooded. Where could I go?


 


3) My lotus feet became
adorned with mud. Again and again I was pricked by thorns. I yearned to see
You. I didn't know where to go. Then my long sufferings fled far away.


 


4) The sound of Your
flute-music entered my ears. Then I turned away from any wish to be happy in my
home. Now I think all the troubles I met on that path to be insignificant like
a blade of grass. So says 
Govinda
 
dasa
.
