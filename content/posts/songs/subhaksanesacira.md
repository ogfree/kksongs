TRANSLATION


(Refrain) At an auspicious
moment 
Saci's
 son accepts the sacred thread.


 


1) In 
Jagannatha


Misra's
 house auspicious instrumental-music plays.


 


2) The ladies have come for
the ritual. The poets recite many poems.


 


3) What other sacred thread
is like this one? This sacred thread is Lord 
Ananta

Himself manifest in a very slender form.


 


4) His head now free of
hair, the Lord's face is sweet and charming. Does He or does He not rob
everyone's heart?


 


5) He wears saffron
garments. He fills the ten directions with light.


 


6) On four sides is the
assembly of 
brahmanas
. In the center is Lord 
Gaura
, the king of 
brahmanas
.


 


7) In His hand and on His
shoulder are a 
brahmacari-danda
 and a 
jhuli
 alms-bag. Seeing Him, who can remain peaceful and
indifferent?


 


8) He is glorious like Lord

Vamana
 Himself. His every gesture charms the hearts
of all the worlds.


 


9) Gently smiling, He
speaks sweet words. Approaching the devotees, He begs alms.


 


10) Everyone gazes at Him.
In their hearts they give their life's breath to Him as alms. No fear in their
hearts, they offer alms to Him.


 


11) Infiltrating the crowd
of human ladies, the demigoddesses gaze at Lord 
Gaura's

moonlike face. They also offer alms to Him.


 


12) Who does not worship
Lord 
Gaura
, dedicating his whole life to Him?
Everyone calls out, Â“
Jaya
!"


 


13) 
Ghanasyama

says: An ocean of bliss now floods 
Jagannatha
 
Misra's
 house.
