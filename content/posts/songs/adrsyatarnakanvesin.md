TRANSLATION


1) O
Krsna, when the calves disappeared, You began to search for them in order to
allay the fears of the cowherd boys; The boys then also could not be found, and
You began to search for both the calves and the boys.


 


2) O
Krsna, understanding that Lord Brahma had stolen the calves and the cowherd
boys, You assumed the forms of the stolen boys and calves, so that the mothers
of the boys and calves might become happy.


 


3) O
Krsna, perfectly imitating the forms and activities of each cowherd boy of
Vraja and of each calf, entered the homes of all of the boys and calves.
