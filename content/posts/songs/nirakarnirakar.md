TRANSLATION


1) O
brothers, by your screaming out again and again, "The Supreme Lord is
formless! The Absolute Truth is a void!Â” why do you so insist on disturbing the
peace of the Vaisnavas?


 


2)
Having accepted this impersonal philosophy, which you consider to be very good,
you are simply wasting so much time. You should understand this essential
truth: Without devotion for the Supreme Lord, no factual gain is brought about
by engaging in mere dry arguments.


 


3)
Your birth as a human being is useless, for although you are supposed to be great
philosophers, you did not judge rightly in this regard-by the power of mundane
logic and argument you have failed to taste the bliss of pure devotion to the
Supreme Lord.


 


4) If
I worship Krsna under the shelter of Srila Rupa Goswami, and thereby deeply
immerse myself in divine love for Lord Hari-and you are unable to attain that
state, O brothers, then what will you do? What more will you say?
