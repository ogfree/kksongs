TRANSLATION


1)
Lord Krsna wears yellow garments and His lovely, dark complexioned body is
decorated with sandalwood paste. While He enjoys loving pastimes with His 
gopis
, His jewel earrings dance over His cheeks as He
smiles at them.


 


2)
Look 
Radhe
! Look at 
KrsnaÂ’s

loving and divine 
lila
 with
all of His surrendered 
gopis
!


 


3)
One beautiful 
gopi
 lovingly smacks Krsna with the
heavy weight of her devotion! Then she sings to Him from the fifth scale at a
higher octave.


 


4-5)

One
 charmed 
gopi
 fixes her
love filled gaze upon 
KrsnaÂ’s
 
mukharvinda.Aho
!
Her playful, batting eyes light become lamps of love for 
KrsnaÂ’s

heart! A 
gopi
 attempts to whisper something to 
KrsnaÂ’s
 ear, but ends up kissing His cheek. 


 


6)
One haughty 
gopi
 grabs hold of 
KrsnaÂ’s

garments to playfully pull Him into a solitary location beside the 
Yamuna
.


 


7)
Another 
gopi
 is dancing with the 
rasa

with Krsna. As He plays the flute; she claps her hands making her bracelets
sweetly tinkle in time with the music. Seeing her skill, Krsna praises.


 


8)
Krsna embraces a 
gopi
, kisses another, and associates
with someone else. Then, He eagerly smiles to attract another 
gopi
 with His vulnerable eyes. However, noticing a
resisting damsel, who is ever more beautiful, He begins pursuing her.


 


9)
Â  
O reader! Let 
JayadevaÂ’s

description of Sri 
KesavaÂ’s
 amazing and secret 
Vrndavana
 
prema
 
keli
 bring good fortune to you.
