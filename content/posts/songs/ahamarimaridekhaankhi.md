TRANSLATION


1)
O! O! O! Fill your eyes with this sight! Look at these glorious forms that
charm all the worlds! Look at Lord Advaita, at Lord Nityananda, the root of all
bliss, and at Lord Caitanya, the king of the nectar of spiritual love!


 


2)
The glories of Their faces eclipse the glistening moon. They take away
Kamadeva's pride. Their gentle gentle smiles bring a flood of nectar, a monsoon
rain of nectar. 


 


3)
They are effulgent. Their tilaka markings are glorious. Their eyes and eyebrows
are graceful. Their glorious graceful arms rest at the side of Their chests,
chests that attract the sagesÂ’ hearts.


 


4)
On Their necks rests garlands of many different flowers. Their garments are
glorious. The reddish soles of their feet gloriously stand in Ghanasyama's
heart.
