TRANSLATION


1)
"May the young prince of 
Vraja
, whose bodily
luster defeats the pride of a monsoon cloud, the luster of Whose garment
defeats that of the filaments of a 
lotusflower
 and
the moon of Whose childhood becomes afflicted when he sees the sun of His
adolescence rising, fulfill my desire!" 


 


2)
"May the young prince of 
Vraja
, Who constantly
stirs innumerable life-airs of His father, Who is the embodiment of His
mother's great maternal love, and Who is the nectar wick for the eyes of His
favorable superiors, fulfill my desire."


 


3)
"May the young prince of 
Vraja
, Who is the
foremost and most splendid guru of all charming arts in the whole universe, Who
is the most elevated resting place of valorous transcendental bliss and Who
delights His innumerable friends with all His matchless attributes, fulfill my
desire."


 


4)
"May the young prince of 
Vraja
, Who, by twanging
the bow of His eyebrows, causes waves of agitation in the minds of the young
girls that are hard to generate even by trillions of Cupids, and Who is the
ocean in which the fish-like hearts of His dear friends play, fulfill my
desire."


 


5)
"May the young prince of 
Vraja
, Whose goad-like
eyes blissfully strike and agitate the elephant of erotic desires, thus causing
it to wreak havoc in the depth of the lake of Sri 
Radha's

heart, and Who is the bumblebee who relishes the honey of 
rasika

loving pastimes, fulfill my desire!"


 


6)
"May the young prince of 
Vraja
, Whose constant
love for Sri 
Radha
 defeats even the constant
passionate love of the pairs of 
Cakravaka
 flamingoes
(since they are separated at night, while 
Krsna
 can
meet 
Radha
 day and night) and Who is the ocean
wherein all the honey-rivers of sweetness stream, fulfill my desire!"


 


7)
"May the young prince of 
Vraja
, Whose
indomitable lordly elephant-heart, which cannot be checked by anything within
the three worlds, is bound by the strong and crooked ropes of Sri 
Radha's
 glance, and Whose face smiles as He hears the
blissful jokes of talkative 
Visakha
, fulfill my
desire!"


 


8)
"May the young prince of 
Vraja
, Who by embarrasses

Radha
 by revealing His intimate pastimes with 
Her
, telling one girlfriend: "O 
sakhi
!
Just see how Your 
sakhi's
 waist bells shine, even
though She quickly and hypocritically put them on again after suddenly meeting
you in solitude at dawn!
",
 fulfill my
desire!"


 


9)
"Sri 
Krsna
, Who knows the flavors of Sri 
Vrndavanesvari
 
Radhika's
 
prema
, will be pleased with anyone who carefully and with a
satisfied heart, recites these eight verses, that describe the excellent
enjoyments of the young prince of 
Vraja
, and will
count him by name amongst His own intimate associates."
