TRANSLATION


1) According to the
particular type of attachment that attracts one to love 
Krsna
,
the devotee becomes attached to that degree in one of the five direct mellows.
Besides to this direct attachment, there are occasional manifestations of the
seven indirect mellows, which follow the direct attachment. Thus the seven indirect
attachments remain subjugated under the shelter of the ecstatic emotions
presented by the more predominant direct mellow.


 


2) Oh brothers! Now listen
as I sing of the glories of the 
madhura
 
rasa
, the sweet conjugal mellow, for it is said to be the
best and most powerful 
rasa
 amongst all the five
direct mellows. Indeed, it is just like the king of all mellows. All the
transcendental 
qualities of the other mellows
 are
fully present in this topmost of all 
rasas
, and
therefore it is most powerful because of the combined potencies of all the
other mellows contained within it. And also, the other mellows individually
become more powerful when they are within the 
madhura


rasa
 than they are when they stand on their own.


 


3) All the seven indirect
mellows give transitory stimulation to the 
madhura
 
rasa
 (also called 
srngara
 
rasa
). They also circulate to nourish and supplement the
ecstasies of the conjugal mellow. Those devotees who develop attachment for the
worship that follows in the footsteps of 
Srila
 
Rupa
 
Gosvami
 become situated and
firmly established only in this conjugal mellow.


 


4) The 
madhura


rasa
 is known as the most brilliant mellow, and its
main subject is Sri 
Krsna
, the Son of the King of 
Vraja
. Indeed, He actually lets Himself be controlled and
subjugated by this loving mellow. The majestic 
opulences

of the Lord (
aisvarya
) are covered over, and the
powerful maddening influence of its transcendental sweetness (
madhurya
) is the sole refuge of all the assembled devotees,
who are the object of this mellow.
