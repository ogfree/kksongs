TRANSLATION


1) Sri
Nityananda Prabhu is the embodiment of eternal bliss. He is the moon of all
avadhutas and the beloved of the life-breath of Vasudha (His wife). Lord
Nityananda is the husband, enthusing Jahnavi with life. Nityananda Rama bestows
ecstatic love for Krishna and He is the Lord and Master of the devotees.


 


2) Sri
Nityananda is the dear son of Padmavati and He is full of splendorous
transcendental majesty. Nitai is the older brother of Sacimata's son Nimai.
Nityananda Avadhuta is maddened in overwhelming ecstatic emotions. Sri
Nityananda Prabhu is the savior of the universe. His complexion is golden
tinged with red.



3-4) That person who recites these twelve auspicious holy names of the moonlike
Nityananda-candra every day upon arising in the morning such a person becomes
free from all difficulties and attains all their most cherished desires. Very
soon they become the object of Lord Caitanya-deva's mercy.


 


REMARKS/EXTRA
INFORMATION:


This
chant can sometimes have the refrain of Â“nitāi rāmaÂ” after every
verse.
