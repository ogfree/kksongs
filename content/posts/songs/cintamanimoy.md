TRANSLATION


1) The banks of Sri 
Radha-kunda
 are made of billions of conscious, ecstatic
desire-fulfilling touchstones, and surrounding the lake are hundreds and
hundreds of beautiful transcendental gardens and groves. All the trees and
creepers in those gardens are made of coral and rubies, and the fruits they
produce are diamonds and pearls. And their branches are bending down to the
ground due to being overburdened with millions of these lovely gems.


 


2) My small cottage is
shining beautifully within that most enchanting garden called 
Svananda-sukhada-kunja
. Living there, I will sing 
Krsna's
 holy name, and I will greedily hanker for that time
when I will get the service of Him and His associates.


 


3) At this time, while
thinking like this, the songs of a transcendental flute will suddenly enter
this maidservant's ear. Becoming madly excited by such a sound, I will forget
everything and will only listen spellbound to those wonderful songs of Sri 
Krsna's
 flute.


 


4) The low, deep sound of
His long 
murali
 flute will call out, 
"
Radhe
. . .
 
Radhe
. . .
"
--- the very name of my only 
worshipable
 Empress and
Maharani! Startled with wonder by hearing such a sound, this maidservant will
then stand up in great haste with an anxious heart, wondering what to do next.
