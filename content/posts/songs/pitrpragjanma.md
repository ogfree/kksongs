TRANSLATION


1) O Lord Krsna, in three
births 
You
 became the Son of 
Devaki

and 
Vasudeva
. When 
You
 were
born in Your father's presence, You were pleased by His sincere worship, and
You granted all benedictions to him.


 


2) O beautiful Krsna, O
Supreme Spirit whose form resembles that of 
a
 a human
child, and who performs pastimes in that eternal form, giving great
transcendental bliss to Your mother and father, (all glories unto You).


 


3) O Krsna, You instructed
(
Vasudeva
) how 
You
 could
escape (the wrath of 
Kamsa
) and You bewildered the
guards standing at the prison gate and caused them all to fall asleep. It was
by 
Your
 arrangement that Your potency Maya was born as
the daughter of 
Yasoda
.


 


4) O Krsna, Your potency
unlocked all the doors and 
You
 were carried away by
Your father. The hoods of the serpent 
Ananta
 
Sesa
 became 
Your
 umbrella, and the

Yamuna
 river gave You a clear path.


 


5) O Lord Krsna, O Great
Auspiciousness of 
Vraja
, You were placed on 
Yasoda's
 bed. And she, 
Nanda
 
Mahraja
 and the other cowherd men, bewildered by sleep, did
not notice. (All glories unto 
You
).
