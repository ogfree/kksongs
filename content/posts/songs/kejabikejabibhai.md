TRANSLATION


1)
Who will go? Who will go, brothers? Who will cross over this ocean of material
suffering? This Kali-
yuga
 in which Sri 
Caitanya-avatara
 has appeared is blessed. [
Caitanya-avatara
 does not come in every Kali-
yuga
.]


 


2)
At the bathing place of my 
Gauranga
, a free
ferry-boat is waiting. There is no restriction Â– everyone is coming, including
the lame, blind and distressed. All are climbing aboard to cross over.


 


3)

Harinama
 is the boat, Sri Guru is the helmsman and
the 
sankirtana
 
party moving with
up-raised arms are
 the oars!


 


4)
All souls can cross over with the favorable winds of 
prema
.
Only 
Locana
 
dasa
 is so
unfortunate that, due to his own fault, he has been left behind.


 


REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:


This
song is sung in 
Bhatiyali
 (fisherman) style of
Bengali folk music.
