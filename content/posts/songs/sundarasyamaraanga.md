TRANSLATION


(Refrain)
Dark-limbed Krsna is handsome and charming. His garments and necklace are
glorious. His limbs covered with dust raised by the cows' hooves, He charms
every heart.


 


1)
Â  
He leads the cows back to 
Vraja

Village. His friends return to their own homes. He ties the calves. Tying the
cows, again and again He draws milk from them.


 


2)
He is decorated with new 
new
 leaves. On His head 
is
 a peacock feather and a ring of flowers. His shark-shaped
jewel earrings swing to and fro. Gazing at Him, how many 
Kamadevas

are overcome with wonder?


 


3)
His chest is glorious with a forest-flower garland. His anklets and belt
jangle. 
Govinda
 
dasa's

master charms the hearts of the entire world. He delights 
Vraja's

teenage girls.
