TRANSLATION


1) My dear mind, all I can
see is unlimited material miseries and difficulties on all sides. Especially
there are these five specific troubles: 1) ignorance, 2) distraction, 3) 
mis
-concentration, 4) 
mis
-directed
love, and 5) impurity.


 


2) (According to 
Patanjali's
 Yoga-sutra, 
Sadhana-pada
,

third
 sutra) The affliction of these five miseries
results in continuous degradation in the following ways: 1) 
avidya
:
ignorance makes me completely forgetful of my nature as pure spirit soul 2) 
asmita
: conceited egoistic pride causes me to be distracted
from the real essence of life. 3) 
abhinivesa
:
I have become deeply absorbed in trivial pursuits; 4) raga: I've developed love
and attachment to things which are averse to pure God-consciousness; and 5) 
dvesa
: my soul has become filthy and polluted by nasty
qualities.


 


3) Due to all these
distracting troubles, I am forgetting my real home in the spiritual world, the
eternal land of no anxiety. And I have become completely mad by frantically
trying to enjoy all the so-called enjoyments offered by 
maya's

illusions. Thus I surround myself with so many misconceptions of "me, me, 
me
". Oh mind, my dear brother, just see how my heart
has become full of so much anxiety due to constant worries about "this is 
mine, that
 is mine".


 


4) I am searching for the
remedy to cure this material disease of being tortured by 
Yamaraja
,
but oh no! I've met a doctor who is no better than 
Yamaraja

at all. This 'doctor' has given me the prescription "I am Brahman, 
maya
 is false", but now when I see the result of this
so-called medicine, I feel an unbearable anxiety in my conscience.


 


5) On one side I feel great
difficult and grief from these five material miseries and on the other side
stands the corrupted doctor (the 
Mayavadi
 who is just
like another 
Yamaraja
). How will I ever be able to
get freed from being sandwiched in between this tormenting agony? There is only
one remedy, that is: if I would simply take complete shelter of Lord 
Caitanya
, Who is know to be the Most Merciful, then only I
will easily cross over this ghastly calamity.
