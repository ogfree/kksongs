TRANSLATION


Refrain: 
Radha
, give up 
Your
 anguish. Make 
Your
 soft lotus feet peacefully walk on this path to the
meeting with Krsna. 


 


1) Why do 
You
 not stop this continual talking. The splendor of 
Your
 teeth dispels the great darkness of this talk.


 


2) With the splendor of 
Your
 fingernails dispel the darkness of Your cloud-black
hair. 
Â Â Â 


 


3) Your heart is now fixed
on the eternal Supreme Personality of Godhead and 
Your

doubts and fears are gone. Now please go to the middle of this charming forest
grove.


 


REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:


Srila
 
Jiva
 
Gosvami

explains that after 
Radharani's
 messenger had
presented her plaint, Lord Krsna replied: "O messenger, why do you speak
in this contrary way? I always think of 
Radha
.
Indeed, I remain alive only by meditating on 
Her
."
Filled with ecstatic love for Krsna, the 
gopi

messenger returned to 
Radha
' on the path and sang
this song to Her.


 


This song is sung in Raga 
Asavari
.
