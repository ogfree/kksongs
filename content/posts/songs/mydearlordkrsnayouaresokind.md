LYRICS:


(1)


My
dear Lord Krsna You are so kind upon this useless soul


but I
do not know why You have brought me here. 


Now
You can do with me whatever You like.


 


(2)


But I
guess YouÂ’ve got some business here


Since
You brought me to this terrible place


Most
of the people in ignorance and I donÂ’t know


How
theyÂ’ll understand Your message Divine.


 


(3)


But I
know Your mercy can do anything


YouÂ’re
the most expert mystic of all


Therefore,
IÂ’m praying for Your mercy so that I


Can
convince them of Your message sublime.


 


(Refrain)


O
Lord, IÂ’m just a puppet in Your hands


and
You brought me here to dance


Make
me dance, make me dance, O Lord make me dance.


Make
dance me, dance as you like


Dance,
dance, dance, dance as you like


 


(4)


Everyone
has fallen into Maya by Your will


So by
Your will they can also be free


If You
so desire, You may deliver them


And
they will understand Your words.


 


(5)


I am
the most fallen, so I am seeking Your Grace


So
that I can convince them of Your words


Somehow,
You brought me here to speak about You


Help
make me a success or failure as You like.


 


(6)


You
are the Lord of all souls, if You like


You
can make my speaking suitable


Have
no knowledge or any love


But
You can fulfill the meaning of my name
