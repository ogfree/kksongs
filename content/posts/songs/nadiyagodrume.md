TRANSLATION


1) In
the land of Nadiya, on the island of Godruma, the magnanimous Lord Nityananda
has opened up the Marketplace of the Holy Name, meant for the deliverance of
all fallen souls. 


 


2) O
people of faith! O people of faith! By the order of Lord Gauranga, O brothers,
I beg these three requests of you: Chant "Krsna!", worship Krsna, and
teach others about Krsna. 


 


3)
Being careful to remain free of offenses; just take the holy name of Lord
Krsna. Krsna is your mother, Krsna is your father, and Krsna is the treasure of
your life. 


 


4)
Giving up all sinful activities, carry on your worldly duties only in relation
to Lord Krsna. The showing of compassion to other souls by loudly chanting the
holy name of Krsna is the essence of all forms of religion.
