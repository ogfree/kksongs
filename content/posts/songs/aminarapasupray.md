TRANSLATION


1) Oh my Lord 
Hari
! I am simply a two-legged animal, completely bereft of
proper behavior. I have been suffering great difficulties unlimitedly since
time immemorial. And moreover, I have unavoidably become the repository of all
types of sinful activities.


 


2) You are certainly an
ocean of compassion, and 
You
 are the only real friend
of the universe. Your affection is just like a boundless, unfathomable sea of
loving relationships. Simply by remembering 
Your

wonderful qualities, my material bonds are being severed and I will become
eternally fearless.


 


3) Now 
Bhativinoda

sings about all these desires which he has within his mind while prostrated at
the lotus feet of Sri 
Yamunacarya
. And he begs Sri 
Yamunacarya
 to kindly bestow upon his head the quintessence
of the fragrant immortal nectar which flows from the lotus feet of that
moon-like person 
Who
 glows within the forests on the
bank of the river 
Yamuna
 in 
Vraja
.
