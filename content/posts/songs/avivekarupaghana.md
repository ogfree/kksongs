TRANSLATION


1) Oh my Lord 
Hari
! Ignorance of You is just like a menacing 
raincloud
 which hovers overhead and covers all directions,
causing the darkness of spiritual blindness to envelop me. From this cloud of
ignorance 
falls
 the rains of material tribulations
which strikes fear throughout the four directions. Thus I have become lost and
confused in this darkness, and I am absolutely unable to find the right path
back to 
You
, dear Lord


 


2) By my own fault of
whimsical behavior, independent of You, I have become very angry at my fate of
falling into the foul weather of this most difficult time of distress. And my
life is leaving me while I am thus stranded within this material world, which
is just like a dark forest in which one cannot properly find his way. I have no
guide to show me the way out of here, and by this misfortune I am dying a slow
death. Therefore I now call out to You, 
Acyuta
, oh
supremely infallible Lord!


 


3) If 
You

would just shower the rain of Your kind glance moist with causeless mercy in my
direction just once, oh Lord, then that glance would instantly terminate this
period of great distress for me. Then my understanding of 
Your

spiritual reality will become fixed-up, and then this 
Bhaktivinoda

will be able to properly see the path which leads back to You.
