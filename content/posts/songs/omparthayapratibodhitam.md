TRANSLATION


1) O
Bhagavad-gita, thou hast been instructed to Arjuna, the son of Prtha by the
Lord Himself and afterwards thee were included within the Mahabharata by the
ancient sage Vyasa.Â  Thy eighteen divine chapters are a shower of the immortal
nectar of the wisdom of the Absolute.Â  O mother, destroyer of man's rebirth
into the darkness of this mortal world, upon thee I meditate.


 


2)
Obeisances to You, O Vyasa, thou art of mighty intellect, and thine eyes are
large as the petals of the full-blown lotus.Â  It was by thee that the
oil-filled lamp of knowledge of the Mahabharata was lit.


 


3) I
offer obeisances unto Lord Krsna, the refuge of ocean-born Laksmi and all who
take refuge at His lotus feet. His one hand holds a staff for driving cows, and
the other hand is raised, the thumb touching the tip of the forefinger,
indicating divine knowledge.Â  He is the milker of the immortal nectar of the
Bhagavad-gita.


 


4) The
Upanisads are as a herd of cows, Lord Krsna, son of a cowherd, is their mother,
Arjuna is the calf, the supreme nectar of the Gita is the milk, and the wise
man of purified intellect is the drinker.


 


5) I
offer my obeisances to Lord Krsna, the beloved son of Vasudeva, destroyer of
the demons Kamsa and Canura, the supreme bliss of Mother Devaki and the
spiritual master of the universe.


 


6) Of
the terrifying river of the battlefield of Kuruksetra over which the Pandavas
victoriously crossed, Bhisma and Drona were it's high banks, Jayadratha was the
river's water, the King of Gandhara, the blue water-lily: there were sharks
such as salya, Krpa was the current, Karna, the mighty waves, Asvattham and
Vikarna, the dreadful alligators, and Duryodhana, the very whirlpool, but Lord
Krsna was the ferryman!


 


7) May
the spotless lotus of the words of Vyasa that grows on the eternal waters of
the words of Lord Hari, with its filaments of various tales of heroes and which
is rightly endowed with the sweet fragrance of the explanations of the
Bhagavad-gita, it's nectar beign quaffed with pleasure daily in this world by
saintly persons who are compared to so many nectar-seeking bumble-bees and
which destroys all the sins of the age of Kali - May this lotus of the
Mahabharata bestow on us the highest good.


 


8) I
offer my respectful obeisances unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krsna,
the transcendentally blissful husband of the goddess of fortune, whose mercy
turns the dumb into eloquent speakers and enables to lame to cross mountains.


 


9) Unto
that personality whom Brahma, Varuna, Indra, Rudra and the Maruts praise by
chanting transcendental hymns and reciting the Vedas with all their
corollaries, pada-kramas and Upanisads, to whom the chanters of the Sama Veda
always sing, whom the perfected yogis see within their minds after fixing
themselves in trance and absorbing themselves within Him, and whose limit can
never be found by any demigod or demon Â— unto that Supreme Personality of
Godhead I offer my humble obeisances.
