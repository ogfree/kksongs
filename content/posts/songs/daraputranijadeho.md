TRANSLATION


1)
Within my heart I have always been anxious for the maintenance of my wife and
children, my own body and relatives.


 


2) How
will I earn money? How will I obtain fame? How will I arrange the marriages of
my sons and daughter?


 


3)
Now, through self-surrender, I have been purged of all anxiety. O Lord, surely
You will provide for the maintenance of Your household.


 


4)
Surely You will preserve me, knowing me to be Your own servant. O Lord, in Your
devotional service I feel great happiness.


 


5) All
events take place by Your will, O Lord. The deluded soul of this world
declares, Â“I am the doer,Â” but this is pure folly.


 


6) If
You do not act first, then what is a tiny soul actually able to do? By Your
will he can only desire to act, and unless You fulfill his desire, he cannot do
anything.


 


7) I
will serve You free from all anxiety, and at home, if any good or evil should
occur, it will not be my responsibility.


 


8)
Bhaktivinoda thus gives up his independence and engages in the exclusive
service of Your lotus feet with no other interest in life.
