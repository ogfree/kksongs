TRANSLATION


1) O Lord 
Krsna
, entering the arena, 
You
 appeared to be decorated with all the splendid 
opulences
 of the heroes. You carried the great tusk on 
Your
 shoulder, and You were sprinkled with drops of blood
and rut from the elephant 
Kuvalayapida
.


 


2) O Lord 
Krsna
, please be merciful to
me. Your lotus-face decorated with drops of perspiration, 
You

appeared differently to the different people in the arena, according to the
different relationships they bore with You.


 


3) O Lord 
Krsna
, You appeared as the
greatest hero, as the most beautiful cupid, the greatest friend, the great
supreme controller, the most affectionate, the supreme time-factor, and the
supreme spiritual master.


 


4) O Lord 
Krsna
, You appeared as the
supreme truth, greatly worthy to be served, and enchanting to the minds of all
living entities. Impelled by transcendental love, the people on the dais sang
about 
Your
 great glories.
