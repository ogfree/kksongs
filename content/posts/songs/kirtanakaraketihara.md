TRANSLATION


(Refrain):
By doing Your kirtana, my mind is now purified. By attaining the path to Sri
Krsna, my mind is now purified.


 


1) Srila
Prabhupada has showered Bhagavata Dharma and the path of devotional service.
The sleeping universe was awakened by Srila Prabhupada. After meeting such a
true guru, my mind is now purified.


 


2)
This entire world is being burned by the heat from the fire of sorrow. To be
saved from this sorrows of the world, the Holy Name is the pillar of support! By
calling out to Krsna, my mind is now purified.


 


3) By chanting
Â“Radhe RadheÂ” and walking on the path to my Beloved One, my mind is awakened by
the light of love of Lord Krsna. By offering everything to You and surrender to
Your lotus feet, my mind is now purified.
