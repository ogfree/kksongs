TRANSLATION


1) O mind, I grasp your feet
and beg you with sweet words: Please cast away all hypocrisy and develop
intense, unprecedented love for my spiritual master, Vrajabhumi, the people of
Vraja, the Vaisnavas, the brahmanas, the Gayatri mantra, the holy name, and the
transcendental shelter that is the fresh young couple of Vraja, Radha and
Krsna.


 


2) O Mind, donÂ’t concern
yourself with the pious and impious deeds described in the Vedas. Rather,
intently serve Sri Sri Radha-Krsna in Vraja. Always remember that Lord Caitanya
is the son of Maharaja Nanda and that my guru is most dear to Lord Mukunda.


 


3) O Mind, just listen to
me! If you desire to reside in Vraja birth after birth, and if you desire to
directly serve the divine youthful couple there with great attraction, then
with intense love always remember and bow down to Srila Svarupa Damodara
Gosvami; to Srila Rupa Gosvami and his elder brother, Srila Sanatana Gosvami;
and to all their associates and followers.


 


4) O mind, give up
friendship with nondevotees, which is nothing but a prostitute who will steal
the treasure of your heartÂ–your desire to serve Radha-Krsna. DonÂ’t listen to
talks of impersonal liberation, which are a tigress who devours everyone. You
should even give up attraction for Lord Narayana, which leads to the world of Vaikuntha.
Instead, O mind, just worship Sri Sri Radha-Krsna in Vraja, for They bestow
upon their worshipers the jewel of pure love for Themselves.


 


5) The highwaymen of lust
and his friends have bound me around the neck with the painful, horrible,
powerful ropes of many wicked deeds. O mind, please scream out to the devotees
of Krsna, the killer of Baka, "I am being killed!" Then He will save
me.


 


6) O Mind, why do you burn
us both by bathing in the urine trickling from the ass of great deviousness and
hypocrisy? Instead, you should delight us by eternally bathing in the
glistening nectar-ocean of pure love for Sri Sri Gandharva-Giridhari (Sri Sri
Radha-Krsna).


 


7) As long as the impudent
untouchable woman of the desire for fame dances in my heart, why should pure
love for Radha-Krsna touch me? O mind, continuously serve my spiritual master,
the leader of those who are dear to the Lord. Then my master will quickly kick
out that harridan and allow that pure love to enter. 


 


8) So That He will
mercifully smash my wickedness (even though I am a great rascal), so that He
will give me the splendid nectar of transcendental love, and so He will engage
me in Sri RadhaÂ’s service, please, O mind, with words choked with emotion,
worship Lord Giridhari here in Vraja.


 


9) O mind, please meditate
on Krsna, the moon of Vraja forest, as the Lord of my controller, Srimati
Radharani. And please meditate upon Srimati Radharani, the queen of Vraja
forest, as KrsnaÂ’s controller. Also please meditate upon Lalita as the peerless
friend of Radha and Krsna, Visakha as the guru who teaches Them many things,
and Radha-kunda and Govardhana Hill as two places the mere sight of which
bestows charming transcendental love for the divine couple.


 


10) O mind, please worship
Lord HariÂ’s beloved Radha. with the splendor of Her beauty She makes Rati,
Gauri, and Lila burn with envy, with the power of Her good fortune She defeats
Saci, Laksmi, and Satyabhama, and with Her ability to control Krsna She
completely eclipses Candravali and the other pious young girls of Vraja.


 


11) O mind, in order to
attain the direct service of the two divine lovers, Sri Sri Radha-Giridhari, in
the company of Their friends, every day you must constantly drink, with Sri
Rupa Gosvami, the five nectars of worshiping Them, chanting Their names,
meditating on Them, hearing about Them, and bowing down before Them, and every
day you must worship Govardhana Hill.


 


12) These eleven excellent
instructions to the mind grant all spiritual benedictions. A person who stays
with the devotees, follows Srila Rupa Gosvami, and with a sweet voice loudly
sings these eleven verses will attain the matchless jewel of direct service to
Sri Sri Radha-Krsna in the forest of Gokula.
