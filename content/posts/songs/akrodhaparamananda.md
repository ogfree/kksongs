WORD
FOR WORD TRANSLATION: 
Akrodha Paramananda
Nityananda Ray


 


TRANSLATION


1) The
noble Lord Nityananda is never angry, for He is the personification of supreme
transcendental bliss. Devoid of any concept of false ego, Nitai wanders about
the town.


 


2)
Going from door to door in the residences of the most fallen and wretched
souls, He freely distributes the gift of the Hari-nama mahamantra.


 


3) He
exclaims to whomever he sees while holding straw between his teeth, Â“Please
purchase me by worshipping Gaurahari!Â”


 


4)
Saying thus, Nityananda Prabhu rolls about on the ground, appearing like a
golden mountain tumbling in the dust.


 


5)
Locana Dasa Thakura says, Â“Whoever has not experienced the awakening of
affection for such an avatara as this, that sinful person simply comes and goes
uselessly in the cycle of repeated birth and death.Â”
