TRANSLATION


1)

Radha
 is sweet like nectar. 
Krsna

is sweet like nectar. Why do 
They
 quarrel? Who knows?


 


2)
Angrily 
They
 turn from each other. They will not meet.
Still, 
They
 both enter 
Vrndavana

forest.


 


3)
O 
gopi
-friend, what shall I say to make 
Them
 smile and laugh? How shall I arrange that 
They
 enjoy wonderful pastimes together?


 


4)
Tears streamed from their eyes as 
They
 gazed at the
pathway. They entered the forest darkness.


 


5)
They asked about each other. Their hearts were stubborn and contrary. They each
called out the name of a special 
gopi
-friend. 


 


6)
To those friends 
They
 told what was in Their hearts.
Those two friends met, hugged, and told what they had heard.


 


7)
Then 
Radha
 and 
Krsna
 met
and embraced. 
Govinda
 
dasa

asks: What pastimes did 
They
 enjoy then?
