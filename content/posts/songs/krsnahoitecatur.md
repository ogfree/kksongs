TRASLATION



1)
In the beginning of creation the science of devotional service was received by
the four-headed Brahma from the Supreme Lord Sri Krsna. Devarsi Narada's
understanding of this divine science was obtained from Brahma. The great sage
Krsna Dvaipayana Vyasa, who was empowered to compile the Vedic literatures,
became a disciple of Devarsi Narada. Sripada Madhvacarya, the founder of the
suddha-dvaita school of Vedanta philosophy, who visited Vyasadeva at
Badarikasrama in the thirteenth century to learn from him Vedanta philosophy,
calls himself a servant of Krsna Dvaipayana Vyasa. Purnaprajna Tirtha [Madhva]
is the guru and sole refuge of Padmanabha Tirtha. 


 


2)
The two other principal disciples of Madhva are Nrhari Tirtha and Madhava
Tirtha. Madhava Tirtha accepted the great paramhamsa Aksobhya Tirtha as a
disciple. The principal disciple of Aksobhya Tirtha was known as Jayatirtha.
Jayatirtha's service was for his disciple Jnanasindhu. 


 


3)
Dayanidhi received the science of devotional service from Jnanasindhu, and the
servant of Dayanidhi was Vidyanidhi [Vidyadhiraja Tirtha]. Rajendra Tirtha
became a disciple of Vidyadhiraja Tirtha. Rajendra Tirtha's servant was known
as Jayadharma or Vijayadhvaja Tirtha. In this way you should properly
understand this disciplic succession. 


 


4)
The great sannyasi Sri Purusottama Tirtha received his knowledge in the service
of his guru, Vijayadhvaja Tirtha [Jayadharma]. The principal disciple of
Purusottama Tirtha was Subrahmanya Tirtha. His servant was the great
Vyasatirtha [Vyasa Raya]. Vyasatirtha's servant was Laksmipati Tirtha, whose
disciple was Madhavendra Puri Gosvami. 


 


5)
The chief disciple of Madhavendra Puri was Isvara Puri, and two of his other
disciples were the renowned incarnations of Godhead Sri Nityananda and Advaita
Acarya. Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, the spiritual preceptor of all the worlds made
Isvari Puri greatly fortunate by accepting him as His spiritual master. 


 


6)
Mahaprabhu Sri Caitanya is non different from Sri Sri Radha and Krsna and is
the very life of those Vaisnavas who follow Sri Rupa Gosvami. Sri Svarupa
Damodara Gosvami, Rupa Gosvami, and Sanatana Gosvami were the givers of great
happiness to Visvambhara [Sri Caitanya]. 


 


7)
The great souls Jiva Gosvami and Raghunatha Dasa Gosvami became very dear to Rupa
Gosvami. Jiva Gosvami was a disciple of Rupa Gosvami, and Raghunatha Dasa
Gosvami, a disciple of Advaita Acarya's disciple Yadunandana Acarya, was
accepted by Rupa and Sanatana as their third brother. Raghunatha dasa Gosvami's
beloved student was Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami. Krsnadasa Kaviraja was an
intimate friend of Lokanatha Gosvami. They lived together in Vrndavana and
always discussed the topics of Krsna with one another. Lokanatha Gosvami, a
disciple of Gadadhara Pandita, had only one disciple, whose name was Narottama
Dasa. Narottama Dasa was always engaged in the service of his guru, and he also
engaged himself in the service of his guru's intimate friend. Thus he became
very dear to Krsnadasa Kaviraja Gosvami. To serve I the feet of Narottama Dasa
Thakura was the only desire of Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura, who was the
fourth acarya in disciplic succession from Narottama Dasa. 


 


8)
Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura was the siksa-guru [instructing spiritual master]
of Baladeva Vidyabhusana, to whom he taught the precepts of Srimad-Bhagavatam.
Jagannatha Dasa Babaji was a very prominent acarya after Sri Baladeva
Vidyabhusana and was the beloved siksa-guru of Sri Bhaktivinoda Thakura.
Bhaktivinoda Thakura's intimate friend and associate was the eminent maha-bhagavata
Sri Gaurakisora Dasa Babaji, whose sole joy was found in hari-bhajana. 


 


9)
These treat saintly Vaisnavas are all paramahamsas, or devotees of the highest
order, and they are all part of Lord Gauranga's own spiritual family. Their
holy feet are my refuge. I have no real interest in devotional services and I
am a poor and lowly tridandi sannyai named Sri Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati. 


 


9A)
The renowned Sri Varsabhanavi-dayita dasa [the initiated name of
Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati] is always engaged in the service of his spiritual
master, Srila Gaurakisora dasa Babaji. His foremost disciple preacher is Sri
A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, who has spread the message of Lord
Caitanya throughout the world and is thus a reservoir of mercy and compassion
for all fallen souls.
