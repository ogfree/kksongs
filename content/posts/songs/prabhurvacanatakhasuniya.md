TRANSLATION


1)
Then, hearing these words of the Lord, 
Srivasa
 
Pandita
 began rolling on the ground, crying out,
"Please hear me, oh Lord! I am simply not able to tolerate any disturbance
or interruption of the ecstatic mellows of 
Your
 
kirtana
!"


 


2)
"Only one of my sons has died, oh Lord, and has that really made me upset?
Even if all of my sons die, then I will certainly get more than enough
happiness by seeing 
You
."


 


3)
"I would certainly die on the spot if I were to interrupt 
Your
 dancing, oh Lord. That is why I did not inform 
You
 of this bad news. For I was dreading the calamity of
disturbing 
Your
 ecstasy."


 


4)
"Lord, if 
You
 will kindly grant us Your
permission now, then we shall all take the boy's body and perform the proper
funeral rites." Hearing this much from the mouth of 
Srivasa


Pandita
, the jewel of the twice-born, Lord 
Gaurasundara
, then broke down and began to weep piteously
on the spot.


 


5)
Crying and crying, the Lord thought within Himself, "How could I possibly
abandon such loving servitors and go elsewhere by taking 
sannyasa
?
If I were to do so, my heart would certainly split." 
Hearing
this type of talk, 
Bhaktivinoda's
 mind become
somewhat fearful.
