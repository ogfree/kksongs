TRANSLATION


1)
Seeing Sri 
Caitanya
 
Mahaprabhu

shows such favorable grace to 
Srivasa
 
Pandita
, all the devotees present there began to dance
ecstatically, and they repeatedly shouted, "
Jaya

Sri 
Caitanya
! 
Jaya
 
Nityananda
!" with resounding voices.


 


2)
It is simply not possible to describe the ecstatic mood that arose in 
Srivasa's
 house at that time, indeed, it was just like a
great war of transcendental emotions was taking place within the battlefield of
tears of joy, all arising due to ecstatic love for 
Krsna
.


 


3)
Then the four brothers of the dead boy came over and fell down at Lord 
Caitanya's
 lotus feet and began weeping and wailing with
piteous voices choked with ecstatic love. Then they began rolling on the
ground, overflowing with pure love while humbly petitioning the Lord as
follows.


 


4)
They said, "Oh Lord of our lives! If calamities like this would happen
every day, then that would only increase our deep loving attachment to Your
lotus feet!"


 


5)
"This calamity of losing our brother today is actually our great fortune,
for on this day we are remembering Your Lordship. If, on some other day, we are
bereft of Your remembrance, then that day is actually the real calamity for us,
oh Lord."


 


6)
Falling down at the feet of 
Srivasa
 
Pandita's
 entire family, 
Bhaktivinoda

thus narrates how their Lord 
Gaurasundara
 is
bestowing His causeless mercy upon all distressed souls.
