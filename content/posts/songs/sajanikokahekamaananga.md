TRANSLATION


(Refrain)
O 
gopi
-friend, was that person I saw 
Kamadeva
 Himself? A hero of playful pastimes, He gracefully
danced under a 
kadamba
 tree.


 


1)
He wore a peacock-feather crown. His jasmine garland was surrounded by black
bees. Intoxicated by the scent of His garland, how many humming bees filled the
four directions?


 


2)
Moving the archer's bows of His eyebrows and emptying the two quivers of His
eyes, how many flower-arrows did He fire? Many playful girls' hearts were
wounded. Those girls could not gaze on anyone but Him.


 


3)
Shark-shaped jewel earrings swung from His ears. 
Govinda


dasa
 says: I think that person must have been more
enchanting than 
Kamadeva
 himself.
