31) 79. who longed to meet
Radha, who hid from Him in the forest, 80. whom playfully arrogant Radha struck
with a lotus earring,


 


32) 81. who broke Radha's
kunkuma armor in the amorous battle, 82. whose handsome form bends in three
places, 83. who places the flute to His lips, 


 


33) 84. whose flute
melodies are the best of all music, 85. who is the king of thousands of gopis,
86. who becomes maddened by drinking the sweet nectar of the rasa dance,


 


34) 87. whose sidelong
glances are agitating as millions of arrows from the god of love, 88. who
dances on the shore of the Yamuna,


 


35) 89. who is the lotus
pond that fulfills the desires of the bumblebee Radha, 90. who smiles at the
jokes of Radha, who has a hidden intention behind Her joking,


 


36) 91. who disguised
Himself as a woman, 92. who fills the heart with wonder, 93. whose lotus mouth
contains a mixture of camphor and betel nuts,


 


37) 94. with whom the gopi
messenger of proud Candravali has arranged a meeting, 95. whose knitted
eyebrows stopped Radha as She approached the toll-station,


 


38) 96. who is embarrassed
by the laughter, tricks, and taunts of Radha's clever messenger, 97. who is the
personified love of the gopis, 98. who is the personified nectar of the
auspicious and blissful mellows of transcendental love,


 


39) 99. who waited at the
place of rendezvous, eagerly listening for beautiful Bhadra's jingling anklets,
100, whom carefully dressed and decorated Padma saw in the path,


 


40) 101. who entered the
path of yearning, distressed Lalita's speculations, 102. who made cheated
Visakha cry, 


 


41) 103. whose face Syama,
separated from Him by a lover's quarrel, longed to see, 104. whose heart
relished Syama's angry condemnation of His unfaithfulness,


 


42) 105. who was happy to
read the letter of Candravali, who was unhappoy to be separated from Him, 106.
who is very expert at decorating jubilant Radha, who has Him completely under
Her control,


 


43) 107. the edge of whose
garment was clutched by Radha, who won the dice game where Her kiss and His
flute were wagered, and 108. whose heart contains the swiftly moving nectar
stream of love for Sri Radha.


 


44) In this way, her heart maddened
with pure love, the gopi glorified Lord Krsna, the killer of Kamsa. She then
saw Krsna appear before her and she rejoiced with great bliss. 


 


45) O learned readers, with
the Mandara Mountain of your tongues please lovingly churn this ocean of the moon
of pure love (premendu-sagara), which contains 108 names of Lord Krsna.
