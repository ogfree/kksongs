TRANSLATION


1)
Radha and Krsna, the two halves that are the divine couple, meet. One half has
a forehead like the moon. The other half has a forehead like the sun.


 


2) One
half wears an elephant-pearl necklace. The other half wears a forest-flower
garland. One half has a youthful fair form. The other half has a glistening
dark form.


 


3) One
half wears yellow garments. The other half wears a sari of blue. One half wears
valaya bracelets. The other half wears dark cudi bracelets.


 


4) The
two halves of the divine couple stand side-by-side, arm-in-arm. Govinda dasa
says: They are fair and dark, splendid like dark Rahu in the midst of
swallowing the glistening moon.
