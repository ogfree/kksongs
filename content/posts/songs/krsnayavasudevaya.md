TRANSLATION


1)

Â 
Let me therefore offer my respectful 
obeisances
 unto the Lord, who has become the son of 
Vasudeva
, the pleasure of 
Devakī
,
the boy of 
Nanda
 and the other cowherd men of 
Vṛndāvana
, and the enlivener of the cows and the
senses. (Verse 21)




2)

My respectful obeisances are unto You, O Lord, whose
abdomen is marked with a depression like a lotus flower, who are always
decorated with garlands of lotus flowers, whose glance is as cool as the lotus
and whose feet are engraved with lotuses.
 (Verse 22)




3)
 
I wish that all those calamities would happen again
and again so that we could see 
You
 again and again,
for seeing You means that we will no longer see repeated births and deaths.
(Verse 25)




4)
My Lord, Your Lordship can easily be approached, but only by those who are
materially exhausted. 
One
 who is on the path of
[material] progress, trying to improve himself with respectable parentage, great
opulence, high education and bodily beauty, cannot approach You with sincere
feeling. (Verse 26)




5)
And yet others say that 
You
 appeared to rejuvenate the
devotional service of hearing, remembering, worshiping and so on in order that
the conditioned souls suffering from material pangs might take advantage and
gain liberation. (Verse 35)




6)
O Lord of 
Madhu
, as the Ganges forever flows to the
sea without hindrance, let my attraction be constantly drawn unto 
You
 without being diverted to anyone else. (Verse 42)
