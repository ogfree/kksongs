TRANSLATION


1)
O 
Krsna-candra
, now 
You
 are
staying very far away in 
Madhupuri
, in 
Mathura
. But what is the condition of 
Vrndavana
?
All the 
Vrajavasis
, in great pain and distress of
separation, are calling, Â“
Kanu
 (
Krsna
),

Kanu
! Where are 
You
?Â” Even
the birds are calling. But there is no answer, only an echo. All are weeping
and are about to die.


 


2)

Yasoda-maiya
 and 
Nanda
 Baba
are crying so much that it is as if they have become blind and cannot see any
more. They are only sitting and crying. They have no strength and are like
skeletons, unable to even stand up. They are about to die because they are not
cooking. For whom will they cook? And all the cows and Your friends Â– where are
they? Because they cannot hear You calling them on Your flute, the marketplaces
and the roads are all deserted Â– no one is there!


 


3)
Even the bumblebees, which were so busy collecting honey, are now so upset they
have left the flowers. They are crying and rolling on the ground in the pain of
separation. All the trees look so drab and distressed. The peacocks are no
longer dancing, the pigeons are no longer singing, and the cuckoos are silent Â–
they are not calling, Â“
Koohoo
, 
koohoo
,Â”
any more. All are feeling so much pain of separation.


 


4)

Srimati
 
Radharani
 is
burning up in the fever of separation. In all directions, everyone is sinking
in the ocean of separation from You. Even the 
Yamuna
,
whose waters 
arenow
 made of the tears coming from the

gopis
, does not flow anymore. This is the condition
of 
Vrndavana
! 
Govinda
 
dasa
 tells this sad story.
