TRANSLATION


1)
I worship 
Kesava
, who returns from the forest of 
Vraja
 with His ears beautified with earrings made of fresh 
Kadamba
 buds, whose crown is brightened by blooming 
Malati
 flowers and around whose neck a wreath of slightly
blooming 
Yuthika
 flowers is wound.


 


2)
I worship 
Kesava
, who returns from the 
forest
 of 
Vraja
, joyfully wandering amongst His 
surabhi

cows, calling them by name: "
Pisangi
! 
Manikastani
! 
Pranatasrngi
! 
Pingeksane
! 
Mrdanga
 
mukhi
! 
Dhumale
! 
Sabali
! 
Hamsi
! 
Vamsipriye
!"


 


3)
I worship 
Kesava
, who returns from the 
forest
 of 
Vraja
. He is softened by deep love, enjoys sweet joking
conversations and He is the abode of all playful enjoyments. He shines in many
different dresses and laughs at the best jokes that His friends make along the
way.


 


4)
I worship 
Kesava
, who returns from the 
forest
 of 
Vraja
. The leaves that were painted on His cheeks with
mountain minerals are slightly washed away by drops of perspiration and His
curly locks defeat the luster of a cluster of bees.


 


5)
I worship 
Kesava
, who returns from the 
forest
 of 
Vraja
. The cows that eagerly look at their bound up
calves deeply carve the soil with their dancing hooves, and He withholds them
with the soft playing of His flute.


 


6)
I worship 
Kesava
, who returns from the 
forest
 of 
Vraja
, beautifying the roads with His footprints, whose
garland is made grey by the dust thrown up by His herd of restless cows and
whose cloth, scarf and crown are moving along with the waves of the blowing
wind.


 


7)
I worship 
Kesava
, who returns from the 
forest
 of 
Vraja
, where He gladdened the minds of all the cowherd
girls at once with the playful and artful tunes of His 
Murali

flute, which causes them to horripilate of ecstasy within their inner quarters,
and who constantly gives joy to the heart of the queen of 
Vraja
,

Yasoda
.


 


8)
I worship 
Kesava
, who returns from the 
forest
 of 
Vraja
, being worshipped by hundreds of dancing, playful
glances and beautiful smiles of the beautiful girls on the road, and the
corners of whose bee like eyes move restlessly around their bud like breasts.


 


9)
To anyone who nicely recites these eight prayers, that are a festival of bliss
for all the cowherd girls, the friend of 
Visakha
, Sri
Krsna, will give firmly fixed attraction to His lotus feet. Such a pure minded
soul will attain all happiness.
