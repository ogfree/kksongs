TRANSLATION


1) Formerly His hair was
bound in a topknot. Now He has no hair. Rejecting His colorful garments of a
dancing actor, now He wears a 
sannyasiÂ’s
 
kaupina
.


 


2) Formerly He carried a
pot for milking cows. Now He carries a 
sannyasiÂ’s
 
waterpot
. Now His complexion is fair.


 


3) In 
Treta-yuga

He carried an archerÂ’s bow (in the form of Sri 
Rama
).
In 
Dvapara-yuga
 He carried a flute (Sri 
Krsna
). In Kali-
yuga
 He carries a

danda
 (Sri 
Caitanya
 
Mahaprabhu
). Now He is a 
sannyasi
.


 


4) 
Balarama


dasa
 says: O residents of 
Nadiya
,

Balarama
 has become an 
avadhuta
,
and 
Krsna
 has become a 
sannyasi
.

is to be sung in Raga
