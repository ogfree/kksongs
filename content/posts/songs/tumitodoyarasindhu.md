TRANSLATION


1) O Lord, You
are an ocean of mercy.Â  You are the friend of the fallen souls. Please notice
me.Â  I have become like a non devotee, swallowed by the timingila fish of
lust.Â  O Lord, please protect me.


 


2) In every
birth I repeatedly offended You.Â  In every birth I failed to worship You
sincerely. No one is as fallen as I.Â  Nevertheless, You are the only goal of my
life.Â  O Lord of my life, please do not abandon me.


 


3) O Lord, You
are known as Patita-pavana, the deliverer of the fallen, and You are also known
as Syamasundara.Â  Please do not ignore my appeal.Â  Even if I am an offender, I
think that You are the real goal of life.Â  That is the truth.


 


4) O Supreme
Personality of Godhead, please do not neglect me.Â  O master of my life, please
hear my words.Â  Even if I have committed offences to You, I always think of You
as my master.Â  Please allow me to serve You as Your associate and follower.


 


5) Lust has
destroyed my mind.Â  I do not know what is actually beneficial for me.Â  O Lord,
You glance mercifully on all living entities and You are like a desire tree
fulfilling the desires of everyone.Â  Please accept me as Your servant.


 


6) O Lord, You
will not see anyone in these three planetary systems who is as fallen as I.Â  O
Lord, please accept the name "Narottama-pavana" (the deliverer of
Narottama), and let that name be broadcast throughout the material world.Â  O
Lord Syamasundara, O lifter of Govardhana Hill, O deliverer of the fallen,
please accept me as Your servant.


 


7) Narottama
dasa is very unhappy.Â  O Lord please engage him in Your sankirtana movement and
thus make him happy.Â  O Lord, I am very afraid that I will not be able to
overcome the many obstacles that stop me from advancing in devotional service.Â 
O Lord, at every moment I beg You to remove all those obstacles.
