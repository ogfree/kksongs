TRANSLATION


1-10)
To Lord 
Hari
, whose graceful movements rebuke the maddened
elephants, whose handsome teeth condemn the jasmine flowers' pride, whose
handsomeness destroys the pride of millions of 
Kamadevas
,
whose charming face is decorated with the blossom of a splendid smile whose
talkative flute has captured the 
gopis
, whose happily
dancing eyes are red lotus flowers, who enjoys transcendental pastimes that are
a flood of nectar, who is the goal of they who search for the ultimate goal of
life whose footsteps decorate the 
Yamuna's
 shore,
whose handsome feet are worshiped by the kings of all planets, whose soft and
glorious neck is decorated with a 
padaka
, who is
gracefully decorated with 
gorocana
 
tilaka
 whose topknot is decorated with a moving peacock
feather, whose arm defiantly lifted the king of mountains, who made the
courtyard of the king of serpents' expanded hoods into His dancing arena, whose
heart is greedy to enjoy pastimes in the mountain caves, the narration of whose
glories shakes away the age of 
Kali,who
 is a joyful
festival for His affectionate friends, who possesses the strength of all
unconquerable arms, who is the constant companion of 
Balarama

and the cowherd boys, who is a desire tree for the saintly devotees, who is a
new 
Kamadeva
 for the young 
gopis
,
who is the expert protector of they who take shelter of Him, who is the blazing
sun that burns the 
utpala
 flowers of the demons who
holds a bunch of flowers in His lotus hand, who is a lion against the mad
elephant of 
Bakasura
, whose flute 
musi

charms the does, whose voice is more splendid than the singing of cuckoos, who
broke the demon 
yaksas
 in battle, the vine of whose
fame is auspicious for the people, whose holy name and transcendental qualities
are an 
Agastya
 
Muni
 that
drinks up the ocean of repeated birth and death, whose devotees are untouched
by the modes of material nature, whose transcendental qualities are countless,
whose handsome face is the brother of the moon, who is a 
raincloud

against the forest fire of arrogant 
Aristasura
, who
is playful and decorated with charming ornaments, who is a full moon that
destroyed the darkness of 
Vyomasura
, who brought pain
to the demon kings, and who is the delight of His relatives, I offer my
respectful 
obeisances
. 


 


11)
To Lord 
Hari
, who bears the mark of 
Srivatsa
 on His chest, whose splendid garland is the palatial
home of many bees, who is the great auspiciousness of the 
gopis
,
and whose transcendental form is splendid with sandal paste, I offer my
respectful 
obeisances
.
