TRANSLATION


1)
Now 
Krsna
 goes to the forest. He is 
Kamadeva
 personified, 
Kamadeva

who shoots arrows of flowers. His form is splendid like a monsoon cloud. He
bends like the best of dancers. A gentle smile rests on the moon of His face.
His eyes set a trap to catch the teenage 
gopis
' eyes.
He 
play
 the flute at His 
bimbe
-fruit
lips. He enchants the hearts of the three worlds.


 


2)
Flowers adorn His hair, flowers that attract the humming black bees on four
sides. His crown is made of peacock feathers. His shark-shaped earrings swing
to and fro. His glistening large eyes, eyes that reach almost to his ears, are
restless like 
khanjana
 birds. The king of jewels
glistens at His neck. His pearl necklace sways to and fro.


 


3)
About His waist are a yellow cloth and a belt of jangling links. His gait is
graceful and slow, like the king of elephants. His 
kadamba

garland extends to His knees, a garland that maddens the black bees. The soles
of His lotus feet are reddish like the dawn. 
Govinda
 
dasa
 says: Graceful like a blossoming flower, Lord 
Krsna
 delights the heart.
