LYRICS

Adore,
adore ye all The happy day 


Blessed
than heaven Sweeter than May. 


When
he appeared at Puri The holy place, 


My
Lord and Master His Divine Grace.

Oh! my
Master The evangelic angel. 


Give
us Thy light Light up Thy candle.


Struggle
for existence A human race. 


The
only hope His Divine Grace. 


 


(3) 


Misled
we are All going astray, 


Save
us Lord Our fervent pray. 


Wonder
thy ways To turn our face


Adore
Thy feet Your Divine Grace. 


 


(4)


Forgotten
Krsna We fallen souls, 


Paying
most heavy The illusion's toll. 


Darkness
around All untrace. 


The
only hope His Divine
Grace.              



 


(5)


Message
of service Thou hast brought,


A
healthful life As Caitanya wrought. 


Unknown
to all It's full of brace. 


That's
your gift Your Divine Grace.

Absolute

Impersonal
calamity Thou hast moved. 


This
gives us a life Anew and fresh. 


Worship
Thy feet Your Divine Grace.

Had
you not come Who had told 


The
message of Krsna Forceful and bold. 


That's
your right You have the mace 


Save
me a fallen Your Divine Grace. 


 


(8)


The
line of service As drawn by you 


Is
pleasing and healthy Like morning dew. 


The
oldest of all But in new dress 


Miracle
done Your Divine Grace.
