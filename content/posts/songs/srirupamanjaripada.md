LYRICS:


(1)


śrī-rūpa-maÃ±jarī-pada,
sei mora sampada,

sei mor bhajana-pūjana

sei mora prāṇa-dhana, sei mora ābharaṇa,

sei mor jīvanera jīvana


 


(2)


sei
mora rasa-nidhi, sei mora vāÃ±chā-siddhi,

sei mor vedera dharama

sei brata, sei tapa, sei mora mantra-japa,

sei mor dharama-karama


 


(3)


anukūla
habe vidhi, se-pade hoibe siddhi,

nirakhibo e dui nayane

se rūpa-mādhurī-rāśi,
prāṇa-kuvalaya-śaśi,

praphullita habe niśi-dine


 


(4)


tuwā
adarśana-ahi, garale jāralo dehī,

ciro-dina tāpita jīvana

hā hā rūpa koro doyā, deho more pada-chāyā,

narottama loilo śaraṇa


 


WORD
FOR WORD TRANSLATION: 
Sri Rupa Manjari
Pada Sei Mora Sampada


 


TRANSLATION


1)
The lotus feet of Sri Rupa Manjari are my treasure, my devotional service, and
my object of worship. They give my life meaning, and they are the life of my
life.


 


2)
They are the perfection of rasa, and they are perfection worthy of attainment.
They are the very law of the Vedlc scriptures for me. They are the meaning of
all my fasts and penances and my silent uttering of my mantras. They are the
basis of religion and activities.


 


3)
By the purifying process of favorable devotional service one will attain
perfection and with these two eyes be able to see. His transcendental form is
shining like moonlight in my heart, and my heart therefore shines and
reciprocates. In other words, the ordinary moon lights up the night, and its
shine illuminates other objects; but the moon of the effulgence of the form of
Sri Rupa Manjari shines into the heart and makes the heart also shine back to
the spiritual sky. This moon shines not only in the nighttime, but day and
night.


 


4)
Your absence from my vision is like a dose of strong poison, and I will suffer
till the end of my life. Narottama dasa Thakura says: "Please give me your
mercy and the shade of your lotus feet."
