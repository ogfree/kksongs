TRANSLATION


1) Distraught by separation from Lord 
Krsna
, and rapt in meditation on Him, to wash away the
tears from her heart a certain 
gopi
 again and again
spoke these words.


 


2) Lord 
Krsna
 is glorious
like a dark moon. He is bliss personified. He delights the senses. For all of 
Gokula
 He is a festival of bliss. He is the protector of
the cows, the master of the 
gopas
 and 
gopis
, the king of the 
gopas
, and
the master of 
Vraja
.


 


3) Day after day He is always new and young and
fresh. His form is filled with the bliss of new youth. He is the master of
spiritual bliss. He is a treasure-house of eternal bliss.


 


4) To the 
gopis
 He brings
newer and newer bliss. He is a young sprout of sublime bliss. In 
Vrndavana
 He is the master of graceful arts. For 
Vraja
 He is a new sprout of glorious bliss.


 


5) He is a flower that delights the eyes. He is the
fruit of 
Vraja's
 good fortune. At every moment brings
great delight. He is enchanting. He is sweet and splendid.


 


6) He is a flood of nectar. He is handsome. His form
is dark. He is a new youth. He is an ocean of dark nectar.


 


7) He glistens like sapphire. He glistens like black

anjana
. His touch is the delightful touch of a blue
lotus. He glistens like a 
raincloud
.


 


8) His limbs are anointed with camphor, 
aguru
, musk, and 
kunkuma
. A
peacock feather gracefully rests in His curly hair.


 


9) Intoxicated black bees play in His 
parijata
 garland. Numberless autumn full-moons are defeated
by the moon of His face.


 


10) His forehead is glorious with curly hair and
sandal-paste 
tilaka
. His eyebrows curve playfully.
His eyes are languid with bliss.


 


11) From His reddish eyes that reach almost to His
ears, He casts languid glances splashed with waves of graceful charm. His eyes
are restless. He is expert at casting sidelong glances.


 


12) The good fortune of attaining His
sidelong-glance hints makes the heart tremble. His half-closed eyes are
restless. His nostrils are graceful.


 


13) Shark-shaped golden earrings glisten at the edge
of His cheeks. His face shines with cheerfulness. He delights all the worlds.


 


14) The nectar handsomeness of His smile fills the
directions with light. His lips glisten like red 
sindura

or like rubies. 


 


15) His words sweeter than nectar are a glorious
elixir poured into the ears. He gracefully bends His form in three places. 
His tilts His neck.
 He enchants the three worlds.


 


16) He plays sweet melodies on the cooing flute
placed to His pursed lips. His arms and hands glisten with rings, bracelets,
and armlets.


 


17) A golden necklace with a 
Kaustubha

gem rests on His neck. The 
Srivatsa
 mark is manifest
on His chest glorious with a string of pearls.


 


18) His chest is broad. He wears a 
kadamba
 garland. His waist is graceful. He wears yellow
garments. A belt glistens at His waist.


 


19) The edge of His garment is moved to and fro
against His toes. Anklets jangle at His lotus feet.


 


20) His lotus feet are soft and delicate like
reddish new sprouts. The moons of His toenails defeat the glistening moonstone
mirrors.


 


21) His flowerlike feet are glorious with marks of a
flag, thunderbolt, elephant-goad, and lotus. His enchanting handsomeness fills
the three worlds with wonder.


 


22) He is charming playfulness personified. He is a
nectar ocean of jokes and laughter. He enjoys pastimes on the 
Yamuna's
 banks. He is 
Vraja's

hero.


 


23) He is attached to the 
gopis
.
He is like 
Indra
 in 
Vrndavana

forest. He is the 
gopis
' hero more 
dear

than life. He is the crown of all 
Kamadevas
.


 


24) He is a boatman on the 
Yamuna
.
He tries to ferry the 
gopis
 across the river. He
likes to tease 
Radha
. He stays in a 
kadamba
-grove palace.


 


25) He always delights the 
vraja-gopis
'
hearts. He glistens in the 
gopis
' eyes. He tastes the
nectar of blissful pastimes. He is blissful.


 


26) He is marked with musk from the 
gopis
' breasts. He yearns to enjoy pastimes with them. He
hides in a cottage. He is the rake that is 
Radha's

everything.


 


27) He is a black bee sipping nectar from the lotus
flowers of the 
gopis
' faces. In secluded places He
tastes nectar. He is a graceful moon that delights the 
gopis
'
hearts.


 


28) On the 
Yamuna's
 banks
He enjoys blissful pastimes. He is a 
pandita
 in
pastimes of vigorous dancing. For the 
gopis
 He is a
nectar moon where 
Kamadeva
 dances.


 


29) His pastimes fulfill the desires in the wise 
gopis
' hearts. With various stratagems He captures the 
gopis
 in His hands.


 


30) He is a 
kalpa-vrksa

tree. He is the crest jewel of they who taste 
Kamadeva's

nectar. He is more handsome than millions of 
Kamadevas
.
He is more charming and splendid than millions of moons.

loves the 
gopis
. He fulfills the 
gopis
'
desires. He is expert at pastimes of dancing.


 


32) He enchants the hearts of the three worlds. He
is the 
Kamadeva
 of 
Kamadevas
.
He loves the 
gopis
 eternally. 


 


33) For the 
gopis
 whose
every limb is filled with amorous passion, He is 
more dear

than life. In the 
rasa
 dance He is wild with bliss.
He is the rake that enjoys pastimes with 
Radha
.


 


34) He is exhausted from amorous pastimes.
Perspiration anoints his face. He languidly rests in a 
gopi's

embrace. He is handsome and glorious. The 
Malaya
 breezes serve
Him.


 


35) Anyone who reads to himself or reads aloud so
others may hear
,
 this nectar elixir of love for the
master of that 
gopis
' life will fall in love with 
Krsna
. He will meet 
Krsna
. That
is certain.
