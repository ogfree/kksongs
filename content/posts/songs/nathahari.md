TRANSLATION


1)
O my master, Hari! O Lord of the Universe, Hari! Srimati Radharani is in Her
hiding spot woefully awaiting for you.


 


2)
While She is alone, She fantasies that You are everywhere She sees. You sip the
honey from Her lips, as if She was actually there.


 


3)
The poem of Jayadeva Goswami describes the loving exchange between Radha and
Krsna. May this poem be enjoyed by the devotees of rasika bhava.
