TRANSLATION


(Refrain)
I gaze at Him with my eyes. The puppet of my life-breath is tossed to and fro
by the waves of His smiles. I gaze at Him. I worship His youthful grace.


 


1)
The sandal-paste-moon on His forehead is a trap to charm and catch beautiful
girls. It is effulgence that lights up the darkness. He is a 
raincloud
 where rests a full moon that lights up the night.


 


2)
His hair is graceful. The ten moons of His fingernails dance as He plays His
wonderful flute. When I gaze at His face, my heart is filled with bliss. I am
overcome. How can I forget Him?


 


3)
Now that I have once seen His handsome form, I find that piety, good character,
and all else have fled from my heart. In his heart 
Govinda


dasa
 prays that in this way he may also fall in love
with Lord 
Krsna
.
