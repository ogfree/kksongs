TRANSLATION


1)
We will now consider the science of Vaikuntha, which should be known by the
learned. In the beginning it should be understood that there is no difference
between the energy and the energetic. Nothing is gained if we consider the
Absolute Truth as devoid of energy, therefore it is the duty of swanlike
persons to accept the existence of His energies. Energy is never a truth
separate from the energetic Supreme Lord. Although proper examples to illustrate
the Absolute Truth are unavailable in this material world, indirect examples
are sometimes found. Just as fire and heat cannot exist separately, the
Absolute Truth and His energies do not exist separately.


 


2)
The Absolute Truth is manifested through the inconceivable superior energy of
the energetic Absolute Truth, who is the source of the purushavataras and is
realized through samadhi. If heat was separated from fire, then due to an
absence of energy, fire would not exist. Similarly, if energy was separated
from the Absolute Truth, then the Absolute Truth would not exist.


 


3)
The superior energy of the Absolute Truth is realized in three different
aspectsÂ—sandhini, samvit, and hladini. The first manifestation of the Absolute
Truth is sat (sandhini), cit (samvit), and ananda (hladini). Â“In the beginning
there was only the Supreme Brahman, then, after manifesting His energies, He
became known as sat-cid-ananda,Â”Â—this kind of misconception arises due to
consideration of material time and should not applied on the Absolute Truth. It
is understood by swanlike people that the sat-cid-ananda form of the Lord is
beginningless, endless, and eternal. The sandhini energy manifests the
existence of the eternal abode, name, form, associates, relationships, features,
and foundation of the Absolute Truth. The superior energy of the Lord has three
potencies, namely cit, or spiritual, jiva, or marginal, and acit, or material.
The spiritual potency, cit, is His internal potency. The marginal and material
potencies are separated. These potencies are considered according to the
proportion of the energy manifest. Vaikuntha is the abode of the spiritual
potency of the sandhini aspect of the superior energy.


 


4)
The names of Krsna manifest from the abhidha-satta, the body of Krsna manifests
from the rupa-satta, and the lovers of Krsna like Radha manifest from a mixture
of the rupa-satta and sangini-satta.


 


5)
All kinds of relationships manifest from the sandhini aspect. The sandhini
aspect of the Lord is the source of all spiritual manifestations and features.


 


6)
The samvit aspect of the superior energy consists of knowledge and its
practical application (jnana and vijnana). When samvit interacts with the
manifestations of the sandhini aspect, all emotions appear.


 


7)
Without the presence of emotions, existence would be unknown. Therefore all
truths are illuminated by samvit. All the emotions of Vaikuntha are created by
the samvit aspect of the spiritual potency.


 


8)
All relationships in Vaikuntha have been established by Samvitdevi, who is the
director of action and inaction. The different rasas, such as shanta and dasya,
and the respective activities in those rasas have been established by samvit.


 


9)
If one does not accept the quality of variegatedness, then Samvitdevi manifests
for him the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth. The living entity then
takes shelter of impersonal knowledge of Brahman. Therefore impersonal
knowledge of Brahman is only the impersonal consideration of Vaikuntha. For one
who accepts the quality of variegatedness, Samvitdevi manifests the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. The living entity then accepts the devotional service
of the Lord.


 


10)
When the spiritual potency of the superior energy interacts with the hladini
aspect, it creates attachment up to the state of mahabhava, in which She
(hladini) bestows the topmost ecstasy.


 


11)
This hladini is Sri Radhika, who is the energy of the energetic, who possesses
the topmost loving sentiments, and who is half of the Supreme Lord's form. She
expands into the indescribable forms of Krsna's inconceivable happiness.


 


12)
That Radha gives pleasure to Krsna. She is the embodiment of mahabhava. There
are eight varieties of emotions that nourish the rasa of hladini. They are
known as Radha's eight sakhis.


 


13)
When the hladini energy of the living entities realizes a portion of the
spiritual hladini by the association of devotees and the mercy of the Lord,
then the living entities become eternally happy and attain the stage of pure
eternal sentiments while remaining individual entities.


 


14)
The sandhini, samvit, and hladini energies are eternally situated in Sri Krsna,
the Supreme Personality of Godhead; that is, existence, knowledge, and
attachment are in perfect harmony in Him. Yet these three energies are also
present in His personal expansions in His Vaikuntha pastimes.


 


15)
Although many variegated qualities are eternally manifest in Sri Krsna, He
wonderfully remains nirguna, devoid of material qualities, because His
qualities are the interactions of His spiritual potency and are forms of His
spiritual opulence.


 


16)
After concluding the consideration on the sandhini, samvit, and hladini aspects
of the spiritual potency of the superior energy, I will now explain the
sandhini, samvit, and hladini aspects of the marginal potency of the superior
energy. The living entities are created by the will of the Lord and by the
inconceivable superior energy of the Lord. The living entities have been
awarded minute independence, so they are classified as separated truths and
their activities are said to be separated from the Lord's activities.


 


17)
Krsna is like the spiritual sun, and the living entities are like the atomic
particles of that incomparable sun's rays. Therefore all the qualities of Krsna
are naturally present in the living entities.


 


18)
Although it is inappropriate to compare the greatness of the Lord's qualities
with the ocean or the earth, if we do consider His qualities in this way, then
the qualities of the living entities appear like drops of the ocean or dust
particles of the earth.


 


19)
The three aspectsÂ—hladini, sandhini, and samvitÂ—are fully manifest in Sri
Krsna, but they are also minutely present in the living entities. This is
understood by persons endowed with fine intelligence.


 


20)
All living entities have independence that was awarded by the Lord, yet those
who desire auspiciousness naturally remain under the subordination of Krsna.


 


21)
Those who are unable to recognize what is auspicious and what is inauspicious
and who engage in sense gratification do not accept subordination under the
spiritual potency and thus live independently. They traverse the path of
fruitive activities while wandering in the material world, which is difficult
to leave after once entering.


 


22)
For those living entities who traverse the path of fruitive activities, the
Lord, as His pastime, accompanies them in the form of the Supersoul.


 


23)
The pastimes of the Lord and the living entities appear mundane to the
conditioned souls. The living entities enjoy the results of their fruitive
activities, while the Supersoul awards those results.


 


24)
When the marginal potency of the superior energy interacts with sandhini, the
upper heavenly planets are created.


 


25)
Fruitive activities, the results of fruitive activities, distress, happiness,
sin, piety, and all desires are also created by this interaction with sandhini.
The functions of the subtle bodies are also created by this interaction.
Svarloka, Janaloka, Tapoloka, Satyaloka, and Brahmaloka are all created by this
interaction. Even the lower hellish planets are understood to be created by
this interaction with sandhini.


 


26)
When the marginal potency of the superior energy interacts with samvit, it
manifests knowledge of the Absolute Truth. By this knowledge a living entity
realizes the Supersoul. This knowledge is distinct from and inferior to
impersonal knowledge of Brahman, which is manifested by the interaction of the
spiritual potency of the superior energy with samvit.


 


27)
Renunciation, in the form of neglecting maya, manifests from this interaction
of samvit with the marginal energy. Sometimes the living entities consider the
happiness of realizing the self as insignificant and the happiness of realizing
the Supersoul as relatively superior, and they therefore desire to merge with
the Supersoul.


 


28)
When the marginal potency of the superior energy interacts with hladini, it
manifests devotional service to the Supreme Lord. This devotional service
nullifies the material conception of the Lord and establishes Him as nirakara,
or formless.


 


29)
The rati, or attachment, of the spiritual potency is different from this type
of devotional service of the Supreme Lord. Therefore this devotional service of
the Lord is naturally dry, or without rasa, and is not based on love.


 


30)
The prayers of those who perform this type of devotional service are mixed with
gratefulness, therefore this cannot be called unmotivated devotional service.
Rather, their prayers are filled with desires for material advancement or
renunciation.


 


31)
Although sometimes tears are shed out of emotion while executing this type of
devotional service, such persons' emotions for Sri Krsna, who enjoys spiritual
pastimes, do not arise.


 


32)
Does this mean that there is no superior emotion in the hearts of the
conditioned souls than this form of devotional service? Certainly there is.
Just as Sri Krsna performs His pastimes in Vaikuntha with the eternally perfect
living entities, He certainly performs pastimes in relationship with the
conditioned souls.


 


33)
Those who consider the happiness of the hladini aspect of the marginal potency
as insignificant and consider the impersonal Brahman as incomplete understand
that the pastimes of Krsna with the spiritual potency of the superior energy
are more relishable, so they join those pastimes. They are qualified for
receiving the highest happiness. They are servants of the Lord and are under
the protection of the spiritual potency. They derive no fruits whatsoever from
impersonal knowledge of Brahman or yoga. In this context, yoga refers to
devotional service (as described above in verses 28-31), as practiced by the
living entities. Regarding impersonal knowledge of Brahman, please refer to
verse 9 of this chapter. Therefore when yogis and jnanis become fortunate, they
engage in spiritual activities.


 


34)
After completing discussions on the marginal potency, I will now discuss the
sandhini, samvit, and hladini aspects of maya-shakti, the external potency. All
inert matter is manifested from the external potency of the superior energy.
Therefore this maya potency converts spiritual characteristics into material
characteristics. Maya, the external potency, covers the living entities, so she
is the mother of illusion and a maidservant of the Supersoul.


 


35)
After carefully studying the nature of maya, it is concluded to be the most
inferior potency in the whole creation, because all of the living entities'
inauspiciousness is created by maya. If maya did not exist, there would be no
degradation of the living entities in the form of aversion to the Lord.
Therefore many people doubt whether maya is the Lord's energy, because the
Supreme Lord is all-auspicious and unaffected by sin. Those who understand the
Supreme Lord as the supreme doer and controller do not accept any truth that is
contrary to Him; they thus accept maya as the material potency of the Supreme
Lord's spiritual energy. The external potency, which is a reflection or shadow
of the spiritual potency, is not independent. By the will of the Lord, maya is
the perverted reflection of, and therefore certainly subordinate to, the Lord's
spiritual potency. In this context one should not accept the Mayavadi
philosophers' meanings of bimba (reflection), pratibimba (reflected image), and
praticchaya (shadow).


 


36)
If we consider the existence of maya, we can conclude that this world is the
shadow of Vaikuntha, which is created by the spiritual potency of the superior
energy of the Lord and is full of variegatedness. The example of the moon in
water is applicable to this shadow [the material world]. But this world is not
false in the same way as the moon in the water is false. As maya is in fact a
potency of the superior energy, whatever is created by her is also a fact.


 


37)
As far as the work of the maidservant [Maya] is concerned, learned people say
that this material world is her creation. This material existence is able to
bind the living entities as part of the Lord's pastimes (please see verses
22-23 of this chapter).


 


38)
Just as the original, pure condition of an object is not manifest in its
shadow, we do not find the pleasantness of the spiritual world in the material
world, which is created by maya, rather we find the perverted quality,
distress.


 


39)
When the external potency of the superior energy interacts with sandhini, it
spreads conceptions of nationalism. This mentality is found only in this world.
The symptoms of this conception are spread through forms and their expansions.
If one could ascertain Vaikuntha by one's thoughts, then the material forms and
their expansions would certainly be useful. But the science of Vaikuntha is
beyond the realm of material space, time, and argument and is realized through
samadhi. Actually all the forms and expansions that are seen in Vaikuntha, the
abode of transcendental pastimes, are all spiritual and auspicious. It should
be known that the forms and expansions of the material world, the perverted
reflection of the spiritual world, are forever devoid of bliss.


 


40)
The activities and bodies of the conditioned living entities are material and
limited and are meant for performing work and enjoying its results. They are
created by the sandhini aspect of the external potency. If one tries to
understand words like Â“tinyÂ” and Â“atomicÂ” in descriptions of the living
entities and Â“greatnessÂ” in descriptions of the Supreme Lord in terms of
material space, then one will not attain knowledge of the Absolute Truth.


 


41)
When the external potency of the superior energy interacts with samvit, it
creates the subtle body of conditioned souls in the form of intelligence and
false ego. The constitutional position of a pure living entity is beyond the
gross and subtle bodies. The samvit aspect of the external potency is known in
the scriptures as nescience. Due to this nescience, the gross and subtle bodies
of the living entities are created. When pure living entities reside in
Vaikuntha, the first knot of nescience, in the form of false ego, does not
entangle them. Pure living entities cannot remain steady after giving up
spiritual activities. Therefore as soon as the living entities become situated
in their own happiness through the minute independence given by the Lord, they
become shelterless and are compelled to take shelter of Maya. On account of
this, pure living entities have no shelter other than Vaikuntha. The living
entities of Vaikuntha are very insignificant, like fireflies in comparison to
the powerful sunlike Lord. As soon as the living entity leaves Vaikuntha, he is
simultaneously awarded a subtle body and thrown into the material world,
created by Maya. All manifestations of the sandhini, samvit, and hladini
aspects of the marginal potency are mixed with maya as soon as the living
entity leaves the shelter of Vaikuntha. When one considers material existence
as his own, this is called false ego. Absorption in this false ego is the
function of the heart, cultivating material sense objects through the heart is
the function of the mind, and realization through this cultivation is called
material knowledge. The mind, being superior to the senses, manifests as the
functions of the senses in their association. When the impression of contact
between the senses and sense objects is established within, it is protected by
the strength of remembrance. When one cultivates those protected memories by
following the process of elaborating and condensing them, then whatever one
conjectures is called argument. By this argument, knowledge of sense objects
and related items is acquired.


 


42)
The samvit aspect of the external energy creates the intelligence of the heart,
the feelings of the senses, the remembrance of the mind, and the knowledge of
sense objects.


 


43)
Knowledge of sense objects is completely mundane. It has nothing to do with
one's constitutional duties. It is called material knowledge because it is
connected with the qualities of the material world.


 


44)
The hladini aspect of the external energy manifests as attachment for material
objects. That attachment spreads the conception of enjoyment in the form of
happiness derived from fruitive activities. Attachment for the material world,
the endeavor for material prosperity, and the desire for sense gratification
all naturally arise from this attachment to sense objects. In order to maintain
life peacefully, the four castesÂ—brahmana, kshatriya, vaishya, and shudraÂ—are
established according to people's natural characteristics, and the four
ashramasÂ—grihastha, vanaprastha, brahmacari, and sannyasiÂ—are established
according to people's position. According to necessity, constitutional and
conditional occupational duties are ascribed. When the upper and lower planets,
which are created by the sandhini aspect of the marginal potency (see verses
24-25), are connected with the results of these duties, then they become the
object of the fruitive workers' hopes or fears. It is to be mentioned at this
point that the samvit and hladini aspects of the marginal potency, being almost
covered by the samvit and hladini aspects of the external potency, time to time
manifest renunciation and knowledge of the self, which are ultimately overcome
by maya due to the absence of spiritual activities.


 


45)
The Supersoul is perceived at this point as Yajnesvara, the Lord of sacrifice.
People of the material world try to please Him by their activities, and they
worship Him by sacrifices. The name of this religion is trivarga, or dharma,
artha, and kama. But there is no possibility of moksha, or liberation, by this
path.
