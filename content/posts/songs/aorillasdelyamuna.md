LYRICS:


(1)


A
orillas del Yamuna, bajo Ã¡rboles kadamba


di
Â¡oh, sakhi! que pasa


EstÃ¡
Syam con Su flauta, la mente asÃ­ conquista


y a Su
rasa lila invita


 


(2)


En un
loto de ocho pÃ©talos


Sri
Radha Sri Hari con las ocho sakhis


 


(3)


Con
bello canto y baile, las sakhis festejan


la
adorable pareja


Krsna
lila embelesa, con su natural belleza


que al
bosque entero encanta


 


(4)


Voy a
dejar mi casa por ir a esos kunjas


con la
dulzura del rasa


Libre
del lazo familiar, adoro al rey de Vraj


Vinod
esto ha decidido


 


TRANSLATION


1) Oh sakhi!
My dear girlfriend! What have I seen today? In a kadamba grove on the banks of
the Yamuna, a beautiful blackish boy holding a long flute (vamsi) is seated
upon a throne of jewels, performing His pastimes as the King of all
transcendental mellows!


 


2)
Situated upon the eight petals of the jeweled altar is Sri Radha and Sri Hari
surrounded by Their attendants the eight chief gopis. There Krsna performs His
amorous pastimes which are just like a waterfall of nectar.


 


3) By
singing sweet songs and by dancing nicely, all the gopis satisfy the treasured
Divine Couple. Thus I am beholding Krsna's pastimes with His beautiful female
consorts expanding throughout the splendorous forest.


 


4) For
the sake of the mellows of such pastimes, I will not go to my home, but I will
instead enter into the forest. Renouncing all shyness due to fear of family
members, just worship the Lord of Vraja. This is the humble submission of
Bhaktivinoda.
