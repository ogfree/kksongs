Emona
Durmati


 


TRANSLATION


1) Oh
Lord! Such a wicked mind has brought me into this world, but one of Your pure
and elevated devotees has come to bring me out of it.


 


2) He
saw me so fallen and wretched, took pity, and came to me saying, Â“O humbled
soul, please listen to this good tiding, for it will gladden your heart.


 


3)
Â“Sri Krsna Caitanya has appeared in the land of Navadvipa to deliver you. He
has safely conducted many miserable souls such as you across the sea of worldly
existence.Â”


 


4) Â“To
fulfill the promise of the Vedas, the son of a brahmana bearing the name
Mahaprabhu of golden complexion, has descended with His brother the avadhuta
Nityananda. Together They have overwhelmed all of Nadia with divine ecstasy.Â”


 


5)
Â“Sri Caitanya, who is Krishna Himself, the son of Nanda, has saved the world by
freely distributing His own holy name. Go also and receive your deliverance.Â”


 


6) O
Lord, hearing those words, Bhaktivinoda has come weeping to the soles of Your
lotus feet and tells the story of his life.
