TRANSLATION 

1) I offer 
pranama
 to 
Nandanandana
,
whose face is extremely delightful, in whose beautiful ears hang jeweled
earrings, and whose entire body is anointed with fragrant 
candana
.



2) I offer 
pranama
 to 
Nandanandana
,
whose eyes are more beautiful than the fully bloomed lotus, whose head is
beautifully adorned with an arrangement of peacock feathers, and who enchants
millions of Cupids.



3) I offer 
pranama
 to 
Nandanandana
,
from whose beautiful nose hangs an elephant-pearl, whose teeth are immensely
effulgent, whose bodily complexion is more beautiful and lustrous than a fresh
rain cloud.



4) I offer 
pranama
 to 
Nandanandana
,
whose lotus hands hold the flute, whose lingering gait defeats even that of an
impassioned elephant, and whose dark limbs are beautified by a yellow shawl.



5) I offer 
pranama
 to 
Nandanandana
,
whose threefold-bending posture is exquisitely elegant, the effulgence of whose
toe-nails put to shame even the moon, and who wears invaluable jewels and
ornaments.



6) I offer 
pranama
 to 
Nandanandana
,
whose body exudes an especially beautiful fragrance, and whose broad chest is
adorned with the 
kaustubha
 jewel and the mark of 
srivatsa
.



7) I offer 
pranama
 to 
Nandanandana
,
the expert lover of 
Vrindavana
 who performs
immaculate pastimes and who is attired in clothes which are suitable for those
pastimes, and who pulverized the pride of 
Indra
.



8) I offer 
pranama
 to 
Nandanandana
,
who as the lover of the 
Vraja
 
gopis

perpetually delights them and who enchants the minds of all living entities.



9) Whoever regularly recites this (Sri 
Nanda-nandanastakam
)
will easily cross the seemingly insurmountable ocean of material existence and
attain eternal residence at the lotus feet of 
Krishna
.
