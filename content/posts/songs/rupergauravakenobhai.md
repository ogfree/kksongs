TRANSLATION


1)
Oh mind, my dear friend, why is your bodily beauty such an object of your proud
vanity? This body is temporary, and there is no certainty whatsoever of permanence.
After 
Yamaraja
 has paid his visit and taken your soul
away, this body will then become cold. The eyes will remain motionless, and in
the fiery funeral pyre it will simply turn into ashes.


 


2)
Mind, you repeatedly behold the lovely handsomeness of this face, which is your
favorite object of constant vanity. It will simply become delicious food for
dogs and jackals. At that time, where will you keep all the decorative
ornaments and valuable clothes which you appreciate with such high esteem?


 


3)
Your beloved wife, sons and friends will take you to the crematorium, and after
burning you they will simply return back to their homes. You belong to whom?
And 
whom
 belongs to you? Now just try to grasp the
essential significance of all this. That is, the destruction of this temporary
body will definitely come to pass.


 


4)
My dear mind, if you really want the eternal, auspicious way of life, then just
sing aloud the glories of the Lord always and everywhere. Also, one should
certainly chant 
Harinama
 
japa

at all times. Abandoning all useless arguments, dear mind, just worship 
Krsna
, for such worship is certainly the only shelter of 
Bhaktivinoda
.
