own sins and consequently burn incessantly within the great forest fire of the
material world. Blessed is the Lord who is a vast ocean of divine generosity,
the abode of the sweet nectars that are the holy names of Krsna. 


 


2)
The luster of the LordÂ’s fair body is brighter than a million brilliant mirrors
of gold. Of such sweetness is the fragrance of His body that the aromatic lotus
and parijata flowers humbly offer their prayers of worship. Millions of Cupids,
shocked out of their pride, have swooned at His lotus feet, unable to bear the
sight of His unparalleled beauty. His limbs are alive with the rasa moods of
love that emerge and flow continually from His beautiful form. I sing with joy
the unending glories of my sweet Lord, my golden Gaurasundara, the one and only
divine abode of pure love. 


 


3)
The Lord expanded Himself as the five-fold potencies of Panca-tattva to
expedite the free distribution of the holy names of Krsna. The holy names lead
to Krsna-prema, the fifth goal of life. Fully equipped with transcendental
limbs and divine weapons, and accompanied by His associates, the Lord descended
on earth in all His opulence. Being the Supreme Lord Syamasundara Himself, He
appeared as Gaurasundara, dancing and singing the holy names in ecstasy through
the streets of Nadiya like an ordinary citizen. I sing with joy the unending
glories of my golden Gaurasundara, my sweet Lord, the one and only divine abode
of pure love. 


 


4)
The Lord could not bear to see His devotee Advaita Prabhu, Lord of Santipura,
in misery over the pitiable condition of the Kali-yuga, which has been
overtaken by irreligious philosophies. He therefore appeared in such a form to
relieve the jiva from misery, award happiness to His devotee, and destroy the
venom of Kali by profusely distributing the nectar of KrsnaÂ’s names. I sing
with joy the unending glories of my golden Gaurasundara the beautiful, the one
and only divine abode of pure love. 


 


5)
The LordÂ’s divine birth and pastimes took place at Sri Navadvipa, on the banks
of the holy Ganga. He blessed the house of Srinivasa (Srivasa-angana), filling the
hearts of all with the blissful transcendental mellows of the holy name. He
dutifully respected and adored His mother, Sacidevi, and learned father, Sri
Misra. To His wives, Sri Laksmipriya and Sri Visnupriya, He was the Lord of
their lives. I sing with joy the unending glories of Gaurasundara the
beautiful, my golden Lord, the one and only divine abode of pure love. 


 


6)
As the son of Sacidevi, the Lord enjoyed mischievous childhood pastimes with
other boys. As a mere youth He acquired mastery over all scriptures. By His
expertise in the current method of logic, He established the auspicious path of
devotion for the welfare of all. On the banks of the Ganga in the company of
His students, He vanquished the pride of the famous digvijayi pandita (conquering
scholar). I sing with joy the unending glories of my golden Gaurasundara, the
Lord of beauty, the one and only abode of divine love. 


 


7)
The LordÂ’s childhood pastimes were most wonderful. He used to play merrily with
rejected utensils and inauspicious animals like pups and poisonous snakes. He
was once carried away by a thief who wanted to steal His clothes. He appeared
before a tirtha vipra (a brahmana who constantly visits holy places) and
blessed him with the remnants of His food. When He would cry in frustration,
only the utterance of the names of Krsna would at once pacify Him. I sing with
joy the unending glories of my Gaurasundara, my sweet Lord, the one and only
divine abode of love. 


 


8)
The Lord would play wonderfully in a variety of ways with His boyhood friends
while bathing in the waters of the Ganga. Sometimes in a jovial mood He would
speak sweetly with the young girls as if teasing them. He would present
complicated arguments and counter-arguments before His puzzled students and
teachers. I sing with joy the unending glories of my golden Gaurasundara, my
sweet Lord, the one and only divine abode of love. 


 


9)
The Lord was respected all over the land as the learned scholar Nimai Pandita.
He would crush the ego of the proud Nyaya scholars of His time by His numerous
ingenious and original arguments. After shattering their traditional theories,
He would again establish them. I sing with joy the unending glories of my
golden Gaurasundara, Lord of my heart, the one and only abode of divine love. 


 


10)
The Lord pointed out the defects of ornamental grammar in the verses
spontaneously composed and recited in praise of the goddess Ganga by the most
celebrated scholar Kesava Kasmiri. When the scholar tried to defend himself
with many complicated arguments, even those arguments were defeated by the
Lord. Although the Lord had humbled the pandita by checking his hasty
intellect, the Lord nonetheless gave him all due respects and honor as a
learned Sanskrit scholar. I sing with joy the unending glories of my golden
Gaurasundara, my loving Lord, the one and only abode of divine love.


 


11)
His wonderful elaborate explanations of the sutras, short but potent Sanskrit
aphorisms, were extremely intricate. He thereby brought out the sutrasÂ’ natural
meanings and diverse aspects. He proved that essentially the dhatus (the seven
thousand root sounds of Sanskrit) in their fullest meaning express the energies
of Krsna, the sole supporter of all the universes. Scholars were thereby
totally perplexed and unable to assert their conclusions before the Lord. They
could simply sit before Him in dumbfounded astonishment. I sing with joy the
unending glories of my beloved Lord, my golden Gaurasundara, the one and only
abode of divine love. 


 


12)
The Lord explained that the meanings and relationships of all sounds of speech
(sphota-vada) have been revealed by the single action of Lord KrsnaÂ’s glance.
The sphota-vada scholars weave their grammatical rules around sphota, but
factually KrsnaÂ’s sweet will is the only basis for grammatical rules. The
ultimate purpose of all subtle and gross energies and their interactions is to
provide pleasure to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Krsna, as an aspect
of His transcendental pastimes. I sing with joy the unending glories of my
golden Lord, Gaurasundara the beautiful, the divine abode of pure love. 


 


13)
After the LordÂ’s return from Gaya, He could not resume His academic pursuits
because of the continuous upsurge of divine love within His heart. His
students, forever deprived of the opportunity to study under Nimai Pandita,
condemned themselves as fallen and unfortunate.With intense imploring humility,
they praised the Lord for His extraordinary genius as a teacher. Seeing the
students thus, the Lord felt great compassion and blessed them. Overwhelmed
with ecstatic love, He announced the first good tidings of Sri Krsna
sankirtana: He led them in singing the glories of Lord Krsna, and they
accompanied the chanting by clapping their hands. All directions became
immersed in the sea of nectar that flowed from this ecstatic kirtana. I sing
with joy the unending glories of my golden Lord, Gaurasundara the beautiful,
the divine abode of pure love. 


 


14)
The Lord honors the Vedic religious principles and has taken shelter of His guruÂ’s
instruction to introduce Krsna kirtana. He is ever absorbed in His ecstatic
dance of divine love, accompanied by musical instruments amid the singing and
dancing of millions upon millions of devotees. He is the only savior of sinful
and evil-minded demons who are responsible for the decline of religion and
pious activities in the world. I sing with joy the unending glories of my
loving master, Gaurasundara the beautiful, my golden Lord, the divine abode of
pure love. 


 


15)
When the king of mlecchas (Chand Kazi) obstructed the performance of hari-nama,
the Lord removed the fears of His devotees by directing a nocturnal sankirtana
procession, decorated with hundreds of thousands of lamps and millions of
voices singing the holy name. Dancing to the accompaniment of the sweet sound
of the sri mrdanga, karatalas, and other musical instruments, the Lord humbled
the ruling Kazi and ultimately won his heart. I sing with joy the unending
glories of my loving Gaurasundara, my golden Lord, the divine abode of pure
love. 


 


(16)
Amid the showering of sorrowful tears from millions of eyes, the Lord gladly
cut off His beautiful long hair. As He accepted His danda, millions of voices
were singing the glories of Krsna. Thereafter the people of all lands cried out
desperately in grief when they saw Him in the dress of a sannyasi. I sing with
joy the unending glories of my golden Lord, Gaurasundara the beautiful, the
divine abode of pure love. 


 


17)
Being the Lord of all yogis, He wandered all over the Radha province (Bengal)
as a devotee, thus sanctifying the land with His lotus feet. He was known as
Krsna Caitanya and rescued all fallen conditioned souls with the names of
Krsna. He ran all over the earth just like a madman, intoxicated with
transcendental ecstatic loving emotions. His appearance resembled a mountain of
gold. I sing with joy the unending glories of my loving Gaurasundara, my golden
Lord, the divine abode of pure love. 


 


18)
The LordÂ’s association of devotees became even more prestigious by the presence
of exalted personalities like Sri Gadadhara and Sri Nityananda. The Lord
descended on earth to fulfill the desires of Advaita Acarya, the foremost of
devotees. To please His mother, the Lord promised that He would not go far away
from her but remain close by at Purusottama Ksetra (Jagannatha Puri). I sing
with joy the unending glories of my loving Gaurasundara the beautiful, my
golden Lord, the divine abode of pure love. 


 


19)
When the Lord of sannyasis reached Nilacala, He first delivered Vasudeva
Sarvabhauma, the famous pandita of Vedanta, and then proceeded to southern
India, home of many followers of different philosophies. There, like a desire
tree, He fulfilled the wishes of the devotees living at various holy places. He
met Ramananda Raya, who was like a raincloud of devotion, and empowered him to
shower everywhere VrndavanaÂ’s mellows of spontaneous loving service
(raga-bhakti). I sing with joy the unending glories of my loving Gaurasundara,
my golden Lord, the divine abode of pure love. 


 


20)
The LordÂ’s original and ever-fresh arguments (delineating the real conclusions
of the Vedas) devastated the repeated attempts of Sarvabhauma (by means of
chala, vitanda, nigraha, and other techniques) to establish vivarta-vada, the
impersonal and atheistic philosophy of Sankara. Vivarta-vada is supported by
proud men with a demoniac and evil mentality. The Lord preached instead that
the entire complex of the Vedic scriptures must be viewed as a temple
enshrining Krsna-bhakti. I sing with joy the unending glories of my loving
Gaurasundara, my golden Lord, the divine abode of pure love. 


 


21)
The LordÂ’s divine figure, the dwelling place of sweet love, is embellished by
beautifully sharp features and well formed limbs. It greatly increases the
pleasure of the demigods. Lovelier than the moon, His tall effulgent figure
mocks the beauty of hundreds of golden lotus flowers. He embodies the
ever-fresh moods of transcendental goodness and loving ecstasy that arise from
dancing and singing the holy names. I sing with joy the unending glories of my
golden Lord, Gaurasundara the beautiful, the divine abode of pure love. 


 


22)
The LordÂ’s pilgrimage to South India was for rescuing the residents there. At
roadsides, temples, and holy sanctuaries, He would chant in sweet tunes, Â“krsna
krsna krsna krsna krsna krsna krsna he!Â” Sometimes, carried away by some
indescribable divine exultation, He would sing Â“rama ramaÂ” and dance sweetly in
ecstatic rhythm. He would deliver one and all, irrespective of time, place or
circumstance, by magnanimously inducing them to chant the holy names of Krsna.
I sing with joy the unending glories of my golden Lord Gaurasundara, the divine
abode of pure love. 


 


23)
In the LordÂ’s famous conversation with Ramananda Raya, known as Ramananda
Samvada in Sri Caitanya-caritamrta, He concluded that the most cherished
possession is raga-bhakti, or spontaneous loving service to the Lord. This
service is rendered with a heart thoroughly cleansed of jnana (knowledge) and
karma (fruitive activities). The Lord also concluded that Krsna, the master of
parakiya conjugal love, is the only basis, the singular objective, and the sole
recipient of bhava-seva, or ecstatic loving service. I sing with joy the
unending glories of my golden Lord, Gaurasundara the beautiful, the divine
abode of pure love. 


 


24)
The Lord showed that one may serve Krsna in variegated devotional
relationships, progressing in excellence from servitude to friendship to
parenthood and to conjugal love. And He showed that ultimately pure devotional
service to the lotus feet of Srimati Radharani in mood of sweet parakiya
conjugal love for Vrajendra Nandana is the most beautiful service. Divine and
spontaneous loving desires in the most pure and pristine form can have their
full meaning only in Sri Vrajendra Nandana, Sri Krsna in Vraja Dhama. Such
inspiration was given by Sriman Mahaprabhu. I sing with joy the unending
glories of my golden Lord, Gaurasundara the beautiful, the divine abode of pure
love. 


 


25)
The Lord explained that a devotee in the mood of passive adoration enjoys the
pleasure of liberation from suffering. A devotee in the service mood enjoys the
pleasure of contentment in service. A devotee in friendship enjoys the pleasure
of serving the Lord directly under His shelter. And a devotee in a parental
relationship enjoys intense affection for the Lord as a son. The Lord further
revealed that the devotee in svakiya (marital) conjugal love is restricted in
enjoying the sweet nectars and full nourishment of madhurya (conjugal love)
because of the impositions of scriptural injunctions. However, when service in
madhurya becomes free of the bindings of scriptural regulations and is full of
the parakiya (adulterous) conjugal loving moods of Vraja, especially when the
element vamya (contrariness) is added, such service gives Krsna the greatest
pleasure. I sing with joy the unending glories of my golden Lord, Gaurasundara
the beautiful, the divine abode of pure love. 


 


26)
The Lord revealed to the fortunate Sri Raya how He had personally descended to
perform His ever-fresh divine pastimes at Navadvipa. When Ramananda beheld the
LordÂ’s own form as the cowherd boy Syamasundara, appearing with the nature of
mysterious love in the mood and luster of Sri Radhika, he fell down unconscious
before the lotus feet of the Lord. The kind Lord then restored the
consciousness of His eternally surrendered servant. I sing with joy the
unending glories of my golden Lord, Gaurasundara the beautiful, the divine
abode of pure love. 


 


27)
At Kurmaksetra in Jagannatha Puri, the Lord pleased a brahmana devotee by
warmly embracing him. The LordÂ’s embrace cured the brahmanaÂ’s leprosy and
awarded him a beautiful body. By quoting the Kurma Purana, the Lord dispelled
the fear and illusion of a South Indian brahmana, who was under the misled
impression that his worshipable Goddess Sita Devi had been touched by a demon.
The Lord showed that the transcendental is beyond all material contamination,
and He endowed the brahmana with pure devotion. He saved the ignorant brahmana
Kalakrsna, who had been lured by maya into the hands of the infamous
Bhattathari sect of Malavara. All glories, all glories to my golden Lord,
Gaurasundara the beautiful, the divine abode of pure love. 


 


28)
The Lord was pleased with the service of Venkata Bhatta at Rangaksetra
(situated on the banks of the Kaveri), where the Vaisnavas firmly believe that
worship of Laksmi-Narayana is the ultimate objective. The Lord, in a seemingly
playful mood, taught Venkata Bhatta that the rasa pastimes of Krsna are fully maintained,
supported, and protected by the gopis. Since Krsna is ultimately the
superexcellent goal of all desirable objects, even Laksmi Devi is attracted by
Him. I sing with joy the unending glories of my golden Lord, Gaurasundara the
beautiful, the divine abode of pure love.  


 


29)
The Lord gave one of His devotees the Brahma-samhita, a famous scripture full
of the conclusions about devotion to Lord Krsna. The Lord lovingly sang the
lyrical verses of Krsna-karnamrtam, which depict Vraja-lila. This book was
composed by the South Indian poet BilvamangalaThakura. King Prataparudra
worshipped the LordÂ’s lotus feet by bowing down and placing them on his head. I
sing with joy the unending glories of my golden Lord, Gaurasundara the
beautiful, the divine abode of pure love. 


 


30)
Surrounded by devotees absorbed in sankirtana in front of the chariot, the Lord
looked like the divine and wonderful Nataraja, the king of dancers. Astounding
pilgrims and the friends and relatives of King Prataparudra, the Lord filled
their hearts with wonder. By His potency, the natural purport of the pastimes
of Lord JagannathaÂ’s chariot ride to Gundica was manifested in the poem
composed by Srila Rupa Gosvami. All glories, all glories to my golden Lord,
Gaurasundara the beautiful, the divine abode of pure love. 


 


31)
Wonderstruck and overwhelmed by the LordÂ’s genius, effulgence, and loving
symptoms, King Prataparudra of Utkala (Orissa) gave up all previous religious
conceptions and traditions, along with his sense of royal glory, heroism, and
power. Then, with a single-minded craving for the Lord, the King threw himself
before the LordÂ’s lotus feet to be crowned with their dust. I sing with joy the
unending glories of my golden Lord, Gaurasundara the beautiful, the divine
abode of pure love. 


 


32)
When the Lord was in South India, famous scholars worshiped Him, and powerful
kings, their ministers, and family members honored and revered Him. He was
their crown jewel of devotion. Then, according to the custom of sannyasis, the
Lord turned homeward toward Bengal to see for the last time His mother,
motherland, and the Ganga. I sing with joy the unending glories of my golden
Lord, Gaurasundara the beautiful, the divine abode of pure love. 


 


33)
As the fame of the Lord spread far and wide and news came of His arrival, all
of Bengal, proud of their Lord, prepared to receive and glorify Him. Even the
handful of puffed-up atheists and skeptics were ashamed of their lowliness when
they saw how the multitudes honored and loved the Lord. Upon His arrival, He
revitalized and rejuvenated His mother and other devotees who were dying due to
separation from Him. I sing with joy the unending glories of my golden Lord,
Gaurasundara the beautiful, the divine abode of pure love. 


 


34)
When at last the Lord returned to His motherland, Bengal, after five long years
of sannyasa, millions of people rushed to see Him. Deeply moved, with eyes full
of eagerness, they beheld their Lord, who attracts the hearts of everyone. A
tumultuous and continuous uproar spread in all directions and pierced the
skies, as millions upon millions of voices repeatedly resounded the holy names
of Hari. I sing with joy the unending glories of my golden Lord, Gaurasundara
the beautiful, the divine abode of pure love. 


 


35)
The Lord pacified His devotees, who were heartbroken for not being able to see
their master for such a long time. And He delivered and pardoning many sinners
and miserable persons (such as Capala Gopala). The Lord then began to run
towards Vrndavana, the abode of Krsna, carrying thousands of millions of people
in His wake. On the way, at Ramakeli, He was attracted by Sri Rupa and his
elder brother, Sri Sanatana, to whom He expressed feelings of love. I sing with
joy the unending glories of my golden Lord, Gaurasundara the beautiful, the
divine abode of pure love. 


 


36)
Leaving Ramakeli, the Lord continued through Bengal towards Jagannatha Puri.
After leaving Puri Dhama, Lord Caitanya passed through the Jharakhanda forest
on His way to Vrndavana. There He inspired the jungle animals such as tigers,
deer, and elephants to join in the congregational chanting of Lord KrsnaÂ’s Holy
Names. Intoxicated by the sweet Names of the Lord, the animals joyfully danced
along with the Lord, who was madly absorbed in the deepest devotional
ecstasies. The Supreme Lord experienced profound realizations in solitary
worship as He walked down the deep and impenetrable jungle paths of Jhadakhanda
with Balabhadra Bhattacharya. I offer my obeisances to that beautiful Golden Lord,
Gauranga Sundara, the divine form of Krsna prema. 


 


37)
Lord Gaurasundara showed great honor towards the Deities along the Ganges-bank
in Kasi, and unto Bindu Madhava at the confluence of the Ganges and the Yamuna
in Prayaga. Following the current of the Yamuna, the Lord began to quickly run
along her banks in anxious pursuit of a glimpse of the sacred place known as
Mathura. As divine thoughts of VrndavanaÂ’s pastimes overwhelmed His memory and
caused intolerable feelings of separation, Lord Gaurasundara fell unconscious.
I offer my obeisances to that beautiful Golden Lord, Gauranga Sundara, the
divine form ofKrsna prema.


 


38)
Lord Caitanya stated that the mood of deep separation that Madhavendra Puri was
able to taste, as depicted in the following beautiful verse first spoken by
Srimati Radharani, is the zenith point and desirable object of pure adoration:


 


ayi
dina-dayardra natha he


mathura-natha
kadavalokyase


hrdayam
tvad-aloka-kataram


dayita
bhramyati kim karomy aham


 


Â“O
my Lord! O most gracious master! O master of Mathura! When will I see You
again? Because of my not seeing You, my agitated heart has become unsteady. O
most beloved one, what shall I do now?Â” After the Lord entered into Vraja, the
background stage where pastimes of pure love are enacted, He became overwhelmed
to His heartÂ’s full satisfaction. The Lord was charmed to see the beautiful
gardens and forest groves that served as His playground for spiritual pastimes
in a previous era. While visiting the twelve forests of Vrndavana, the Lord
exhibited various different dealings with the cowherd boys and maidens. I offer
my obeisances to that beautiful Golden Lord, Gauranga Sundara, the divine form
of Krsna prema.


 


39)
While strolling through the forest groves of Vrndavana, the Lord was joyfully
welcomed by swarms of humming bumblebees busily engaged in discussion about
pure love as they hovered over the blooming flowers. Millions of trees lining
the forest grove harmoniously offered their respects unto Lord Gaurasundara in
unison with a variety of birds that were expertly singing and dancing in sheer
delight. The LordÂ’s mind became overflowed by loving feelings due to
remembering how the cows, calves, and oxen of the holy abode of Vrndavana would
affectionately call for Him in previous pastimes, thereby elating His emotions
in pure love. I offer my obeisances to that beautiful Golden Lord, Gauranga
Sundara, the divine form of Krsna prema.


 


40)
Hopelessly overwhelmed by a surge of pure love, Lord Gaurasundara madly danced
and chanted the Holy Names of Krsna. A profuse current of flowing tears
streamed from His eyes, passing over the radiant luster of His giant golden
form, over His brilliant garments that resembled the sun, and over the ground
in all four directions. The LordÂ’s joyful pastimes were ecstatically enhanced
by such gestures as His loudly mispronouncing the Holy Name of Krsna in a
delirious state, or His roaring with laughter due to being ecstatically
absorbed in deep emotion. I offer my obeisances to that beautiful Golden Lord,
Gauranga Sundara, the divine form of Krsna prema.


 


41)
Surcharged with the confusing dictations of pure love of God, Lord
Gaurasundara, dancing in ecstasy, anxiously approached the sacred place of
Radha Kunda, which was unmanifested at that time. The Lord hastily took bath in
that flooded paddy field, sanctified the water, and revealed it to be Sri Radha
Kunda. In deep humility, the Lord began to carefully recite verses from the
Scriptures depicting Sri Radha Kunda as the divine embodiment of pure love.


 


yatha
radha priya visnos


tasyah
kundam priyam tatha


sarva
gopisu saivaika


visnor-atyanta
vallabha


 


Â“Just
as Sri Radha is very dear to Lord Krsna, similarly Her divine pond, Sri Radha
Kunda, is dear to the Lord. Of all the gopis, She is the dearmost consort to
Lord Krsna.Â” I offer my obeisances to that beautiful Golden Lord, Gauranga
Sundara, the divine form of Krsna prema.


 


42)
As the Lord was visiting various places in Vrndavana where Lord Krsna performed
His pastimes, He visited that famous tamarind tree that existed during the
Dvapara era. Sitting beneath the tamarind tree, the LordÂ’s memory of His
confidential water-sporting pastimes with the cowherd maidens was aroused when
He saw the dancing gestures of the YamunaÂ’s waves. The LordÂ’s entire being was
captured by tasting the sweetness of Sri Radha within the depths of His heart.
Identifying with that selfsame sweetness and emotion that possessed His entire
self, the LordÂ’s entire existence was stolen away. This place is indicated to
be the place of origin of Gauratattva, for it was here that Lord Syamasundara
became greatly absorbed in the divine mood of Srimati Radharani. Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu, who is Himself the origin of all, eternally resides in this place.
I offer my obeisances to that beautiful Golden Lord, Gauranga Sundara, the
divine form of Krsna prema.


 


43)
Lord Gauranga mentioned a witty conversation that was carried on between a
parrot and his mate. In their talk, Lord Krsna, the transcendental Cupid, is
described to be illusioned due to His deep feelings of separation from Sri
Radha.


 


radha-sange
yada bhati


tada
Â‘madana-mohanahÂ’


ayatha
visva-moho Â’pi


svayam
Â‘madana-mohitahÂ’


 


The
female parrot said, Â“When Lord Krsna is with Radharani, He is the enchanter of
Cupid; otherwise, when He is alone, He Himself is enchanted by amorous
feelings, even though He enchants the whole universe.Â” By this pastime, Lord
Gauranga charmed the devoteesÂ’ hearts by showing that Lord KrsnaÂ’s sweetness
and charm ultimately lies in the fact that He can be subdued by pure love. I
offer my obeisances to that beautiful Golden Lord, Gauranga Sundara, the divine
form of Krsna prema.


 


44)
It was in the sacred place of Prayaga, in the bathing area known as
Dasasvamedha Ghata, that Lord Gauranga taught Srila Rupa Gosvami that the
ultimate objective of oneÂ’s devotional practices is to relish the sweet mellows
found in Sri Vrndavana, and the Lord instructed him to widely distribute that
sweetness. Later in Kasi, the Lord elaborately described to Srila Sanatana
Gosvami many topics of pure dedication, such as knowledge of proper
acquaintance with the environment, the means of applying that


knowledge,
and the ultimate goal of obtaining pure love of Godhead. Also, at the special
request of a Maharastrian brahman and Tapana Misra and other devotees, the Lord
destroyed the ignorant conception of the mayavadi renunciates in Varanasi. Lord
Gaurangadeva personally met the impersonalists there in a public assembly, and
pointed out that their mode of self-adoration was ultimately based on
enviousness and narrow-mindedness. In this way the Lord established that
factual independence was exhibited by those worshipping the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. I offer my obeisances to that beautiful Golden Lord, Gauranga
Sundara, the divine form of Krsna prema.


 


45)
While en route to Jagannatha Puri from Vrndavana, the Lord met and instructed
Srila Rupa Gosvami in Prayaga. Following this, Lord Gauranga arrived in
Varanasi where He found Prakasananda Sarasvati to be the leader of millions of
impersonalist renunciates who were followers of Sri Sankaracarya. By His pure
and affectionate personality, Lord Gauranga rescued Prakasananda Saraswati from
the deep well of the transformation theory of Sankaracarya and intoxicated the
sannyasis and residents of Kasi by engaging them in the glorification of Lord
KrsnaÂ’s Holy Names. Sri Gaurangadeva was the transcendental expert who granted
their passage over the material ocean, like a vessel carrying the nectar of all
the scriptural conclusions handed down in the disciplic line from the sage
Narada to Srila Vyasadeva. I offer my obeisances to that beautiful Golden Lord,
Gauranga Sundara, the divine form of Krsna prema.


 


46)
When Lord Caitanyadeva was in Kasi, He taught a grand assembly of the
impersonalist renunciates that the Srimad-Bhagavatam, as taught in the bonafide
disciplic succession from Lord Krsna to Narada and handed down by Srila
Vyasadeva, is the factual commentary on the conclusions of the Vedanta-sutras.
Sri Gauranga also explained the four fundamental verses of the
Srimad-Bhagavatam and revealed Lord Krsna as the ultimate reality beyond all
duality and the original principle of the entire universal arrangement. By the
Vedic aphorism Â“anavrttih sabdat anavrttih sabdat,Â” Lord Caitanya established
that conscious sound in its highest expression is Lord KrsnaÂ’s Holy Name, and
that it bestows the utmost benefit by releasing the soul from its conditioned
state of existence. I offer my obeisances to that beautiful Golden Lord,
Gauranga Sundara, the divine form of Krsna prema.


 


47)
By explaining the famous atmarama verse of the Srimad-Bhagavatam sixty-one
times, Lord Gauranga sliced to pieces the impersonalist doctrine propagated by
Sankaracarya. The Lord also recited many references from the Upanisads, such as
apani-pado javano grahita pasyaty acaksuh sa srnoty akarnah, whereby He
revealed the charming sweet nature of the Absolute TruthÂ’s spiritual pastimes.
Lord Caitanya fully censured the hateful conception of the impersonalists that
Lord KrsnaÂ’s transcendental form, name, qualities, pastimes, and Deity
manifestation are simply an imaginary transforrnation of the illusory energy
maya. I offer my obeisances to that beautiful Golden Lord, Gauranga Sundara,
the divine form of Krsna prema.


 


48)
When Lord Gauranga referred to the verse brahmeti paramatmeti bhagavan iti
sabdyate in the Srimad-Bhagavatam, He harmoniously accommodated the conception
of the non differentiated aspect of reality, brahman, the ultimate goal of the
impersonalists, with the conception of the localized aspect of reality,
paramatma, the goal of the mystic perfectionists. The Lord adjusted these two
truths by showing that they are included within and surpassed by the ultimate
conception of the nondualistic Absolute Truth, bhagavan, who is the primeval
principle of reality. When revealing this axiomatic truth in connection with
the joyful and confidential nature of the Supreme LordÂ’s spiritual pastimes,
Lord Gauranga pointed out the divine nature of Vraja, which is existing above
the Vaikuntha planets.

to the spiritual realm of Vaikuntha is Mathura, where Sri Krsna first appears.
Superior to Mathura is the Vrndavana forest where Krsna enjoyed the rasa dance.
Better still is Govardhana Hill, which was the site of even more confidential
pastimes of love. But best of all is Radha Kunda, which is situated at the foot
of Govardhana Hill, and holds the supreme position because it is overflooded
with the nectar of the highest kind of divine love. Who, acquainted with the
science of devotion, will not aspire for the divine service of Srimati
Radharani at Radha Kunda?Â” Initially, Lord Gauranga revealed the nature of pure
loving service rendered unto the son of Nanda Maharaja in the parental
relationship. But when considering the flow of dedicationÂ’s sweet mellows, Lord
Gauranga described the ultimate aspect of the Supreme LordÂ’s personality to be
Sri Gopijanavallabha, whose divine figure is the unlimited reservoir of all the
primary and secondary mellows tasted in pure devotion. Sri Gauranga also hinted
that the joyful and charming rasa-lila pastimes are an all-conscious reality,
none other than the personal potency of Srimati Radharani. Such transcendental
pastimes are found within the superexcellent and inconceivable spiritual world,
and are the highest conception of spiritual existence, auspiciousness, and
beauty. Lord Gauranga suggested this to be the supreme achievable object of the
living entities. I offer my obeisances to that beautiful Golden Lord, Gauranga
Sundara, the divine form of Krsna prema.


 


49)
In this manner Lord Gaurangadeva taught that all scriptural conclusions, as
perfectly passed down by the various spiritual preceptors through the medium of
sound, culminate in the embodiment of Sri Radhavinoda, the all-encompassing basis
of proper acquaintance with the environment. The means by which one may reach
Lord Krsna is by chanting His Holy Names in the association of pure devotees,
while the ultimate goal in pure love is service to Lord Krsna, who is so dear
to the cowherd maidens of Vrindavana. Lord Gaurangadeva taught these essential
scriptural conclusions in the assembly of scholarly persons. I offer my


obeisances
to that beautiful Golden Lord, Gauranga Sundara, the divine form of Krsna
prema.


 


50)
Lord Gaurasundara explained this famous verse of the Srimad-Bhagavatam
sixty-one times to Srila Sanatana Gosvami, and later to Prakasananda Saraswati:



 


atmaramas
ca munayo


nirgrantha
apy urukrame


kurvanty
ahaitukim bhaktim


ittham-bhuta
guno harih


 


Â“Even
the liberated souls fully satisfied in the self are irresistibly attracted by
the superexcellent qualities of Krsna and surrender to


Him
with unalloyed devotion.Â” The Lord separately combined each of the eleven words
found in that verse and established that each one is an enormous storehouse of
unlimited wealth supporting the conclusion of pure devotion. I offer my
obeisances to that beautiful Golden Lord, Gauranga Sundara, the divine form of
Krsna prema.


 


51)
Lord Gaurasundara revealed His disciplic line by inspiring Srila Sanatana
Gosvami, his younger brother Srila Rupa Gosvami, and Srila Jiva Gosvami. The
Lord requested them to excavate the lost places of pilgrimage and compose pure
devotional literature which describes the application of spiritual practices
and spontaneous devotion. Lord Gauranga also lovingly revealed His worshipable
personality to the servitors of Sri Jagannatha Deva at Nilachala (Sri
Puri-dhama). I offer my obeisances to that beautiful Golden Lord, Gauranga
Sundara, the divine form of Krsna prema.


 


52)
Lord Gaurasundara strongly condemned those who externally accepted the dress of
a renunciant yet, like monkeys, actually harbored desires for sense pleasures.
On the other hand, He honored that great devotee Ramananda RayaÂ’s devotional
effort to intimately teach some young girls a form of dance drama for the
pleasure of Lord Jagannatha. Considering RamanandaÂ’s service to be on the
platform of spontaneous devotion, the Lord proclaimed that such a level of
service was a great fortune attainable only after millions of births. I offer
my obeisances to that beautiful Golden


Lord,
Gauranga Sundara, the divine form of Krsna prema.


 


53)
The famous spiritual preceptor of the Visnusvami disciplic succession
suddhadvaita, Sri Vallabha Bhatta, lived in the village of Adhaila in sacred
Prayaga, and personally served Lord Gaurangadeva with resolute devotion in his
residence. Later in Jagannatha Puri, Lord Gauranga allowed Vallabha Bhatta to
enter into and relish the sweet taste experienced in parental attachment to
baby Krsna. The Lord also arranged for him to learn the appropriate mantras for
his worship from Sri Gadadhara Pandita. I offer my obeisances to that beautiful
Golden Lord, Gauranga Sundara, the divine form of Krsna prema.


 


54)
Diving deep into the reality of His own beauty and sweetness, Lord Govinda
stole the mood of Radharani and, garbing Himself in Her brilliant luster,
appeared as Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu. For the last twelve years of His manifest
pastimes He was deeply absorbed in union and separation, and He shared His
heartÂ’s inner feelings with His most confidential devotees such as Swarupa
Damodara and Ramananda Raya: bahire visajvala haya, antare anandamaya. Â“The
wonderful characteristic of divine love of Krsna is that although externally it
works like fiery lava, internally it is like sweet nectar that fills the heart
with the greatest joy.Â” Volcanic eruptions of ecstasy flowed from the heart of
Sri Gauranga in the agony of separation from Krsna. This Golden Lord, who
appeared like an intoxicated elephant, is none other than Lord Govinda. I offer
my obeisances to that beautiful Golden Lord, Gauranga Sundara, the divine form
of Krsna prema.


 


55)
Sri Gaurangadeva, embracing the neck of Sri Swarupa Damodara, began to
sorrowfully recite the prayers Srimati Radharani had previously spoken in the
agony of separation when Lord Krsna left Vrindavana for Mathura. The Lord would
continuously taste the mood of Srimati Radharani, who was experiencing untold
agony from the burning fire of Her tragic separation from Lord Krsna. With a
heavy heart, the Lord would describe what He was directly realizing in divine
trance. Those realizations are just like dreams to ordinary men. I offer my
obeisances to that beautiful Golden Lord, Gauranga Sundara, the divine form of
Krsna prema. 


 


56)
The eightfold symptoms depicting the moods of pure dedication would decorate
and radiantly enhance the beauty of the LordÂ’s bodily parts. Sometimes He
appeared like a tortoise who had withdrawn his limbs into his shell, and at
other times His body appeared elongated due to His joints becoming dislocated.
Sometimes Lord GaurasundaraÂ’s figure was as tender and aromatic as a lotus
flower. At other times the LordÂ’s body would appear red, yellow, or brilliant
with the white hue of the jasmine flower. I offer my obeisances to that
beautiful Golden Lord, Gauranga Sundara, the divine form of Krsna prema.


 


57)
Grief-stricken and overwhelmed with tragic feelings of separation, Lord
Caitanya quickly ran to the lion-gate of Lord JagannathaÂ’s grand temple. Moments
later, the Lord fell to the ground. In deep separation He manifested the form
of the tortoise incarnation Kurmadeva, and an extraordinarily sweet fragrance
began to emanate from the LordÂ’s unconscious figure. This attracted the telangi
cows who resided at Lord JagannathaÂ’s Temple, and they surrounded the Lord. I
offer my obeisances to that beautiful Golden Lord, Gauranga Sundara, the divine
form of Krsna prema.


 


58)
Once on a moonlit night, Lord Gaurangadeva, relishing the sweet mellows of Lord
KrsnaÂ’s pastimes, was wandering along the oceanÂ’s shore with His associates.
Suddenly the Lord saw the reflection of the moon dancing upon the rolling
waves. Unexpectedly, the Lord became overwhelmed by recollections of Lord
KrsnaÂ’s pastimes in the Yamuna River and fell unconscious. Next, Lord
GaurangaÂ’s body, unseen by the devotees, became as light as a piece of dried
wood and was gracefully carried away by the wind-god while lying upon the crest
of the oceanÂ’s rolling waves in a divine trance. Realizing Lord KrsnaÂ’s
water-sport pastimes in the Kalindi River with His dearmost cowherd-maiden
friends, the Lord dove deep into an ocean of divine ecstasy. I offer my
obeisances to that beautiful Golden Lord, Gauranga Sundara, the divine form of
Krsna prema.


 


59)
After searching for the Lord throughout the night, the exhausted devotees
finally found Him at nightÂ’s end near Cakratirtha, His elongated form lying
upon the moist sand. The devoteesÂ’ eyes were filled with joy as they glanced
upon the delicate and serene figure of their Lord. I offer my obeisances to
that beautiful Golden Lord, Gauranga Sundara, the divine form of Krsna prema.


 


60)
As the anxious devotees began to loudly chant the Holy Names of Krsna, this
divine vibration entered the LordÂ’s ears and touched the depths of His heart.
Immediately the LordÂ’s dislocated joints reunited, and He displayed the
beautiful figure which their eyes were accustomed to relishing. In a
semiconscious state, the Lord began to describe with deep feelings of
separation what He had seen while absorbed in divine trance. I offer my
obeisances to that beautiful Golden Lord, Gauranga Sundara, the divine form of
Krsna prema.


 


61)
In the sacred waters of the Yamuna in Vrindavana, Sri Radha-Govinda, along with
Their dearmost cowherd-maiden friends, perform various charming water-sport
pastimes. These divine pastimes are sometimes revealed, sometimes hidden,
sometimes in opposition to each other, and sometimes harmonious. In this way
the LordÂ’s pastimes are couched in different gestures which bring about
different types of divine hankering. The melodious tune of this confidential
spiritual treasure which astounds the entire universe was distributed by Sri
Caitanya Mahaprabhu. I offer my obeisances to that beautiful Golden Lord, Gauranga
Sundara, the divine form of Krsna prema.


 


62)
Upon glancing at the Cataka hill, intolerable feelings of separation
overwhelmed the Lord, and different pastimes in the mood of profound adoration
were incited, whereby the Lord began to rub His beautiful face on the ground.
When Sri Gauranga would remember the water-sport pastimes of Lord Krsna, He
would jump into the ocean and exhibit the divine symptoms of one intoxicated by
pure love. By performing these pastimes, the Lord would inundate the devoteesÂ’
hearts with waves from the grand ocean of love of Krsna. Those desperate waves
carried both transcendental anxiety and joy up onto the shore of the devoteesÂ’
hearts. Such inconceivable auspiciousness was bestowed only upon the LordÂ’s
most surrendered associates. I offer my obeisances to that beautiful Golden
Lord, Gauranga Sundara, the divine form of Krsna prema.


 


63)
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu is not only beyond the mundane experiences of sight and
sound, but He also arrests all intellectual endeavors to know Him. Being
situated in pure love of Godhead, He remains a mystery and astonishes even
those living entities who are fixed in self-realization. The revealed Vedas of
Lord Brahma and the Tantric literatures of Lord Shiva are simply searching
after Sri Gaurasundara, reality the beautiful. I offer my obeisances to that
beautiful Golden Lord, Gauranga Sundara, the divine form of Krsna prema.


 


64)
By freely distributing the Holy Name of Krsna, Sri Gaurangadeva purified the
scholarly intellectual class, the laborer class, the illiterate, and even the
lowest sections of society. The Lord alone was the embodiment of the greatest
wealth for all sincere and gentle souls, both the rich and the poor, the
aristocratic and the lowborn. Therefore, Lord Caitanya is respected and honored
by men and women alike as the savior of all, in both the mundane and spiritual
worlds. I offer my obeisances to that beautiful Golden Lord, Gauranga Sundara,
the divine form of Krsna prema.


 


65)
Like a golden moon, Sri Gauracandra appeared in the year 1407 Sakabda (1486
A.D.), at the onset of a lunar eclipse on a full-moon evening in the month of
March. When the Absolute Truth Sri Gaurangadeva incarnated in the beautiful
courtyard of Sacidevi, the residents of Mayapura were bathing in the sacred
Ganges, congregationally chanting the Holy Names of Hari, and making offerings
of various types of jewels to the Lord. I offer my obeisances to that beautiful
Golden Lord, Gauranga Sundara, the divine form of Krsna prema.


 


66)
This is the all-conquering conclusion: the highest conception of the Ultimate
Reality must also be the highest form of ananda, ecstasy. Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu is Krsna, ecstasy Himself, tasting His own sweetness and dancing in
ecstatic joy. His own Holy Name is the cause of His ecstasy, expressed as
dancing, and the Holy Name is the effect of His ecstasy, expressed as chanting.
The cause is the effect. The dynamo is creating ecstatic energy which makes Him
dance, and His chanting distributes that ecstasy to others. I offer my obeisances
to that beautiful Golden Lord, Gauranga Sundara, the divine form of Krsna
prema.


 


67)
Sri Isvara Puri became very fortunate when Lord Gauranga exhibited His
causeless mercy by accepting initiation from him. Sri Kesava Bharati was
similarly favored in that in his presence, Lord Gauranga shaved His beautiful
curly hair and accepted from him the garments of a renunciate. And Lord
Caitanya gave undivided attention to Sri Madhavendra Puri, stating that his
attachment for serving Lord KrsnaÂ’s Kisora form in conjugal love was the
highest expression of dedication. I offer my obeisances to that beautiful
Golden Lord, Gauranga Sundara, the divine form of Krsna prema.


 


68)
I offer my respects unto Sri Gaurangadeva, who rose like a golden moon in Sri
Mayapura in 1407 Sakabda, revealed the pastime of accepting the garments of the
renounced order, sannyasa, in 1431 Sakabda in order to bless the entire
material universe, and disappeared beyond the ordinary vision of the people of
this world in 1455 Sakabda. I offer my obeisances to that beautiful Golden
Lord, Gauranga Sundara, the divine form of Krsna prema.


 


69)
With great joy Sri Gaurasundara told His dearmost associates Sri Swarupa
Damodara and Ramananda Raya that the process of congregationally chanting the Holy
Names of Krsna bestows the highest benediction upon the living entities in this
age of Kali:


 


harse
prabhu kahena, Â“suna svarupa-rama-raya


nama
sankirrtana kalau, parama upayaÂ”


 


In
His famous composition Sri-Siksastakam also, Lord Gauranga has placed the
chanting of Lord KrsnaÂ’s Names on the topmost level of importance. The Supreme
Lord further taught that chanting Lord KrsnaÂ’s Names in pure love of Godhead
perfectly nourishes and fully satisfies all the living entities in the
universe. I offer my obeisances to that beautiful Golden Lord, Gauranga
Sundara, the divine form of Krsna prema.


 


70)
O my Golden Lord! (Suvarna-varna hemanga) O ocean of prema! Kindly grant me the
wealth of Your divine love! Please give some slight attention to this fallen soul
and pardon his unlimited offenses. There are so many servants of Sri Rupa who
are so dear to You. My only aspiration is that You count me as one of those
servitors. O Gaurasundara, You are the sole protector and embodiment of good
fortune for me, Ramananda Dasa. I offer my obeisances to you, O Gauranga
Sundara, my most beautiful Golden Lord, the divine form of Krsna prema.


 


71)
Whoever faithfully recites this composition of seventy prayers known as the
Premadhama-deva-stotram will be granted the opportunity to serve that beautiful
Golden Lord, Gauranga Sundara, who is none other than Syamasundara Himself
covered by the heart and halo (bhava and kanti) of Srimati Radharani.


 


72)
These prayers have been composed in the fifth century after the appearance of
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu by a certain sannyasa disciple of Srila Sarasvati
Thakura named Sridhara.
