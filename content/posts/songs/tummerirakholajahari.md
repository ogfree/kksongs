LYRICS:


(1)


tum
meri rākho lāja hari 


tum
jānata saba antarayāmī karanī kachu na karī

avaguṇa
mose bisarata nāhi pala china gharī gharī


sab
prapaÃ±ca kī poṭa bāńdh kari apne sīs dharī

dārā
suta dhana moha liye hauń sudhi-budhi saba bisarī


sūra
patita ko bega udhāro ab merī nāva bharī


 


WORD
FOR WORD TRANSLATION: 
Tum Meri Rakho
Laja Hari


 


TRANSLATION


1)
Please protect my honor, O Hari. You know everything, O Omniscient One. The
doer does not do anything.


 


2) I
am unable to be redeemed of my faults as each moment passes. I carry a bundle
bound of this worldly existence upon my head.


 


3) My
friends, sons, wealth, attachments, and everything I own have left me. The
fallen and destitute, Sura Dasa, begs to be delivered. Now my boat is filled
(i.e. my life will thus be completed).


 


REMARKS/EXTRA
