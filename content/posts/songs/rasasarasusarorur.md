TRANSLATION


1)
The Lord, who is a shower of nectar, whose thighs are broad, who kills the
demons, and who with a sword cuts the cycle of repeated birth and death,
holding a lotus flower, and filled with transcendental amorous desire, entered
the 
rasa
 dance.


 


2)
The Lord, who is splendidly anointed with sandal paste, whose chest is broad,
and who is the most handsome person in the world of moving and nonmoving
creatures, became the thief that gracefully stole the 
gopis
'
garments.


 


3)
On the hill earnest 
Radha
' worshiped the Supreme
Lord, who lifted 
Govardhana
 Hill, checked the great
rains, and stopped the anguish of the devotees. 


 


4)
Did not Lord Brahma, tears streaming down his face, recite many prayers, trying
to pacify Lord Krsna, the killer of 
Sakatasura
?


 


5)
To attain spiritual bliss let me always glorify the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, who, flooded with the splendor of many necklaces, maintaining the
devotees, His arms snakes and His form full of nectar, enjoys transcendental
pastimes in a solitary place near the charming waves of the 
Yamuna
,
in a forest decorated with many paths and filled with bumblebees maddened by
the sweet fragrance, and pleasant with cooling breezes, 


 


6)
Lord 
Gopala
, whose chest was decorated with a fresh
lotus garland attracting many bees, who was decorated with a peacock feather, a
necklace, and splendid 
tilaka
 pictures drawn in
mineral colors, whose broad smiles and auspicious words delight the devotees,
who is peaceful and eternally young, and who expanded into many forms during
the dancing, exclaimed "
Jaya
!" when He saw
the 
rasa
 dance arena. 


 


7)
O Lord who speaks sweetly, O Lord seen by the saintly devotees, O supreme
artist, O protector, O Lord who wonderfully carries a lunch and many other
things, O Lord followed by Siva, O Lord prayed to by Brahma, O cowherd boy,
please appear before me.


 


8)
The Supreme Lord, who lifted 
Govardhana
 Hill, who
killed His arrogant enemies, and who is sweetly worshiped by Sri 
Radha
, shines with great splendor.


 


9)
The 
gopi-rasa
 deity, wearing the mark of 
Srivatsa
, perspiring, and jubilant, was very happy to
display His strength in the wrestling arena.


 


10)
A shower of auspiciousness, handsome, and splendid as sapphire, the Lord
quickly and gloriously entered the flowing streams of the nectar of 
rasa
.


 


11)
Filled with amorous desire and the wildness of youth, and His smile making 
Kamadeva
 insignificant, the best of heroes shone with great
splendor as He ardently enjoyed the 
rasa
 dance. 


 


12)
With all your heart please accept Lord 
Vasudeva
, who
gracefully claps His hands, who is joyful and honest, whose face is a splendid
moon, whose forehead is charming, who is the destroyer of sins, who is a
cowherd boy, whose sweet muse charms the senses, who is dark as a host of
monsoon clouds, whose neck is graceful, who trembles with transcendental bliss,
who wears yellow garments, whose virtues cool the burning sufferings of
material existence, and who stays in the company of the young 
gopis
.


 


REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:


The entire song is a beautiful way how the entire spectrum
of art glorifies the Lord. Besides the singing of this song (music), elements
of verses all have special features to them. Hence, this song is called Â“Citra 
Kavitva
.Â” (Picture Verses)


 


Verses
1-4 are composed of a limited number of consonants. The remaining texts assume
the forms of pictures.


 


Verse
5 is conceived in the form of a wheel. In the following picture lines 1, 2, and
3 are the spokes and line 4 the rim. 


 


Verse
6 is conceived in the form of a serpent.


 


Verse
7 is conceived in the form of a lotus.


 


Verse
8 reads the same backwards and forwards. In Sanskrit each syllable is

' is 
ta-yi
 backwards. To understand Sanskrit lettering systems,
