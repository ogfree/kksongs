TRANSLATION



1) All
glories to Radha and Krsna and the divine forest of Vrndavana. All glories to
the three presiding Deities of Vrndavana--Sri Govinda, Gopinatha, and
Madana-mohana. 


 


2) All
glories to Syama-kunda, Radha-kunda, Govardhana Hill, and the Yamuna River
(Kalindi). All glories to the great forest known as Mahavana, where Krsna and
Balarama displayed all of Their childhood pastimes. 


 


3) All
glories to Kesi-ghata, where Krsna killed the Kesi demon. All glories to the
Vamsi-vata tree, where Krsna attracted all the gopis to come by playing His
flute. Glories to all of the twelve forests of Vraja. At these places the son
of Nanda, Sri Krsna, performed all of His pastimes. 


 


4) All
glories to Krsna's divine father and mother Nanda and Yasoda. All glories to
the cowherd boys, headed by Sridama, the older brother of Srimati Radharani and
Ananga Manjari. All glories to the cows and calves of Vraja. 


 


5) All
glories to Radha's divine father and mother, Vrsabhanu and the beautiful
Kirtida. All glories to Paurnamasi, the mother of Sandipani Muni, grandmother
of Madhumangala and Nandimukhi, and beloved disciple of Devarsi Narada. All
glories lo the young cowherd maidens of Vraja. 


 


6) All
glories, all glories to Gopisvara Siva, who resides in Vrndavana in order to
protect the holy dhama. All glories, all glories to Krsna's funny Brahmana
friend, Madhumangala. 


 


7) All
glories to Rama-ghata, where Lord Balarama performed His rasa dance. All
glories to Lord Balarama, the son of Rohini. All glories, all glories to all of
the residents of Vrndavana. 


 


8) All
glories to the wives of the proud Vedic brahmanas. All glories to the wives of
the Kaliya serpent. Through pure devotion they all obtained the lotus feet of
Lord Govinda. 


 


9) All
glories to the place where the rasa dance of Sri Krsna was performed. All
glories to Radha and Syama. All glories, all glories to the divine rasa dance, which
is the most beautiful of all Lord Krsna's pastimes. 


 


10)
All glories, all glories to the mellow of conjugal love, which is the most
excellent of all rasas and is propagated in Vraja by Sri Krsna in the form of
the divine parakiya-bhava [paramour love]. 


 


11)
Remembering the lotus feet of Lord Nityananda's consort, Sri Jahnava Devi, this
very fallen and lowly servant of Krsna sings the sankirtana of the holy name.
