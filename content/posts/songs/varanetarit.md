TRANSLATION


1) This maidservant has a complexion
just like lightning, and she is wearing a sari which has star like decorations
all over it. My name is Kamala 
Manjari
. Eternally
appearing to be only twelve-and-a-half years of age, I always live within the
abode of 
Svananda-sukhada-kunja
.


 


2) I render the service of
preparing the camphor within the assembly of 
Lalita
 
Sakhi
, of whom Sri 
Radha
 is the
leader and the center of all their activities. And the Lord of my mistress 
Radha
 is the delightful Son of 
Nanda

Maharaja, Who is also the treasure of my life.


 


3) I always desire to
execute conjugal service similar to that which is rendered by Sri 
Rupa
 
Manjari
 and her associates.
Thus I will certainly get utmost conviction and faith.


 


4) When will this
maidservant thus attain such complete spiritual perfection, living by the banks
of Sri 
Radha
- 
kunda
? I will
eternally serve 
Radha
 and 
Krsna
,
and all of my previous memories will be automatically forgotten.
