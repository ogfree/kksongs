TRANSLATION


1)
I have found, yes, I have found the wealth of the gem of chanting the Holy
Name.



2) My true spiritual master gave me a priceless thing. With his grace, I
accepted it.


 


3)
I found the treasure of my several births; I have lost the whole rest of the
world.


 


4)
No one can spend it, no one can steal it. Day by day it increases one and a
quarter times.


 


5)
On the boat of truth, the boatman was my true guru. I came across the ocean of
existence.


 


6)
The Lord of Mira 
Bai
 is the Courtly Lord 
Giridhara
, of whom I merrily, merrily sing His glories.
