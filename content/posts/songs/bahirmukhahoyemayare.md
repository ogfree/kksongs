TRANSLATION


1) Becoming inimical
towards the Lord, and adoring illusion, I have become madly attached to this
material existence. However, Krsna is so kind for He has arisen like the sun
within this material world just for my sake.


 


2) Oh 
sakhi
!
My dear, the moon-like Krsna is certainly an unlimited ocean of auspicious
qualities! He distributes His causeless mercy to all the offenders, not
hesitating to purify them and relieve them of their afflictions.


 


3) I have come into this
false material existence, adoring the material energy as if it is fit form my
enjoyment, and I am seized with the false conception that I am a male (a 
purusa
). But Lord Krsna, showing His compassion, descends
Himself and forcibly steals away all such false conceptions with the
transcendental sound of His flute.


 


4) My dear girlfriend, just
worship such a jewel-like Krsna with special care and attention. Now 
Bhaktivinoda
 admits that he is helplessly bound up to the
wonderful qualities of Sri 
Krsna's
 lotus feet. Thus,
I always bow my head in great awe and reverence before those divine feet.
