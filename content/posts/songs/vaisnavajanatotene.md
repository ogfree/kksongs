TRANSLATION


1) A
true Vaisnava understands pain of all, compassionate to all, brings happiness
to all, and does not feel pride about it.


 


2) The
Vaisnava does not criticize anyone, while humbly worshipping hundreds in the
world. The mother is indeed great who keeps the VaisnavaÂ’s tongue and mind
under control.


 


3) The
Vaisnava has equal vision to all and is not overly ambitious, looks at otherÂ’s
women as the mother, where no falsehood escapes the tongue, and hands do not
touch another personÂ’s gold.


 


4) The
Vaisnava is not affected by the attraction of illusion and attachment. While
having the mentality of an ascetic, the Vaisnava is attracted to the chanting
of the name of Lord Krsna (Reservoir of Pleasure), the VaisnavaÂ’s body itself
is a where all pilgrimages are found. 


 


5) The
Vaisnava conquered all lust and anger, and is devoid of cheating propensity and
trickery. The poet Narsi Mehta, by seeing the Vaisnava, seventy-one generations
of his family became redeemed.
