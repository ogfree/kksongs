TRASNLATION



1)
O Kesava! O Lord of the universe! O Lord Hari, who have assumed the form of a
fish! All glories to You! You easily acted as a boat in the form of a giant
fish just to give protection to the Vedas, which had become immersed in the
turbulent sea of devastation. 


 


2)
O Kesava! O Lord of the universe! O Lord Hari, who have assumed the form of a
tortoise! All glories to You! In this incarnation as a divine tortoise the
great Mandara Mountain rests upon Your gigantic back as a pivot for churning
the ocean of milk. From holding up the huge mountain a large scar like
depression is put in Your back, which has become most glorious. 


 


3)
O Kesava! O Lord of the universe! O Lord Hari, who have assumed the form of a boar!
All glories to You! The earth, which had become I,merged in the Garbhodaka
Ocean at the bottom of the universe, sits fixed upon the tip of Your tusk like
a spot upon the moon. 


 


4)
O Kesava! O Lord of the universe! O Lord Hari, who have assumed the form of
half-man, half-lionl All glories to You! lust as one can easily crush a wasp
between one's fingernails, so in the same way the body of the wasp like demon
Hiranyakasipu has been ripped apart by the wonderful pointed nails on Your
beautiful lotus hands. 


 


5)
O Kesava! O Lord of the universe! O Lord Hari, who have assumed the form of a
dwarf-brahmana! All glories to You! O wonderful dwarf, by Your massive steps
You deceive King Bali, and by the Ganges water that has emanated from the nails
of your lotus feet, You deliver all living beings within this world. 


 


6)
O Kesava! O Lord of the universe! O Lord Hari, who have assumed the form of
Bhrgupati [Parasurama]! All glories to You! At Kuruksetra You bathe the earth
in the rivers of blood from the bodies of I he demoniac ksatriyas that You have
slain. The sins of the world are washed away by You, and because of You people
are relieved room the blazing fire of material existence. 


 


7)
O Kesava! O Lord of the universe! O Lord Hari, who haze assumed the form of
Ramacandra! All glories to You! In the battle of Lanka You destroy the
ten-headed demon Ravana and distribute his heads as a delightful offering to
the presiding deities of the ten directions, headed by Indira. This action was
long desired by all of them, who were much harassed by this monster. 


 


8)
O Kesava! O Lord of the universe! O Lord Hari, who have assumed the form of
Balarama, the yielder of the prowl All glories to You! On Your brilliant white
body You wear garments the color of a fresh blue rain cloud. These garments are
colored like the beautiful dark hue of the River Yamuna, who feels great fear
due to the striking of Your plowshare. 


 


9)
O Kesava! O Lord of the universe! O Lord Hari, who have assumed the form of
Buddha! All glories to You! O Buddha of compassionate heart, you decry the
slaughtering of poor animals performed according to the rules of Vedic
sacrifice 


 


10)
O Kesava! O Lord of the universe! O Lord Hari, who have assumed the form of
Kalki! All glories to You! You appear like a comet and carry a terrifying sword
for bringing about the annihilation of the wicked barbarian men at the end of
the Kali-yuga. 


 


11)
O Kesava! O Lord of the universe! O Lord Hari, who have assumed these ten
different forms of incarnation! All glories to You! O readers, please hear this
hymn of the poet Jayadeva, which is most excellent, an awarder of happiness, a
bestower of auspiciousness, and it is the best thing in this dark world. 


 


12)
O Lord Krsna, I offer my obeisances unto You, who appear in the forms of these
ten incarnations. In the form of Matsya You rescue the Vedas, and as Karma You
bear the Mandara Mountain on Your back. As Varaha You lift the earth with Your
tusk, and in the form of Narasimha You tear open the chest of the daitya
Hiranyakasipu. In the form of Vamana You trick the daitya king Bali by asking
him for only three steps of land, and then You take away the whole universe
from him by expanding Your steps. As Parasurama You slay all of the wicked
ksatriyas, and as Ramacandra You conquer the raksasa king Ravana. In the form
of Balarama You carry a plow with which You subdue the wicked and draw toward
You the River Yamuna. As Lord Buddha You show compassion toward all the living
beings suffering in this world and at the end of the Kali-yuga You appear as
Kalki to bewilder the mlecchas [degraded low-class men].
