TRANSLATION


1) O Lord Krsna, You were
pleased by the vow kept by the daughters of the cowherd men, and when they were
intent on playing in the water of the Yamuna, You stole away their garments. O
Lord, O Master of all those who give benedictions, please be kind unto us.


 


2) O Lord Krsna, You
climbed the kadamba tree and expertly spoke very amazing joking words to the
gopis. Very eager to hear the gopi's prayers. You demanded that they beg for
their garments. O Lord, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.


 


3) O Lord Krsna, clothed
only with the waters of the Yamuna, the gopis were ardently in love with You.
Afflicted by the cold waters, they emerged from the river, and You became
pleased with their pure love for You.


 


4) O Lord Krsna, smiling
and speaking joking words, You placed the gopi's garments on Your shoulders.
You instructed them to offer obeisances (to Varuna), and they did this, keeping
one hand (to cover themselves).


 


5) O Lord Krsna, when You
requested that they offer obeisances with both hands, the gopis complied. You returned
their garments and granted all their desires.


 


6) O Lord Krsna, O great
thief of the gopi's hearts and minds, O lover of the gopis, Who is enchanted by
their love, please grant to me the service of Your own gopi friends.
