TRANSLATION


(Refrain)
I saw Lord 
Gaurangacandra
. Now I am overcome. Lord 
Gaura
 is a splendid moon rising in 
Navadvipa
,
a moon that destroys the horrible darkness of Kali-
yuga's

sins.


 


1)
His complexion is fair. His form is splendid, enchanting, handsome, sweet, and
graceful. His garments defeat the peerless rising sun. His face is handsome and
graceful.


 


2)
His eyes are restless with ecstatic spiritual love. He frees everyone from the
bonds of repeated birth and death. His graceful form is overcome with newer and
newer ecstatic spiritual love. He stays amongst the devotees.


 


3)
He gently smiles. He speaks sweet words. His slow movements are graceful.
Giving them the seed of ecstatic spiritual love, He delivers the poor fallen
people. Only 
Govinda
 
dasa

He did not deliver. Only 
Govinda
 
dasa

was cheated.
