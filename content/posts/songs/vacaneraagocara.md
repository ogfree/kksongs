TRANSLATION


1) Vrndavana
is beyond the descriptive power of words.Â  It is the best of all holy places.Â 
It is self-manifest, filled with most intense transcendental bliss, free from
the touch of material miseries of old-age and death, and the place where Lord
Krsna eternally enjoys nectar pastimes.


 


2) Radha and
Krsna's love is more glorious than gold purified in ten thousand flames.Â  Radha
and Krsna make great waves in the ocean of nectar.Â  The love in Their eyes is
like a cakora bird.Â  Kama and Rati meditate on Them.Â  Their love and happiness
are the closest of friends.


 


3) Charming
Srimati Radharani, the best of the gopis, stays on Lord Krsna's left side, Her
complexion the colour of the filament of a golden flower, clothed in the
garment of ecstatic love for Krsna and a blue silk sari, and Her limbs are
beautiful with many ornaments.


 


4) Become
Their gopi-companion.Â  Make Them more dear than life.Â  With your eyes drink the
nectar of Their beauty and pastimes.Â  Dive in an ocean of bliss.Â  Always serve
the youthful Divine Couple, who are seated on a jewel throne and beyond the
rules of the Vedas.


 


5) Why don't
you worship Lord Hari now that you have this rare human birth?Â  If you don't
worship Him, what do you think will be your fate after death?Â  Give up all
other duties.Â  Don't worship the demigods.Â  Serve Lord Krsna's feet.


 


6) Do not
worship Lord Nandanandana, the blissful master of Vraja, and the entire world
around you will become filled with pain.Â  Become attracted to higher material
realms, the attainment of liberation, or the hellish pleasures of this sphere,
and your valuable human birth will become spoiled.


 


7) Do not put
your trust in the material body.Â  After death Yamaraja will punish you and your
karma will push you into an ocean of pain.Â  Now that you have heard and
understood this, please follow the path of the saints and scriptures.Â  Worship
and love the feet of the youthful Divine Couple.


 


8) The
fruitive worker of karma-kanda and the speculations of jnana-kanda are two pots
of poison.Â  If one drinks these two poisons, and then proclaims that they are
both as sweet as nectar, he will fall from the human realm and spend a long
time wandering in many species of life, eating many abominable things, and
enjoying many horrible pleasures.


 


9)
 
They
who proclaim someone else as their Lord and don't love Radha-Krsna don't
understand anything of loving devotional service.Â  Not asking about devotional
service and all their thoughts placed in the illusory material world, they have
wasted their lives.


 


10) Most
people know only of work and philosophy.Â  They don't know anything about
devotional service.Â  Each with a different opinion, they are all fools. Â Don't
listen to their talk.Â  Learn about devotional service, the life of the
devotees.


 


11) Lord Hari
is present in every corner of the material world.Â  Brahma and Siva are His
order-carriers.Â  Talk of His pastimes is very very sweet.Â  One who knows this
is a great soul.Â  I yearn for his association.


 


12) Thirst to
attain Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.Â  Worship Him.Â  Love Him as
the residents of Vraja did.Â  Reside in Vrajapura, where Lord Krsna eternally
enjoys pastimes.Â  Stay in the company of great souls that relish the nectar of
Krsna. Great souls stay always in Vraja, day and night their hearts full of
love for Krsna.Â  That is the truth.Â  It is not otherwise.Â  Srila Jiva Gosvami
has proved it.


 


13) I will
meditate on the lotus feet of the devotees, hear from them, remember Lord
Krsna's gopi-friends, and always be happy in Vrajapura.


 


14) I will
meditate on the youthful Divine Couple and sing of Their nectar pastimes.Â  I
pray for that.Â  In this life or after death I have no other desire.Â  Thus
speaks poor-hearted Narottama dasa.
