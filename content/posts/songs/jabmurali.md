TRANSLATION


1) When 
You

put Your lips on Your flute, You fill it with love and love, such that the
assembly of devotees feel like saying, Â“
Hari
! 
Hari
!Â”

Such is the way 
Kanhaiya
 plays the flute.


 


2) Whenever the son of 
Nanda
 Maharaja plays the flute in this great tune, birds
begin to sing along while peacocks dance. All cowherd boys and girls become mad
with love.


 


3) 
Radharani
,
the beloved daughter of 
Vrsabhanu
, became madly in
love with 
Kanhaiya
. The tune played by the 
YamunaÂ’s
 banks at the moment was, Â“such is the way 
Kanhaiya
 plays the flute.Â”
