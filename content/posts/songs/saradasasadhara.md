TRANSLATION


1)
All glories to the Lord, who is happy to see the autumn moon, who appears with
His transcendental pastimes, whose sweet flute-music arouses the ecstatic love
of the beautiful 
gopis
 . . .


 


2)
Â  
. . 
.who
 is very
handsome, searching for whom all the beautiful young 
gopis
,
overwhelmed with amorous passion, without a sound left their families in the
middle of the night, . . . 


 


3)
Â  
. . 
.who
, seeing the
desires of the doe-eyed 
gopis
, playfully joked with
them, who teased them, wounding them with the sharp dagger of His splendid
words, only to be Himself wounded by them, . . .


 


4)
Â  
. . 
.who
 embraced
and kissed the delighted 
gopis
, who, seeing that the
beautiful-eyed 
gopis
 had become proud at heart,
suddenly disappeared, . . .


 


5)
. . 
.whose
 pastimes the young 
gopis

imitated on the 
Yamuna's
 shore, whom they could not
see, about whom they inquired from the trees, the glories of whom they
repeatedly and eagerly sang, . . .


 


6)
Â  
. . . for whose company they plaintively
begged, whose transcendental form appeared before them, who enjoyed their
company, who was angrily asked "Why did You hide?" who answered,
"What I did was for the best," who seated Himself among them, . . .


 


7)
. . 
.who
 is naturally very merciful, who abandoned the

gopis
, whose pastimes are a bunch of blossoming
flowers, who is as dark as a blue lotus, who smiles gently, who enjoys pastimes
of love, who expanded His form many times, who performed the 
rasa
 dance, . . .


 


8)
. . 
.who
 had the 
gopis
 form
a great circle, who is the origin of all transcendental amorous pastimes, who
placed
Â  
His splendid arm on the shoulder
of each young 
gopi
, . . .


 


9-10)
. . .who, at the edge of the forest, which was filled with 
gopis
,
which was cooled by a pleasant breeze,
Â 

which was beyond the boundaries of the material world, and which was filled
with graceful music, the jingling of many ornaments, and black bees wandering
among many 
campaka
 flowers, gracefully placed His
flower-blossom lips to the flute, . . .


 


11)
Â  
. . .who stunned the moon, who from far away
aroused the amorous desires of the immortal wives of the demigods, who was
drawn into many transcendental pastimes for a long time, who was showered with
many 
kalpa-vrksa
 flower petals, . . .


 


12)
. . .who enjoyed transcendental pastimes in a night He made as long as a 
kalpa
, who filled with wonder the demigods and demons in
the sky, who was worshiped by all the beautiful 
gopis
,
each jubilantly aware that He was standing by her side, . . . 


 


13)
. . 
.whose
 waves of amorous glances agitated the
doe-eyed 
gopis
, who touched their full breasts, who
enjoyed amorous pastimes with them, who is very powerful, whose handsome cheeks
were decorated with perspiration, . . .


 


14)
Â  
. . 
.who
 enjoyed
water-pastimes in the 
kumuda
-filled 
Yamuna
, who splashed the transcendental bodies of the young

gopis
, whose flower garland became broken, whose
bodily hairs stood erect with 


joy
,
. . .


 


15)
Â  
. . 
.who
 wears a
garland of forest flowers, who likes to see the beautiful forests, who enjoys
pastimes at night, who wears a necklace of jewels, and who charms the hearts of
the young girls of 
Vraja
! All glories to Him! 


 


16)
O friend of the surrendered souls, O ocean of nectar, O Lord whose face is
splendid with drops of perspiration, all glories to 
You
!
You are served by all the demigods. Who are we, the fallen souls, in comparison
to them?


 


17)
O Lord whose cheeks are splendidly decorated with earrings, O Lord who defeated

Indra
, O Lord who lifted 
Govardhana

Hill, O Lord who made 
Gokula
 prosper, all glories to
You! All glories to 
You
! O 
Lord

who crushed the demon Mura, please give to me love for You.
