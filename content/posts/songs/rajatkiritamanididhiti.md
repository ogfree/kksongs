TRANSLATION


1)
Though His face is like a spotless moon, still it is further brightened by a shining
crown of jewels. His earrings resemble Jupiter and Venus rising in the evening
sky. I forever worship this Lord Sri Rama, guru of the three worlds.


 


2)
When He awakens and opens His lotus eyes, their luster resembles the early rays
of the rising sun. His teeth are enclosed by charming bimba fruit-red lips. His
nose is shapely and graceful and seeing the beams of His beautiful smile, the
white-rayed moon accepts defeat. I forever worship this Lord Sri Rama, guru of
the three worlds.


 


3)
The throat of the unborn Lord is like a three-ringed conch shell, and His form
is soft as the lotus. He wears a shining necklace of pearls set in gold, and
thus He resembles a water-laden cloud accompanied by lightning flashes and a
flock of cranes. Such is Sri Rama, guru of the three worlds, whom I perpetually
adore.


 


4)
In Her upraised hand Sita Devi holds a thousand-petalled lotus flower, and Her
five graceful fingers make it appear that the flower's hundred petals are
covered by another five petals. I forever worship Rama, best of the Raghu
dynasty, by whose side forever remains this Sita, whose radiance is like molten
gold.


 


5)
Before Rama stands his brother Laksmana, deeply attached to His elder brother's
service, the most skilled of archers, his body brilliant golden, and enhanced
by splendid ornaments. He is also known as Sesa, the all-accommodating abode of
the worlds. I worship this Lord Sri Rama guru of the three worlds.


 


6)
Like the nectar-rayed moon shining on the ocean of the Raghu dynasty, He slew
the foremost among the man-eating demons, Marica and Subahu, thus protecting
the sacrifice performed by the sage Visvamitra for the welfare of His
ancestors. I worship this Lord Sri Rama, guru of the three worlds.


 


7)
Slaying the raksasas Khara, Trisira, Kabandha, and their armies, He rendered
safe the forest of Danda-kanana. By killing the monkey-king, Sugriva's enemy, Bali, He made alliance with him, I adore Sri Rama, best of the Raghu dynasty, the slayer of
the ten-headed Ravana.


 


8)
After breaking Siva's bow, He married Sita, daughter of Janaka-raja. Then on
the path home, He defeated the mighty Parasurama, best of Bhrgu's line,
bringing pleasure to Maharaja Dasaratha, His father. I forever worship this
Lord Sri Rama, the foremost descendant of Kakutstha and guru of the three
worlds.
