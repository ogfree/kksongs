TRANSLATION


1)
Love for the lotus feet of the Divine Couple is the resting place of
transcendental bliss.Â  Radha and Krsna's holy names are the reservoir of
transcendental sweetness.Â  I happily fall down to offer my respectful
obeisances to Radha and Krsna's lotus feet.


 


2)
The Divine Couple's sweet, sweet holy name is life of the mind's memory.Â  Their
pastimes are the best remembering.Â  Remembering Them is both the goal and the
way to attain it.Â  That is the truth of all truths.Â  This book is not the only
place that it is said.


 


3)
Sri Krsna is splendid like a monsoon cloud, very sweet and charming, expert,
gracefully dressed in yellow garments, decorated with jewel ornament, and
crowned with a peacock feather placed in His hair.


 


4)
He is decorated with musk, sandal paste, kunkuma, and other fragrances.Â  His
three-fold bending form is sweet and charming.Â  His transcendental body is
decorated with garlands of flowers so fresh they draw swarms of maddened
bumblebees eager for honey.


 


5)
His gentle smile is sweet.Â  He is expert at tasting the nectar of
transcendental pastimes.Â  He is surrounded by the amorous girls of Vraja.Â  His
lotus feet are decorated with jewel anklets.Â  His toenails eclipse the glory of
the crescent moon.


 


6)
When they hear the warbling of the male swan that is Krsna's anklets, the
female swan gopis can no longer remain peacefully in their homes.Â  Love for Him
growing in their hearts, they run, leaving their household duties far behind,
to meet Him, their lover.


 


7)
The music of the straight flute placed to Krsna's lips enchants the world.Â 
Entering first the ear and then the heart, that music attracts all living
beings.


 


8)
Devotional service to Lord Govinda is eternal.Â  They who serve Him are His
servants eternally.Â  The land of Vrndavana is glorious.Â  There the Yamuna's
water glitters eternally.Â  Eight forests are on the Yamuna's shore.


 


9)
Vrndavana is splendid with cooling moonlight and glorious with kalpa-vrksa
trees and kalpa-lata vines blossoming in all six seasons.Â  Full of
transcendental bliss and glorious as the full moon, it makes everyone eager to
see its blissful form.


 


10)
Surrounded by the gopis and very handsome and charming.Â  Lord Govinda is full
of transcendental bliss.Â  The Divine Couple is beautiful, charming and overcome
with passionate love.


 


11)
O mind, take shelter of the lotus feet of the Vrajagopis.Â  Don't listen to the
useless din of the materialists' words.Â  Fill my heart with pure love for the
Divine Couple.


 


12)
O mind, just this one time accept Lord Krsna as your supreme master.Â  I tell
you the truth.Â  Sri Sri Radha and Krsna's lotus feet are supremely glorious,
Their pastimes are glorious, Their land of Vrajapura is glorious, and their
friends, the sakhi-gopis and manjari-gopis are glorious.


 


13)
This material body, which one attains because of his previous pious and impious
deeds is temporary and the foolish attempt by all conditioned souls to accumulate
more and more wealth is a clever trick of the illusory potency maya.Â  When the
material body dies, what will happen to all the carefully collected wealth?Â 
Where will it go?Â  O mind, don't work day and night with a great struggle
simply to collect money.Â  You are so foolish that you constantly work for such
a fleeting goal.


 


14)
A monarch's kingdom is just like the dramatic performance of an actor:Â 
although one sees them, they are never actually real, but only a pretence
arranged by the illusory energy maya.Â  O mind, don't pay attention to these
false material things.Â  Fix your mind always on the Supreme Personality of
Godhead.Â  Fear His displeasure.Â  Don't be concerned with other things.


 


15)
O mind, don't sin.Â  Stay far away from sinful persons.Â  Don't work to attain
material piety, the resting place of material happiness.Â  Don't strive for the
false liberation imagined by the impersonalists.


 


16)
Dive into the shoreless nectar ocean of pure love for Krsna, larger than the
largest salt-water ocean.Â  If one swims in that nectar ocean of live for Krsna,
Lord Krsna will make all his sufferings disappear, and he will attain endless
transcendental bliss.


 


17)
Take great care only to serve the Divine Couple, and don't let any other
activity touch you.Â  Know that the chanting of the holy names of Sri Sri Radha
and Krsna is the supreme spiritual meditation.Â  Please don't try to raise any
objections to this, or try to present evidence confirming any other view.


 


18)
O mind, please engage in pure devotional service, which cannot be followed by
the fruitive workers, speculative philosophers, or pseudo-devotees.Â  Just
accept that the opinion of the exalted devotees in Vraja is the perfect
explanation of the Absolute Truth.


 


19)
I shall continually offer prayers to the Divine Couple, and I shall describe
the pure love of the Lord and His devotees.Â  With my words I shall prove that
the Supreme Lord is not different from the chanting of His holy names.Â  O mind,
have firm faith in Lord Krsna, and worship the reddish soles of His lotus
feet.Â  Do this, and the karmic results of your past sins will be smashed.


 


20)
O mind, please place in my heart Sri Sri Radha Krsna's lotus feet, which are my
only treasure.Â  Again and again hear the holy names of the Divine Couple from
the mouths of the devotees, and in this way attain transcendental bliss.


 


21)
Srimati Radharani's transcendental form has the splendour of gold.Â  Weeping, I
pray to attain the glance of Her lotus eyes.Â  Sri Krsna's handsome form is
splendid as a monsoon cloud.Â  From it the entire material cosmos is manifested.


 


22)
I yearn to engage in devotional service with the gopis at my four sides.Â  That
service is my great happiness.Â  Again and again Narottama says: This is the
desire in my heart.
