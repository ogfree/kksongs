TRANSLATION


1) Overcome with feelings
of separation, He stays awake the whole night.


 


2) He meditates on You.
Without You, 
Krsna
 is very unhappy.


 


3) Bewildered, He embraces
His yellow cloth. He thinks the cloth is You.


 


4) He cannot taste any
sweetness. Fainting, He falls to the ground.


 


5) His heart is tossed to
and fro by 
Kamadeva's
 waves. His limbs are bent. 


 


6) He speaks broken words
in a choked voice. 
Govinda
 
dasa

does not understand what has happened to Him.
