TRANSLATION


1) In
truth, all things belong to You. No jiva is owner of anything. The tiny soul
wanders in this world mistakenly thinking, Â“I am this transitory body, and
everything related to this body is mine.Â” Thus he suffers sorrow and fear.


 


2) The
conditioned soul is falsely proud and considers everything attached to the
words Â“IÂ” and Â“mineÂ” to be his treasures alone.


 


3) Due
to that same vanity, I fell into this world. Floundering in the ocean of
mundane existence like a drowning man, I suffer the pangs of rising and sinking
in that ocean.


 


4) I
take shelter at Your lotus feet, which award fearlessness, and dedicate myself
to You on this day.


 


5) The
vanity of Â“IÂ” and Â“mineÂ” has left me now. May it never again find a place
within my heart.


 


6) O
Lord, please give me this strength, that I may be able to keep the false
conceptions of Â“IÂ” and Â“MineÂ” far away.


 


7) May
the mood of self-surrender to the Supreme Lord remain firmly fixed in my heart
and not prove to be like the momentary cleanliness of an elephant after a bath.


 


8)
Bhaktivinoda begs at the lotus feet of Lord Nityananda for the grace which
delivers one from all false pride.
