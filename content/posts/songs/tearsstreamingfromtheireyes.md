LYRICS:


(1)


Tears streaming from their
eyes


Nanda
 and 
Yasoda
 hug their son


Tightly they hold their
dearest prize.


Then as the reddish
brilliant thousand-rayed sun


 


(2)


Slowly begins to rise in
the morning sky 


Smiling graceful lotus-eyed

Krsna
 walks


In the forest 
The
 boys and 
surabhi
 cows follow
by


His side Playful jokes
adorn His talks


 


(3)


With His friends Flowers
adorn His limbs and crown.


Complex graceful melodies
fill His flute.


He happily leads many
millions of cows down


The flower-filled forest
path Yogurt and fruit


 


(4)


Are His
sweet and pleasant lunch
 in the
cooling shade 


Of a fragrant flowering
tree in a forest glade.
