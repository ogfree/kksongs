TRANSLATION


1) In slow and slow steps,
the small baby steps of 
Hari
 enter the sweet land of 
Kunja
.


 


2) My soul forgets and
everything and goes to 
Kunja
. My eyes are taken away
by the Lord 
Hari
 and goes.


 


3-4) 
With

strong light and effulgent rays coming on the land of 
Vrndavana
,
The Lotus Eyed 
Muralidhara
 
Krsna

comes and plays the flute!


 


5) Everywhere in 
Kunja
 is very 
very
 beautifully
green. 
Vrndavana
 gets even more beautifully green
when Lord 
Hari
 comes.


 


6) Â“
Nimki


Jhimki
Â” from the LordÂ’s anklets vibrates beautifully
as He dances.
