TRANSLATION


1) He is splendid like a
sapphire mirror. His limbs eclipse even 
Kamadeva
.


 


2) I do not know of any
eyes like His reddish eyes, eyes that shoot 
Kamadeva's

arrows.


 


3) O 
gopi
-friend,
whom did I meet? It was 
Nanda's
 son. Because of Him a
palace has now become a wild forest and a blazing fire has become cooling
sandal paste.


 


4) Because of Him the
southern wind now blows from the north. Because of Him I cannot bear the
glistening moonlight.


 


5) Please make a bed from
lotus leaves and petals. This pious girl will rest upon it.


 


6) My thoughts rest in Him.
My eyes yearn for Him. My shyness and my peaceful composure are now thrown far
away.


 


7) What fruit will come
from the great state of confusion in this girl's life? 
Govinda


dasa
 says: She will meet 
Krsna
.
