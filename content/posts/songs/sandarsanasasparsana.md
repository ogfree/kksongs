TRANSLATION


1)
There are unlimited numbers of ecstatic 
lilas

which 
Radha
 and 
Krsna
 play
daily all throughout 
Vrndavana
 with Their
girlfriends. They sometimes look at each other in different ways, touch and
caress each other, converse in many different types of talks, and sometimes
block each others' path. They sport the 
rasa
 dance,
or play different types of water sports in the 
Yamuna


river
, and sometimes 
Krsna

takes the role of a boatman while They engage in different types of pastimes in
a boat on the 
Yamuna
. There are different kinds of
joking thefts Â– sometimes 
Krsna
 steals 
Radharani's
 necklace, and almost every day He gets His
flute stolen by 
Radharani
 and Her friends. Sometime 
They
 play the 
ghatta
 
lila
, better known as the 
dana-keli

Â– His begging of charity from the 
yougurt
-pots
of the 
gopis
. And sometimes 
They

run around playing hide-and-seek throughout the forest bowers.


 


2)
Sometimes 
They
 get drunk on huge quantities of
honey-wine, sometimes 
Krsna
 comes in numerous types
of women's dress, and sometimes He pretends to be sleeping just to listen to the

sakhis
 talk about Him. They have gambling matches
with dice and place different kinds of bets, 
They

sometimes have a tug-of-war with each other's clothes, and sometimes there is
kissing, embracing, clawing with fingernails, drinking the nectar of berry-red
lips, and conjugal union. Thus some of 
Radha-Krsna's

innumerable daily pastimes are understood.


 


3)
All these different types of union constantly produce a gala festival of most
charmingly beautiful playful pastimes. All these 
lilas
 are uncommonly wonderful --- they are a
veritable reservoir filled with the most brilliant mellows of the conjugal 
rasa
.


 


4)
Only an extremely rare and highly fortunate soul takes a curios delightful
interest in such daily 
lilas

of Sri 
Sri
 
Radha-Krsna
. He
constantly lives in 
Vraja
 and takes on all the
ecstatic moods of transcendental affection (
rati
),
which keeps swelling and increasing all the way up to the topmost beatific peak
of 
mahabhava
. Thus saturated with 
Their

transcendental daily pastimes and absorbed in 
Vraja

consciousness, such a precious fortunate soul always inquires and searches
after the means to enter into those pastimes.
