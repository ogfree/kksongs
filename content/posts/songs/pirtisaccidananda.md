TRANSLATION

1) Love and affection for the nature of eternity, knowledge, and bliss is like
a very beautiful woman whose ornaments are all the good qualities headed by
mercifulness and religiosity.


 


2)
The divine wisdom of pure jnana is her silken sari, and the practice of the
yoga of devotional service is her excellent bodily fragrance. Adorned by these
qualities, that beautiful and chaste woman steals away the mind of Krsna
Himself.


 


3)
lf ornaments are worn by one completely devoid of beauty, then is such a person
considered to be beautiful in this world? Similarly, one possessing good
qualities like mercifulness and religiosity is unable to satisfy Lord Krsna if
devoid of love for Him.


 


4)
Just as there is no beauty to an ornament worn on the body of a female monkey,
in the same way I do not hold in very high esteem qualities such as
mercifulness and religiosity if they are devoid of love for Krsna.
