TRANSLATION


1) 
Arjuna

said, O 
Krsna
, what is the situation of one who does
not follow the principles of scripture but who worships according to his own
imagination? Is he in goodness, in passion or in ignorance? 


 


2) The Supreme Lord said, according
to the modes of nature acquired by the embodied soul, one's faith can be of
three kinds--goodness, passion or ignorance. Now hear about these. 


 


3) According to one's
existence under the various modes of nature, one evolves a particular kind of
faith. The living being is said to be of a particular faith according to the
modes he has acquired. 


 


4) Men in the mode of
goodness worship the demigods; those in the mode of passion worship the demons;
and those in the mode of ignorance worship ghosts and spirits. 


 


5-6) Those who undergo
severe austerities and penances not recommended in the scriptures, performing
them out of pride, egoism, lust and attachment, who are impelled by passion and
who torture their bodily organs as well as the 
Supersoul

dwelling within are to be known as demons. 


 


7) Even food of which all
partake is of three kinds, according to the three modes of material nature. The
same is true of sacrifices, austerities and charity. 
Listen,

and I shall tell you of the distinctions of these. 


 


8-10) Foods in the mode of
goodness increase the duration of 
life,
 purify one's
existence and give strength, health, happiness and satisfaction. Such
nourishing foods are sweet, juicy, fattening and palatable. Foods that are too
bitter, too sour, salty, pungent, 
dry
 and hot, are
liked by people in the modes of passion. Such foods cause pain, distress, and
disease. Food cooked more than three hours before being eaten, which is
tasteless, stale, putrid, decomposed and unclean, is food liked by people in
the mode of ignorance. 


 


11) Of sacrifices, that
sacrifice performed according to duty and to scriptural rules, and with no
expectation of reward, is of the nature of goodness. 


 


12) But that sacrifice
performed for some material end or benefit or preformed ostentatiously, out of
pride, is of the nature of passion, O chief of the 
Bharatas
.



 


13) And that sacrifice
performed in defiance of scriptural injunctions, in which no spiritual food is
distributed, no hymns are chanted and no remunerations are made to the priests,
and which is faithless--that sacrifice is of the nature of ignorance. 


 


14) The austerity of the
body consists in this: worship of the Supreme Lord, the 
brahmanas
,
the spiritual master, and superiors like the father and mother. Cleanliness, simplicity,
celibacy and nonviolence are also austerities of the body. 


 


15) Austerity of speech
consists in speaking truthfully and beneficially and in avoiding speech that
offends. One should also recite the Vedas regularly. 


 


16) And serenity, simplicity,
gravity, self-control and purity of thought are the austerities of the mind. 


 


17) This threefold
austerity, practiced by men whose aim is not to benefit 
themselves

materially but to please the Supreme, is of the nature of goodness. 


 


18) Those ostentatious
penances and austerities which are performed in order to gain respect, honor
and reverence are said to be in the mode of passion. They are neither stable
nor permanent. 


 


19) And those penances and
austerities which are performed foolishly by means of obstinate self-torture, or
to destroy or injure others, are said to be in the mode of ignorance. 


 


20) That
gift which is given out of duty, at the proper time and place, to a worthy
person, and without expectation of return,
 is considered to be charity in the mode of goodness. 


 


21) But charity performed
with the expectation of some return, or with a desire for 
fruitive

results, or in a grudging mood, is said to be charity in the mode of passion. 


 


22) And charity performed
at an improper place and time and given to unworthy persons without respect and
with contempt is charity in the mode of ignorance. 


 


23) From the beginning of
creation, the three syllables--
om

tat sat--have been used to indicate the Supreme Absolute Truth [Brahman]. They
were uttered by 
brahmanas
 while chanting Vedic hymns
and during sacrifices, for the satisfaction of the Supreme. 


 


24) Thus the
transcendentalists undertake sacrifices, charities, and penances, beginning
always with 
om
, to attain
the Supreme. 


 


25) One should perform
sacrifice, penance and charity with the word tat. The purpose of such
transcendental activities is to get free from the material entanglement. 


 


26-27) The Absolute Truth
is the objective of devotional sacrifice, and it is indicated by the word sat. These
works of sacrifice, of penance and of charity, true to the absolute nature, are
performed to please the Supreme Person, O son of 
Prtha
.



 


28) But sacrifices, austerities
and charities performed without faith in the Supreme are nonpermanent, O son of

Prtha
, regardless of whatever rites are performed. They
are called 
asat
 and are useless
both in this life and the next.


 


29)
Thus 
Bhaktivedanta
 sings the song of Sri 
Gita
, with the hope that hearing this, Krsna conscious pure
devotees will be pleased.
