TRANSLATION


1) Having sought refuge, I
bow at Sri 
guru's
 feet, from which, O brother, one gains
the wealth of 
Krsna-prema
.


 


2) To redeem the 
jivas
 
Nanda's
 son 
Hari
 appears in the world in the likeness of Sri 
guru
.


 


3) Guru and 
Krsna
 are glorified as one and so the guru's order should
always be taken to heart, knowing it is 
satya
.


 


4) Whoever has deep faith
in the guru's utterances as 
satya-jnana
 certainly
dwells in 
Vrajabhumi
.


 


5) Whoever courts Sri 
gurudeva's
 pleasure, no impediment
can cause him harm.


 


6) If 
Krsna

gets angry Sri 
guru
 can protect, but if guru gets
angry 
Krsna
 will neglect.


 


7) Guru is mother, guru is
father, 
guru
 is lord and master. Without Sri 
guru
 there is no recourse in this 
samsara
.


 


8) Never look upon Sri 
guru
 as a worldly man and never lend your ears to guru-
ninda
.


 


9) Never even look in the face
of them that speak ill of guru and avoid the place where guru 
ninda
 is heard.


 


10) Even if you see some
misconduct in Sri 
guru
, never disregard him for it.


 


11) One who thus cleaves to
guru's lotus-feet with firm 
devotion,
 carries with him
the great power to deliver the world.


 


12) Bow to such a guru's
lotus-feet, O brother, thereby all afflictions cease.


 


13) Whoever bows to Sri 
guru's
 lotus-feet every day, taking his feet upon my head I
salute him.


 


14) Hoping to retain guru's
lotus-feet within his heart, 
Sanatan
 
das
 makes guru 
vandana
.
