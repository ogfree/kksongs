TRANSLATION

1) Again and again I offer my obeisances unto Srila Narottama dasa Thakura.Â  He
is indeed a true follower of Lord Gauranga Deva. From his lotus mouth showers
the nectar of Sri Krsna's name from which emanates the wonderful effulgence
that destroys all ignorance.



2) Again and again I offer my obeisances unto Srila Narottama dasa Thakura. He
slightly smiles being absorbed in the bliss of chanting the holy names. His
teeth illuminate in every direction. Torrents of ecstatic tears constantly
bathe his face.



3) Again and again I offer my obeisances unto Srila Narottama dasa Thakura.
Just by hearing the sounds of mrdanga, his feet begin dancing. This captures
one's mind, providing such pleasure that one's hair stands on end.



4) Again and again I offer my obeisances unto Srila Narottama dasa Thakura. His
dancing is so beautiful that it conquers the pride of the Gandharvas and amazes
the assembly of all expert dancers and singers. Srila Narottama dasa Thakura
has thus initiated his own style of singing and playing the mrdanga called
manohara sahi.



5) Again and again I offer my obeisances unto Srila Narottama dasa Thakura.
Sometimes, in ecstasy he falls unconscious to the ground. Thus his effulgent
body is adorned by the dust as a decoration. Only by the greatest fortune may
one behold this divine sight.



6) Again and again I offer my obeisances unto Srila Narottama dasa Thakura.
Wherever his mercy flows, it will completely uproot the thirst for anything
other than Krsna, in all the people assembled there.



7) Again and again I offer my obeisances unto Srila Narottama dasa Thakura. His
faith and steadiness of devotion is as solid as a rock. His touch transforms
like the philosopher's stone. His words are as beneficial as the words of the
scriptures.



8) Again and again I offer my obeisances unto Srila Narottama dasa Thakura.
Whenever pious people see him they begin to ponder: "Is he an embodiment
of devotion or is he the incarnation of renunciation in this world?"



9) A person who is absorbed in the ocean of the pastimes of Sri Sri Radha and
Krsna should read these eight prayers aloud. By doing so, he will certainly
attain the same abode obtained by Srila Narottama himself.



10) By Srila Narottama's merciful glance, even such qualities as unrestrained
anger will be pacified. Let his beautiful limbs, the glow of his teeth, his
lotus- like face, his slight smile and his dancing be manifested in my heart.


 


11)
Made blissful by the exceedingly sweet sound of the mrdanga and karatalas and
drinking the honey of the glorification of Sri Gauranga-deva as his lotus feet
dance in a most enchanting fashion-May that Sri Narottama Thakura gratify me,
his lowly servant, by bestowing the fulfillment of my internal desire.
