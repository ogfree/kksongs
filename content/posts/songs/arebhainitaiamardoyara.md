TRANSLATION


1) O Brothers! My 
Nitai's
 mercy is limitless.
He wanders village to village giving love of God to one and all.



2) He always jokes with 
Advaita
 
Acarya
.
His whole body is made of love for 
Gauranga
. He is
always intoxicated with the divine mood of love, thus is unable to walk
properly. He raises his arms and sings "
Haribol
!"
and He sheds tears from His two lotus eyes.



3) Sri 
Nityananda
 is adorned with the 
tilaka
 on His forehead. He has curly hair matted with red
berries. A blue belt encircles His lion-like waist. His feet look red. He wears

anklebells
 on his reddish feet always making a
tinkling, tinkling sound.



4) His beauty enchants the whole world. He smiles and laughs while in the
divine mood of love! Lord 
Nityananda
 
Prabhu
 is my master. He's full of nothing but pleasure.
Thus, 
Vrndavana
 
Dasa
 sings
His glories.
