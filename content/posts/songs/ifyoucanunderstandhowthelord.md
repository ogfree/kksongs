Official
Name: Supreme Performances


Author:

Parivadi Dasa


Book
Name: None


Language:

English


 


LYRICS:


(1)


If you
can understand, how the Lord appears within this world


Can
you understand, how the Lord performs His mystic plays


Just
understand, how the Lord descends in every age


And
you will never return here again


You
will never come back to this world with many miseries


 


(2)


Lord
Krsna comes in any mystic form


His
incarnations are lighter than rays


To
save the faithful pious souls


And
remove the atheist class away.


Can
you understand. Just understand


 


(3)


The
Lord appears within this world


Just
like rising morning sun


His
praying grants you His Â“human feetÂ”


The
life and mind of everyone


 


(4)


He
incarnates as an avatar


When
true religion cannot be found


He
reestablishes higher laws


He
teaches through transcendental sound


Can
you understand. Just understand


 


(5)


All
attractive, of all in all


Creation,
Krsna has appeared


Inviting
all to join with him


In His
eternal happy home
