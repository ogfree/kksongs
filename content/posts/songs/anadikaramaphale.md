TRANSLATION


1) I
have fallen into the ocean of material existence as a result of my selfish
activities, which are without beginning, and I see no means of deliverance from
this great ocean of nescience. Day and night my heart burns from the poison of
these worldly activities, and on account of this my mind never finds any
satisfaction or happiness.


 


2)
Hundreds and thousands of desires, like nooses around my neck, constantly give
me misery and trouble. In that great ocean of nescience play the waves of
materialistic tendency. In this world there are many thieves and rogues, of
whom six are prominent; lust, anger, greed, illusion, and madness. They are
causing me great fear, and in this way my life is coming to an end.


 


3) The
two highway robbers, mental speculation and fruitive activity, have cheated me
and misled me, and finally they are throwing me into the ocean of misery. At
such a time as this, my dear Krsna, You are the only friend, and You are the
ocean of mercy and compassion. I have no strength to get out of this ocean of
nescience, so I pray to Your lotus feet that You will be kind and by Your
strength uplift me from this ocean of suffering.


 


4)
Accept this fallen servant and fix me as a particle of dust on Your lotus feet.
Kindly give me shelter to this Bhaktivinoda. O most merciful Lord, actually I
am Your eternal servant, but having forgotten this I have become bound up in
the network of maya.
