TRANSLATION


1)
Oh most powerful essential truth of the Vaisnava! Oh 
gushing

fountain of the bliss of the self! A similar truth to whose there is no equal
within this material world!


 


2)
On account of its own nature and characteristics it is famous in this world!
Please hear the description of the essence of this truth.


 


3)
The Parabrahman is the original eternal form of bliss, as well as a deep
reservoir of all transcendental mellows.


 


4-5)

How
 can any ordinary argument ever be able to touch
this truth? The truth of such transcendental mellows is extremely deep and
grave! It is attained only under the shelter of samadhi! Ah, such a wonderful
treasure is samadhi!


 


6)
Oh aspiring devotee! Just see the characteristics of samadhi with an unagitated
and peaceful mind. The truth of mellows is complete, absolutely undivided
supreme bliss. However, within that, the dealings between the 
taster
 of mellows and that which is tasted have an eternal
principle that is inseparable.


 


7)
The Supreme Lord is one without a second, and in His original form of Lord
Krsna He is the taster of transcendental mellows, and His object to be tasted
is Sri Radhika. Oh, the joy of the meeting of the Supreme subject and object!
And their transcendentally blissful meeting place is Sri Vrndavana.


 


8)
The special manifestation of Sri Vrndavana within the material universe is
revealed directly by Yogamaya. Those aspiring devotees who take the refuge of
This Vrndavana attain the eternal truth of ecstatic love. Indeed, the very name
of this model of Vrndavana here on the earth's surface is all-auspicious even
within the realm of Vaikuntha!


 


9)
If the living entity ever wants to continuously render service to the flowing
current of eternal bliss, he takes shelter of the feet of a bona fide spiritual
master.


 


10)
Then he rejects all types of dry, sapless worship which is devoid of
appreciation for higher sentiments; he reflects deeply on the nature of the
Absolute, and always arduously endeavors with taste to lovingly worship the
circle of the divine rasa dance in Vrndavana (the rasa-mandala).


 


11)
Â  
My friend, your false egoistic conception of being
a male is extremely feeble, for you are actually pure spirit soul! And your
real family comprises the beloved objects which are tasted by Krsna, namely the
eternal maidservants of Sri Radhika! Just realize 
the mellows

of such transcendental ecstasy! The enjoyment of maya is your downfall!!


 


REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:


This song is originally
composed as on single paragraph of prose-type lines. But it is not poetry, and
not really prose either. Anyway, it has been broken up into smaller sections
according to the flow of ideas to facilitate easier systematic translation and
reading.
