TRANSLATION


1) O Lord Krsna, the mercantile men
worshipped 
You
 by offering betel-nuts, aromatic scents
and various presents, and all the amazed women gazed upon You. O Lord, all
glories to 
You
.


 


2) O Lord Krsna, all glories unto 
You
. You enquired where 
Kamsa's

wonderful bow was kept, (and arriving at that place), 
You

picked it up, playfully strung it, and broke it.


 


3) O Lord Krsna, all glories unto 
You
. You enquired where 
Kamsa's

wonderful bow was kept, (and arriving at that place), 
You

picked it up, playfully strung it, and broke it.


 


4) O Lord Krsna, all glories unto 
You
. Although 
You
 were very eager
to go to the arena full of raised platforms constructed by 
Kamsa
,
the elephant 
Kuvalayapida
 obstructed Your path.
