TRANSLATION


1)
Lord Krsna, the supreme hero, has the most beautiful body which possesses all
good features. He has the 
most sweet
 smile, He
possesses extraordinary bodily strength, He is ever-youthfully beautiful, and
His grave plans and actions are very difficult for anyone else to understand.
He is expert at speaking meaningful words with all politeness, He is the most
pleasing talker, He is the source of all nectar, and He is a wonderful linguist

Who
 is fluent in all languages (even that of the
animals and birds). He is most expert in all kinds of artistic enjoyment (He
lives wonderfully at the topmost height of artistic craftsmanship), He is
cunning and clever in the art of performing various types of work
simultaneously, He is always joyful and untouched by any distress, and He is
always self-satisfied and peaceful.


 


2)
Krsna is grateful by never forgetting the service of His friends, He is simple
and liberal, He is the best, and is very famous for His good works. He is very
attractive to all women, He is very playful in amorous sports, and He possesses
an eternally fresh and youthful form. He is the full manifestation of complete
transcendental beauty, He is most expert at playing His all-attractive flute,
and He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.


 


3)
Krsna is most grave, gentle, forgiving, peaceful and forbearing, self-composed,
carefree and joking, the best lover, proud and restless, and the hero of all
women. He is always surrounded by five kinds of eternal servants: 1) 
ceta
 (spies), 2
)vita
 (dressing
attendants). 3) 
vidusaka

(clowns headed by 
Madhu-mangala
), 4) 
pitha-marda
 (back-massagers like 
Sridama
),
5) 
priya-narma-sakha
 (close friends.


 


4)
Thus served by these five kinds of helpers, the Son of the King of 
Vraja
 enjoys various mellows, sometimes as a husband or as
an illicit lover of others' wives. Being extremely thirsty to taste these 
rasas
, He enjoys playing the role of four kind of heroes,
as 
anukula
 (favorable), 
satha

(deceitful), 
drsta
 (impertinent), and 
daksina
 (clever). Thus He sports in the amorous garden
groves as the personification of all ecstatic mellows.
