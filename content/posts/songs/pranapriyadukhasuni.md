TRANSLATION


1)
Hearing that her lover, more 
dear
 to her than life,
was now unhappy, the moon-faced 
gopi
 asked about Him
with broken words in a choked voice. Tears streamed from her glistening lotus
eyes.


 


2)
She dressed in fine garments, anointed her limbs with fragrances, abandoned her
proud jealous anger, and went to meet Him. Fear of her kinsmen she left far
behind. To her elders she gave no thought. Keeping a vigil there, 
Krsna
 stayed always in her heart.


 


3)
Her great breasts and heavy hips forced her to walk very slowly. Her heart was
filled with longings. 
The path way very long.
 She
rebuked destiny for writing such things as her fate.


 


4)
Filled with longings, the beautiful 
gopi
 walked. To
dangers and obstacles she gave no thought. In the forest that beautiful
passionate 
gopi
 finally met Lord 
Krsna
.
So says 
Govinda
 
dasa
.
