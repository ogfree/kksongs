WORD
FOR WORD TRANSLATION: 
Sujanarvuda
Radhita Pada Yugam


                                    



TRANSLATION


1)
His lotus feet are served in devotion by multitudes of high, virtuous souls; he
is the establisher of the religion of the age (as Sri Krsna-sankirtana); he is
the presiding monarch (of the Visva-Vaisnava-Raja-SabhaÂ—the universal society
of the pure devotees that are the true Â‘kingsÂ’ or guides of all); and he is the
fulfiller of the most cherished desires of those who dispel fear (for all
souls). I make my obeisance unto the lotus feet of that illustrious great soul,
worshipable by one and allÂ— perpetually do I make my obeisance unto the
radiance emanating from the toenails of the holy feet of my lord
(Â“PrabhupadaÂ”).


 


2)
He is the leader of the fortunate souls blessed with the treasure of internal
pure devotion; he is greatly merciful upon the fallen souls, being their only
shelter; and his inconceivable holy feet are the shelter for the deceivers, by
deceiving them. I make my obeisance unto his lotus feetÂ—perpetually do I make
my obeisances unto the radiance emanating from the toenails of the holy feet of
my lord. 


 


3)
I make my obeisance unto his divine, charming yet commanding lofty form of
golden hue. That beautiful figure shames the mad ecstasy of golden lotus stems.
Venerated by tens of millions of Cupids, the moons of the toenails of my
Worshipful Divine Master reveal the beauty of his lotus feet. Perpetually do I
make my obeisance unto that effulgence emanating from the toenails of the holy
feet of my lord.


 


4)
Like the moon that delights the stars, he is surrounded by his circle of
personal servitors, making their hearts bloom in divine ecstasy. The malicious
non-devotees are made to flee in panic by the sound of his thunderous roar, and
the simple, inoffensive souls attain the ultimate fortune by accepting his
lotus feet. I make my obeisance unto him; perpetually do I make my obeisance
unto the brilliance emanating from the toenails of the holy lotus feet of my
lord.


 


5)
He has revealed the vast, magnificent beauty of Sri Gaura Dhama; he has broadcast
the tidings of the supreme magnanimity of Sri Gauranga throughout the whole
universe; and in the hearts of the fit recipients of his grace, he has firmly
established the lotus feet of Sri Gaura. I make my obeisance unto him;
perpetually do I make my obeisance unto the effulgence emanating from the
toenails of the holy feet of my lord.


 


6)
He is the eternal shelter and the Universal Guru for the souls surrendered unto
Sri Gauranga. Absorbed in the service of his Gurudeva, Sri Gaura Kisora, he
wholeheartedly adores Sri Bhaktivinoda Thakura. I make my obeisance unto him;
perpetually do I make my obeisance unto the effulgence emanating from the
toenails of the holy feet of my lord. 


 


7)
He is the illustrious personality to raise the flag that sings the glory of Sri
Rupa, Sanatana, and Sri Raghunatha. His glory is sung throughout the world as
non-different from the powerful personality of brilliant erudition, Sri Jiva.
And he has won the renown of being one with the hearts of Srila Krsnadasa
Kaviraja and Thakura Narottama. I make my obeisance unto him; perpetually do I
bow down to the brilliance emanating from the toenails of the holy feet of my
Divine Master.


 


8)
Bestowing his grace upon all souls, he is Hari-kirtana incarnate. As the
associate of Sri Gaura, he relieves Mother Earth of the burden of offences
committed upon her. And he is so gracious that his endurance of all beings
excels that of even a father. I make my obeisance unto himÂ—the mine of all
these qualities; perpetually do I bow down to the effulgence emanating from the
toenails of the holy feet of my Divine Master.


 


9)
Like a wish-fulfilling tree for his surrendered servitors (he fulfills their
heartÂ’s aspiration), even a tree is shamed by his magnanimity and forbearance. And
great personalities who are competent to confer boonsÂ—they, too, worship his
lotus feet. I make my obeisance unto him; perpetually do I bow down to the
radiance emanating from the toenails of the holy feet of my Divine Master.


 


10)
The crown-jewel of the paramahamsas, the Prince of the treasure of the supreme
perfection of life, Sri Krsna-prema, he accepted the robes of a mendicant
sannyasi just to deliver the fallen souls. The topmost tridandi sannyasis
attend his lotus feet. I make my obeisance unto him; perpetually do I bow down
to the effulgence emanating from the toenails of the holy feet of my Divine
Master.


 


11)
He is the dear most intimate follower of the Divine Daughter of Sri Vrsabhanu,
and I know myself as the most fortunate by taking the dust of his holy feet
upon my head. I make my obeisance unto his invincible, wondrously purifying
lotus feetÂ—perpetually do I bow down to the brilliance emanating from the
toenails of the holy feet of my Divine Master.
