TRANSLATION


Refrain:
Remembering and worshipping Lord Hari has been proven not to take away oneÂ’s
modesty. Who ever is protected by SyamaÂ’s lotus-like face is considered a
scholar of the Vedas.


 


1) To
honor Prahlada Maharaja, You have come as Nrsimha to kill Hiranyakasipu. To
honor Vibhisana, You have given him the duty of a king and killed Ravana to end
demoniac rule in Lanka during Your incarnation as Lord Ramacandra.


 


2) To
honor Gujarati devotee Narasi Mehta, You came personally to meet him and hold
his hand. To honor Dhruva Maharaja, You had given him the duty to be a Krsna
Conscious ruler and thus established him in this way.


 


3) To
honor Mira Bai, You transformed the poison given by her husband into nectar. To
honor Draupadi, You extended Yourself as extra cloth to protect Draupadi and
thus, help the Pandavas achieve their goal in the long run.


 


4)
Come! Let us worship Lord Hari together. Premala Dasa folds his two hands to
Lord Hari, the Lord who removes the sufferings of His devotees.


 


REMARKS/EXTRA
INFORMATION:


This
song is sung in Raga Gauri in Dipacandi tala.
