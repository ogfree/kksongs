TRANSLATION


1) O 
Krsna
, you understood
the sufferings of 
Your
 own family the 
Yadu
 dynasty, who were greatly harassed by the military
strength of 
Kamsa
. O My Lord, by the agency of 
Your
 own 
Yogamaya
 potency, You
personally became 
Devaki's
 seventh child.


 


2) O 
Krsna
, by the agency
of Your 
Yogamaya
, You became the Son of 
Devaki
 and 
Your
 incarnation as
Lord 
Balarama
 was transferred to the womb of 
Rohini
. O dear friend of Lord 
Balarama
,
O 
Krsna
, please protect me.


 


3) O 
Krsna
, when 
You
 became the eighth child of 
Devaki
,
Your splendor made Your mother appear very glorious and the presence of Your
transcendental potencies made Your father 
Vasudeva

become jubilant. 
you
 caused great fear and despair for

Kamsa
.


 


4) O 
Krsna
, O Absolute
truth, O Lord of the universe, manifesting Your transcendental form, which is
beyond the material nature, You received the prayers of Lord Brahma, Lord Siva,
and the other demigods. You also continually remained within the mind of 
Kamsa
.


 


5) O 
Krsna
, O
be-all-and-end-all for devotees, O only desired object of the devotees, by the
appearance of 
Your
 transcendental form, all the
desires of everyone become fulfilled. O Lord, you personally enter those who
take shelter of Your Holy Name or Your spiritual form. O Lord, simply by taking
birth here, 
You
 removed all the distresses of the
earth.


 


6) O 
Krsna
, You appeared
on the earth exclusively to perform 
Your
 pastimes and
remove the earth's burden. Your lotus feet are the ornament for the upper and
middle planetary systems. The demigods thus encouraged Mother 
Devaki
 by offering prayers to 
You
.
O 
Krsna
, all glories unto 
You
.
