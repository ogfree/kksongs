TRANSLATION


1)
If you want to be rid of the influence of the dog-like personality of kali,
then just sing the glories of the beautiful Son of Mother Saci (Saci-nandana).
He is the Savior of the kali-yuga (Kali-yuga Pavana), and He is
(Kali-bhay-nasana), the destroyer of all fear caused by the age of quarrel.


 


2)
He maddens Sri Gadhadara with His name, (Gadadhara-madana) He is the treasure
of the life of Sri Nityananda Prabhu (Nita'yer Prana-dhana), and He is the most
worshipable object of Sri Advaita Acarya (Advaiter Prapujita). He is affectionately
named Nimai by His mother, due to being born under a Nim tree, and He has been
named Visvambhara by His grandfather. He is the only Lord of Sri Srivasa
(Srinivas-isvar), and He steals the hearts of all the assembled devotees
(Bhakta-samuha-cita-cora).


 


3)
Lord Caitanya is the moon over Nadia (Nadiya-sasadhar), the Lord of Sri
Mayapura-dhama (Mayapura-isvar), and the divine propagator of His own name
(Nama-pravartana Sura). He is the instructor of family men (Grhijana-siksaka),
and He is also the hero of those who are in the renounced order
(Nyasi-kula-nayaka). He is the husband of the Goddess of Fortune (Madhava), and
He is over-flowing with the ecstatic moods and sentiments of Srimati Radharani
(Radha-bhava-pura).


 


4)
Lord Caitanya is the corrector and purifier of Sarvabhauma Bhattacarya
(Sarvabhauma-sodhana), and the deliverer of King Prataparudra
(Gajapati-tarana), the source of nourishment of Srila Ramananda Raya
(Ramananda-posana), and He is a great hero (Vira). He increases the ecstasy of
Srila Rupa Gosvami (Rupananda-vardhana), He is the maintainer and protector of
Srila Sanatana Gosvami (Sanatana-palana), He gladdens Haridasa Thakura
(Haridasa-modana) and He is very grave (Dhira).


 


5)
Lord Caitanya is the source of all the transcendental mellows of Vraja-dhama
(Braja-rasa Bhavana), He is the destroyer of all mischievous and wicked
mentality (Dustamata-satana), and He dissolves the mundane lust of the
deceitful insincere souls by His causeless mercy (Kapati Vighatana Kama). He
maintains and protects His pure Vaisnava devotees (Suddha-bhakta-palana), and
He chastises dry speculative knowledge (Suskajnana Tadana). He destroys
pretentious and hypocritical devotion (Chala-bhakti-dusana), and He is the
reservoir of pleasure (Rama).
