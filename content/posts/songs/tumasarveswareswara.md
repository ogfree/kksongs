TRANSLATION


1) O youthful son of the
King of 
Vraja
, You are Lord of all lords. According to
Your will, creation and destruction take place in the universe.


 


2) According to Your will
Lord Brahma creates, and according to 
Your
 will Lord 
Visnu
 maintains.


 


3) According to Your will
Lord Siva destroys, and according to 
Your
 will Maya
constructs the prison house of this world.


 


4) According to Your will
the living beings take birth and die, and according to 
Your

will they meet with prosperity and ruin, happiness and sorrow.


 


5) The tiny soul bound up
by Maya vainly struggles in the fetters of worldly desire. Without Your
sanction he is unable to do anything.


 


6) You are my only
protector and maintainer. Except for Your lotus feet there is no other hope for
me.


 


7) No longer confident of
my own strength and endeavor, I have become solely dependent on 
Your
 will.


 


8) 
Bhaktivinoda

is most poor, and his pride has been leveled. Now in accordance with 
Your
 will he lives and dies.
