LYRICS:


(1)


I have
turned my head and walked the other way for so long now


IsnÂ’t
it about time I turned to you?


IÂ’ve
been searching for something, someone to trust and to believe in


IsnÂ’t
it about time I returned to you?


IÂ’ve
been running here and there, trying to find pure love somewhere


Oh,
what I found has slipped through my hands


 


(2)


Now
within my heart within the very start IÂ’ve feeling so secure


Oh,
the sunny lotus smile runs through my eyes


Dancing
cascades of waterfalls of love are falling down, calling me again to look to
You


Soothing
moon beams of peacefulness, harmony are over me.


Reminding
that pure love will never end


Lord
Krsna, You are the eternal friend


 


(3)


Throughout
life, I felt everything IÂ’ve done is soaked in sin


Hoping
what I found wonÂ’t fade away


Now, everything
I have received, I want to give it all to Thee


Please
help me understand You more each day


Dancing
cascades of waterfalls of love are falling down, calling me again to look to
You


Soothing
moon beams of peacefulness, harmony are over me.


Reminding
that pure love will never end


Lord
Krsna, You are the eternal friend
