TRANSLATION


1) Oh my Lord 
Hari
! Your pure unalloyed devotee, who is uncompromisingly
devoted and attached to 
You
 only, considers any type
or material enjoyment or liberation to be insignificant. Simply by beholding
the beauty and 
opulences
 of 
Your

form made of eternity, knowledge and bliss, such a pure devotee considers all
other forms of so-called happiness to be just like small pieces of straw which
one sees strewn here and there in the gutter.


 


2) You always perform
different types of sportive pastimes in the company of pure devotees of this
caliber, for 
You
 are not able to tolerate separation
from them even for a moment. Please show 
Your
 gracious
favor to me and reveal to me who these great souls are, for I can find no
purpose for living without the shelter of their company.


 


3) When will I get the
vision of the rare treasure-like feet of all these pure devotees? If I could
just catch a glimpse of their lotus feet, then that would completely purify me
and rectify my sinister mind. 
Bhaktivinoda
 narrates this
prayer to 
You
, oh Lord: I will be able to get the
audience of such great souls only if Your causeless mercy comes upon me by Your
own sweet will.
