TRANSLATION


(Refrain)
My mind remembers Lord 
Hari
. He joked and performed
his 
lila
 during the 
rasa
.


 


1)
His infatuating flute resounded with honeyed tones like the nectar from his
quavering lower-lip; an ear ornament was tremulous on his cheek as his head
moved, [tremulous] at the corner of his quivering eye.


 


2)
His hair was surrounded with a ring of lovely peacock-tail feathers with
moon-eyes; [in] his lovely robe [He] was like a dark cloud colored with many
rainbows; my mind remembers 
Hari
.


 


3)
He had an eager desire for kisses from the mouths of the 
gopis
;
the blossom of his honeyed lower-lip is like the 
bandhuvija

[flower], [he was] beautiful on account of his radiant smile; my mind remembers

Hari
.


 


4)
A thousand cowherd girls were encircled by the shoots which are his 
very
 bristled arms; upon his chest and hands and feet, the
darkness was dispelled by the rays of his pearl ornaments; my mind remembers 
Hari
.


 


5)
His forehead had a mark of sandal on it which surpassed the moon moving in a
cluster of clouds; his broad chest was mean to crush the hearts. 
my
 mind remembers 
Hari
.


 


6)
His cheeks were adorned with enchanting ear rings of 
makaras

made of jewels; he was noble; he had a yellow robe; he was followed by a great
retinue of sages, men, spirits, and gods; my mind remembers 
Hari
.


 


7)
He was met beneath the splendid 
kadamba
 [tree]
allaying fear of the evil of the Kali Yuga; exciting me too somehow; in my
imagination; with his gaze which is like the tremulous; restless love-god; my
mind remembers 
Hari
.


 


8)
The song of Sri 
Jayadeva
 has the beauty of the
Enemy-of-
Madhu
, infatuating, so beautiful; it is
exactly suitable for the virtuous for remembrance of the feet of 
Hari
.
