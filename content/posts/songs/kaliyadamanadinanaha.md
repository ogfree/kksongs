TRANSLATION


(Refrain)

Krsna
, who is the Lord of the poor and meek and the
hero that vanquished 
Kaliya
, stays in a 
kadamba
 tree's shade on the 
Yamuna's

banks.


 


1)
(Lord 
Krsna
 says:) How many girls of 
Vraja
 have I seen? Still, this one girl is splendid like a
garland of unmoving lightning flashes, 


 


2)
O friend 
Subala
, I tell you: from that moment I no
longer know whether it is day or night.


 


3)
In that place were two or four beautiful girls splendid like glistening jewels.
But only one of those girls cast a spell on My heart.


 


4)
I keep that girl in my heart. My heart is filled with the smoke of 
Kamadeva's
 flames. Lost in the smoke, I cannot see the
directions.


 


5)
Moment after moment I am rapt in thinking of this girl. I know nothing but Her.
I am overcome by the fever of separation from Her.


 


6)
Day after day my body becomes more thin and emaciated. 
Govinda


dasa
 says: These are the signs of new love.

song is sung in Raga
