TRANSLATION


1)
O 
Krsna
, thus imitating the pastimes of a helpless human
child, charmingly kicking 
Your
 legs performing other
pastimes, You were observed by the 
gopis
.


 


2)
O 
Krsna
, pulling the tail of a calf, 
You
 would in turn be dragged about by him. The cowherd men
and women would then forget all their other 
activites

and become delighted by these childhood pastimes


 


3)
O 
Krsna
, in this way 
You

would greatly 
perpleÃ¸
 Your mother, who was intent on
performing her household duties. O Lord, Your great charm enchants Lord Brahma
and the other demigods and the beauty of 
Your
 childhood
amazes the entire universe. (All glories unto 
You
).
