REMARKS/EXTRA
INFORMATION:


Garga
Muni previously gave this mantra to the Vraja gopis. Herein, Sri Pradvipaka
Muni speaks the same kavaca to Duryodhana.Â  After bathing and dressing in clean
cotton garments, a person should sit on a kusa-grass mat, purify his hands with
mantras, bow down, and with fixed intelligence meditate on Lord Krsna's elder
brother, Lord Balarama while chanting this kavaca. This kavaca will ensure one
fill protection against Maya, as stated in the Garga Samhita.
