TRANSLATION


1) The
moonlike Lord Gaura Chanda arrives in Vrndavana while dancing, swaying to and
fro, and singing the glories of Lord Hari.


 


2) The
creepers adorning the trees of Vrndavana are overwhelmed with ecstatic love,
and they are speaking about the glories of Lord Hari. Flocks of birds who live
in the groves are singing the name of Lord Hari.


 


3)
Lord Gaura says, Â“Hari! Hari!Â” a female parrot responds, Â“Hari! Hari!Â” and then
all male and female parrots start singing a loud chorus of the name of Hari.


 


4)
Becoming intoxicated by the holy name, the deer come forward from out of the
forest. The peacocks and peahens are dancing and frolicking in ecstatic love.


 


5)
Lord Hari is in His heart, Lord Hari is in His meditation, and He always chants
the name of Hari with His voice. Gaura Chanda is intoxicated by ecstatic
mellows and rolls around on the ground while singing and singing Harinama.


 


6)
Arriving on the bank of the Yamuna River, He dances wildly while chanting
Â“Hari! Hari!Â” Mother Yamuna becomes so ecstatic that she arises and comes
forward to wash Lord GaurangaÂ’s feet.


 


Remarks/ Extra Information

This
rare Bangladeshi Gaura bhajan was popularized by Vaiyasaki Das through his 1986

Some
renditions of this song will have the first words as Â“
jhule jhule
gorā chāńda
Â”
instead of Â“
ḍhule
ḍhule gorā chāńda
.Â”
