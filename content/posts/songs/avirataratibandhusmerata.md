TRANSLATION


1)
Lord 
Krsna
 is very beautiful, His face always graced
by charming, amorous smiles. He looks as if He is being devoured by the waves
of 
RadhaÂ’s
 sidelong glances. His jubilant face
resembles the moon, His head is decorated with a peacock feather, and His
complexion is as charming as a monsoon cloud. In this way the Lord shines with
great splendor as He enjoys pastimes in the 
forest
 of 
Vrndavana
.


 


2)
Encircled by beautifully attired 
gopis
 on the 
YamunaÂ’s
 shore, 
Krsna
 has them
begin playing orchestral music on wind instruments, string instruments, and
drums. 
Then that King of Dancers gracefully dances in their
midst.
 In this way the Lord shines with great splendor as He enjoys
pastimes in the groves of 
Vrndavana
.


 


3)
When the peacock sings the first note of the musical scale and the cuckoo the
fifth, 
Krsna
 plays the most beautiful 
gandhara
 melody on His flute, thus destroying the composure
of everyone in the three worlds. In this way Lord 
Krsna
,
fragrant with musk, shines with great splendor as He enjoys pastimes in the
groves of 
Vrndavana
.


 


4)
With His matchlessly beautiful fingers 
Krsna
 grasps 
RadhaÂ’s
 fingers, and together they stroll about in a
luxuriant flower garden as the young girls of 
Vraja

sing in wonderfully melodious voices. In this way the Lord shines with great
splendor as He enjoys pastimes in the groves of 
Vrndavana
.


 


5)
As 
Krsna
 dances in the dancing arena near the slopes
of 
Govardhana
 hill, the peacocks worship Him with
their dancing, the bumblebees with their singing, and the bamboos with their
instrumental music as they sound in the wind. With His senses completely
absorbed in this simultaneous dancing, singing, and instrumental music, the
Lord shines with great splendor as He enjoys pastimes in the groves of 
Vrndavana
.


 


6)
By reciting descriptions of the confidential pastimes of 
Radha

and 
Krsna
, flocks of male and female parrots have
revealed these pastimes publicly and created a wonderful flooding river of
nectar. 
Krsna
 smiles as he whispers the parrotsÂ’
words in the ear of His beloved. In this way He shines with great splendor as
He enjoys pastimes in the groves of 
Vrndavana
.


 


7)

Krsna
 very sweetly flatters 
Radha
:
Â“Look! Seeing 
Your
 beautiful hair, this peacock has
become stunned. This black deer is bowing down to offer respect to the beauty
of 
Your
 lotus eyes. And this bumblebee is praising 
Your
 curling hair.Â” In this way the Lord shines with great
splendor as he enjoys pastimes in the groves of 
Vrndavana
.


 


8)
The multitude of 
gopis
, who are trembling with
amorous desire, serve 
Krsna
 by instructing Him in the

varous
 details of the best artÂ—the art of love.
Following their expert instructions, He has placed His broad arm on His
belovedÂ’s shoulders where 
Her
 hair has fallen. In this
way the Lord shines with great splendor as He enjoys pastimes in the groves of 
Vrndavana
.


 


9)
These eight prayers, which are the abode of the remembrance of 
Kunja-vihari
, are very beautiful because they are filled
with descriptions of His unparalleled pastimes. 
Kunja-vihari
,
who is worshiped by the supremely virtuous 
Radha
 and
who is the king of 
Vrndavana
 forest, leads the
delighted reader of these verses to His lotus feet.
