TRANSLATION


1) All glories, all glories
to our divine master, Sri 
Srimad
 
Bhakti


Prajnana
 
Kesava
 Maharaja,
whose supremely charming figure is the shelter for suffering humanity...


 


2) ...who is the very
embodiment of Vedanta, who is the annihilator of everything inauspicious, and
who boldly declared that Sri Vedanta is essentially a book of 
bhakti
.


 


3) Upon the lamp of the Sri

Gaudiya
 Vedanta 
Samiti
, the
splendid light of scriptural conclusion burns, and with that lamp your 
arati
 is perpetually performed.


 


4) That lamp is filled with
the oil of 
Bhaktivinoda-dhara
 Â– the current of the
teachings flowing from 
Bhaktivinoda
 Â– and teachings
of the followers of Sri 
Rupa
 are the incense that
delights the ten directions with its sweet fragrance.


 


5) His lotus face
simultaneously radiates stern gravity rooted in his profound realization of all
the 
sastras
 and softness born of his deep compassion.


 


6) The luster of his
beautiful bodily limbs, dressed in the robes of renunciation for the welfare of
the entire creation, vanquishes the effulgence of molten gold.


 


7) With many moods Sri 
Sajjana
 fans him with a 
camara

while Sri 
Gaura-narayana
 sings very sweetly at the
top of his voice.


 


8) From a distance the
foolish 
Trivikrama
 beholds the devotees performing
this immensely auspicious 
arati
.
