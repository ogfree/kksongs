TRANSLATION


1) That person who worships

Vrajendra-nandana
 makes his life successful. In the
three worlds there is none equal to Him. The Vedas cannot completely describe
His glories.


 


2) Whoever fails to worship
that Sri 
Madhava
 is taken to 
Yamaraja

after death and put in the hell called 
Raurava-loka

(where he is eaten alive by worms and insects). There is no one as sinful as him.


 


3) Since there is no
greater sinner than he throughout the universe, he cannot be delivered at any
time but continues to wander, performing temporary materialistic activities
that result in suffering.


 


4) Sri 
Locana


dasa
 states, "Only by my desire to obtain 
bhakti
 am I able to describe Sri 
HariÂ’s

qualities. I never wish to see the face of that person whose intelligence is
not fixed on 
Vrajendra-nandana
, the very essence and
embodiment of all 
rasa
.
