TRANSLATION


1) O Krsna, You climbed a
tall kadamba tree, and jumped into the lake where the serpent stayed. You
sported in that lake, angering Kaliya, and You were soon surrounded by many
angry snakes.


 


2) O Krsna, Your friends in
Gokula became drowned in bewilderment, and they were clearly observed to be
crying tears, distressed by the catastrophe which had befallen You, You, the
desired goal of the residents of Vraja.


 


3) O Krsna, by following
the footprints on the path, the people of Vraja came to the Kaliya lake, and
when they saw that You were in the serpent's grasp, they became almost dead
with lamentation. Nanda Maharaja and the others desired to commit suicide,
although Lord Balarama checked them.


 


REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:


This
song is based on Srimad Bhagavatam Canto 10 Chapter 16.
