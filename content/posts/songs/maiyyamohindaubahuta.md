TRANSLATION


(Refrain): Â“Oh my dear mother! My elder brother teases me as such. He
asks 
Me
 in mirth, Â‘Were you purchased or did Mother 
Yasoda
 really give birth to You?Â’Â”


 


1) Â“He is such a big brother that I cannot play with. He keeps asking 
Me
, Â‘who is Your mother and who is Your father?Â’Â”


 


2) Â“Â‘
Nanda
 Maharaja is fair skinned. Mother 
Yasoda
 is also fair skinned. How did you become so dark?Â’
My cowherd friends and 
Balarama
 laugh at 
Me
 and tease Me, because it is a joke for them.Â”


 


3) Â“You always scold 
Me
 very harshly and Elder
Brother gets away scot-free!Â” Hearing His enchanting son speak like this,
Mother 
Yasoda
 smiled.


 


4) Mother 
Yasoda
 said, Â“O Kana! Please pay no
attention to 
Balarama
. He likes to have fun and is
mischievous. I swear upon the mother cow: O 
Syama
,
the beloved Lord of 
Sura
 
Dasa
,
I am 
Your
 mother and You are my son!Â”
