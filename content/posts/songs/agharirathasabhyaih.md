TRANSLATION


1) When glorious Lord Krsna
entered the assembly, the people told Him, "The sun-god has come to see
Your feet."


 


2) 
Lord Krsna smiled and said,
"He is not the sun-god. He is King Satrajit holding a splendid
jewel." Hearing this, the people left. Satrajit did not approach Lord
Krsna, but quickly left also.    


 


3) Desiring to expose
Satrajit's selfish pride, Lord Balarama asked him to give the jewel to King
Ugrasena. When Satrajit gave it to his brother Prasena instead, Lord Krsna
laughed aloud.


 


4) When a lion in the jungle
killed Prasena, Lord Krsna became heavy at heart. Then Satrajit and his friends
spoke badly of Lord Krsna, thinking Him their enemy.


 


5) Searching with many exalted
persons, Lord Krsna found Prasena's body mauled to death by a lion. Following
the pawprints to a mountainous country, Krsna found the lion was also dead.


 


6) Lord Krsna found Jambavan's
footprints, but not the jewel. Leaving the other people behind, Lord Krsna
followed the footprints into a mountain cave.


 


7) Entering Jambavan's home,
and seeing the jewel, Lord Krsna wished to take it. Jambavan's son, the prince of
the Rksas, who had been playing with the jewel, ran to his nurse.


 


8) 
When Lord Krsna wanted to take
the jewel, the frightened and trembling nurse screamed. Intelligent Jamabavan
came at once and, his intelligence now clouded, attacked Lord Krsna.


 


9) 
Krsna and Jambavan fought for
twenty-eight days, but neither could defeat the other. After playing in this
way for a long time, Lord Krsna finally bestowed his mercy on Jamabavan as if
Jamabavan were His own son.


 


10) Pure-hearted Jambavan
surrendered to Lord Krsna, begged forgiveness for his offense of fighting with
the Lord, and with great devotion offered the jewel and his daughter,
Jambavati, to the Lord.


 


11) Returning with Jambavati
and the jewel, and giving the jewel to King Satrajit, Lord Krsna was happy at
heart. Embarrassed, King Satrajit decided to give his own daughter, as well as
the jewel, to Lord Krsna.


 


12) 
Lord Krsna accepted Satrajit's
daughter, Satyabhama, but not the jewel. With great devotion, Satyabhama had
endeavored to attain Lord Krsna. Then, in a conspiracy led by Akrura and
others, Satadhanva killed Satrajit, stole the jewel, and fled. Lord Krsna
pursued him, killed him, and later took the jewel from Akrura.


 


13) O Nanda, O king of Vraja,
Lord Krsna then met with the Yadavas and pleased them in many ways. Lord Krsna
is a full moon eternally rising in your family, a full moon that is the life of
all the eyes of Vraja.
