TRANSLATION


1)
O supremely blissful Madhava! The nectar is coming from Your lotus feet.


 


2)
Drinking that nectar, I blissfully sing Â“Hari! Hari!Â”


 


3)
With the name of Hari, I am binding a raft on which Lord Jagannatha will ferry
me across this ocean of material existence.


 


4)
My mind always remains at the lotus feet of that Lord Jagannatha who has very
large round eyes.


 


5)
In this way, I call out "Ha Krishna!" and give up my life. O husband of
Radharani, please deliver me.
