LYRICS:


(1)


hari
hari! kṛpā kori rākho nija pade


kāma
krodha chaya jane, loye phire nānā sthāne,


viṣaya
bhuÃ±jāya nānā mate


 


(2)


hoiyā
māyāra dāsa, kori nānā abhilāṣa,

kohe
dīna dāsa narottama


 


TRANSLATION


1) O
Lord Hari, O Lord Hari, please give me shelter at Your feet.  Six men
headed by lust and anger take me here and there and force me to enjoy my senses
in many ways. 


 


2)
Filled with material desires, a servant of material illusion, and my memory of
You fled far away, disguised as a Vaisnava, I wandered from house to house,
hoping to get some money. 


 


3)
When I suffered many miseries You tied Your rope of mercy around my neck and
dragged me to Vraja.  The illusory energy then forcibly untied those ropes
and again threw me into the well of material existence. 


 


4) If,
grasping his hair, You mercifully pull this person from illusion's well and
place him in the abode of Vraja, he will see that as his great good
fortune.  Otherwise his life will end.  Poor and fallen Narottama
dasa sings this song.
