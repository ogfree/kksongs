TRANSLATION


1)
Then Sri 
Caitanya
 
Mahaprabhu

began to speak to 
Srivasa
 with very affectionate and
sweet words. He said, "My dear 
Srivasa
, you are
actually 
My
 very old servant. Indeed, I am staying in
this world only due to your unalloyed love for 
Me
."


 


2)
"You, 
Srivasa
 
Pandita
,
are factually the commander-in-chief of all of 
My

devotees. Today your glorious character will be acclaimed throughout the three
worlds."


 


3)
"You are never subject to the imprisoning bondage of 
Mayadevi
,
the proprietress of this prison-like material world. Indeed, this fact is
attested to by all the people of the world."


 


4)
"You have dedicated unto Me all of your wealth, followers, body and
household paraphernalia, and thus you have become most joyful by being so
nicely situated in My eternal service."


 


5)
Â“The whole of your existence in this world is only for the purpose of
nourishing 
My
 eternal pastimes. Thus your ideal
behavior as a transcendental family man is exemplary for instructing all the
materialistic householders."


 


6)
"Sri 
Nityananda
 
Prabhu

and I are so much obliged to you due to your pure love for 
Us
.
Indeed, 
We
 know that you enjoy great happiness by
considering Us to be your very own sons."


 


7)
"We are truly your eternal sons, for 
We
 see that
you are not at all attached to your temporary sons, who are all subject to the
material conditions of creation and destruction."


 


8)
"Because of your pure devotion I am eternally indebted to you. And because
of your saintly character you are also quite deserving of 
My

indebtedness."


 


9)
Hearing these loving words of Sri 
Caitanya
 
Mahaprabhu
, this rascal 
Bhaktivinoda

now begs at the feet of 
Srivasa
 
Thakura

in humble supplication to receive the lotus feet of Lord 
Gauranga
.
