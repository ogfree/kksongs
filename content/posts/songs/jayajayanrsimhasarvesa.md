TRANSLATION


(Refrain):
All Glories, All Glories to the Supreme Lord, Lord Nrsimhadeva! He is the
destroyer of fear, strong, and is merciful to Prahlada Maharaja.


 


1) The
sun and moon are His eyes. He appears as half man, half lion. He the complete
Supreme Whole, present both internally and externally. His throne is the Great
Serpent, Adi Sesanaga. He has countless transcendental qualities, and is
merciful to Prahlada Maharaja.


 


2) He
is very powerful and great. He is one without equals, such that even Lord Siva
respectfully offers obeisances to Him. With His sharp and diamond-like nails,
He killed the evil demon (Hiranyakasipu) by disemboweling him. He is merciful
upon Prahlada Maharaja.


 


3) Sri
Laksmi-Devi resides on His left lap. He is more beautiful than a million
Cupids. He resides in Sri Venkatagiri, the abode of Lord Venkatesvara. His
pastimes are the most pure. He is merciful upon Prahlada Maharaja.


 


Remarks/ Extra Information
: 


This
bhajan is very popular amongst the worshippers of Sri Venkatesvara in South
India and Carnatic musicians.


 


It is
sung in Carnatic Raga Mohanam (equivalent to Raga Bhupali in the North Indian
tradition).
