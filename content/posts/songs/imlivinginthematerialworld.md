LYRICS:


I'm
living in the material world 


Living
in the material world 


 


CanÂ’t
say what I'm doing here 


But I
hope to see much clearer, 


 


After
living in the material world 


I got
born into the material world 


Getting
worn out in the material world 


 


Use my
body like a car, 


Taking
me both near and far 


Met my
friends all in the material world 


 


Met
them all there in the material world 


John
and Paul here in the material world 


 


Though
we started out quite poor 


We got
'Richie' on a tour 


Got
caught up in the material world


 


From
the Spiritual Sky, Such sweet memories have I


To the
Spiritual Sky How I pray


Yes I
pray that I won't get lost or go astray


 


As I'm
fated for the material world


Get
frustrated in the material world


Senses
never gratified Only swelling like a tide


That
could drown me in the material world


 


From
the Spiritual Sky, Such sweet memories have I


To the
Spiritual Sky How I pray


Yes I
pray that I won't get lost or go astray


 


While
I'm living in the material world


Not
much 'giving' in the material world


Got a
lot of work to do


Try to
get a message through


And
get back out of this material world


 


I'm
living in the material world


Living
in the material world


I hope
to get out of this place


by the
Lord Sri KrsnaÂ’s grace


My
salvation from the material world
