TRANSLATION


1) I offer my respectful 
obeisances
 to the prince of the 
gopas
,
who is more handsome than millions of 
Kamadevas
, who
is more splendid than a blossoming blue lotus, and whose pastimes enchant the
entire world. 


 


2) Let me offer my
respectful 
obeisances
 to Lord 
Krsna
,
who wears a 
gunja
 necklace, who is splendid as a
sapphire, and who is a regal elephant on the 
Yamuna's

shore.


 


3) I offer my respectful 
obeisances
 to 
Balarama's
 younger
brother, who is the reservoir of all transcendental bliss, who wears a garland
of 
kadamba
 flowers, and who is attained by pure love.


 


4) O Lord whose shoulders
are splendid with earrings, O Lord who gracefully places the flute to 
Your
 mouth, O swan who swims in the 
Manasa

Lake of 
Radha's
 thoughts, O flower-crown of 
Vraja
, I offer my respectful 
obeisances

unto You.


 


5) O Lord who wears a peacock-feather
crown, O Lord whose hand is decorated with a staff, O Lord who wears flower
earrings, O lotus-eyed Lord, I offer my respectful 
obeisances

unto 
You
. 


 


6) I offer my respectful 
obeisances
 to Lord 
Govinda
, whose
heart is pleased by the sweetness of the 
madhvika

nectar of 
Radha's
 love, and who is more handsome than
a host of 
Kamadevas
.
Â 



 


7) I offer my respectful 
obeisances
 to Lord 
Hari
, who is
decorated with the nectar of transcendental amorous pastimes, who wears 
karnikara
 earrings, and whose splendid luster makes one
mistake Him for a host of new monsoon clouds.


 


8) I offer my respectful 
obeisances
 to the Lord, whose flute openly stole the jewels
of the 
gopis
' chastity, who wears a 
kahlara
 flower in His hair, and who broke the demon 
Sankhacuda
.


 


9) I offer my respectful 
obeisances
 to the prince of the 
gopas
,
who is a bumblebee tasting the honey of the 
bandhuka

flower of 
Radha's
 lips, and who is a lion against the
elephants of the demons.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 



 


10) O Lord whose peacock
feather is as charming as a rainbow, O Lord who enlivens the world, O dark
cloud embraced by the lightning flash of Sri 
Radha
, I
offer my respectful 
obeisances
 unto 
You
. 


 


11) O moon shining on the
lotus flowers of the eyes of the 
gopis
 blinded by
love, O Lord decorated with 
kunkuma
 
tilaka
, O Lord dressed in yellow garments, I offer my
respectful 
obeisances
 to 
You
.



 


12) I offer my respectful 
obeisances
 to the dear friend of 
Gokula
,
who is a cloud that extinguishes the blazing forest fire of 
Indra's

pride, and who made the king of mountains into a toy ball. 


 


13) Weighted down by the
heavy boulder of my offenses, I am drowning in the ocean of pain. O merciful
Lord 
Krsna
, please be kind to me, a wicked, sinful
man.


 


14) Although I am a mine of
offenses, and although I cannot tell right from wrong, I still hope for 
Your
 mercy. O Lord 
Madhava
, please
be merciful to me.
