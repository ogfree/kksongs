TRANSLATION


1) Becoming a disciple, 
Arjuna
 listened to the 
Bhagavad-gita
.
All his ignorance dissipated as well as his material bondage.


 


2) His material bondage was cut, but
he was not dressed as a 
sannyasi
. The householders
understand the 
Gita's
 meaning this way.


 


3) The perfection of mantras was Â“I
will do what you say.Â” Therefore, the war that he fought brought him an
increase in fame.


 


4) 
Vaisnavas

have no desires. They all chant on beads. What kind of 
Vaisnava

is 
Arjuna
 in the middle of the material world?
