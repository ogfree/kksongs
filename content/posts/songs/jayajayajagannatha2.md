jaya jagannātha śacī ke nandan 

tribhūvana jinake kare caraṇa vandan

TRANSLATION


1) All
glories, all glories to the dear son of Jagannatha Misra and Saci Devi! All the
three worlds offer prayers unto His lotus feet.



2) In Nilacala He holds the conch shell, disc, club, and lotus flower, while in
the town of Nadiya He holds a sannyasi staff and waterpot.



3) It is said that in olden times, as Lord Ramacandra, He killed the demon
Ravana. Then later, as Lord Krsna, He revealed the splendorously opulent
pastimes of Goloka.

 


4) It
is He who has come. He has come! Oh, from Vraja He has come to Nadiya.
Accepting the mood and luster of Sri Radha, He has come from Vraja to Nadiya.
He has come! Now Lord Govinda, the cowherd boy, has come as Lord Gauranga. He
has come distributing the Hare Krsna Mahamantra!


 


5)
Vasudeva Ghosh says with folded hands, Â“He who is Gaura is He who is Krsna is
He who is Jagannatha.Â”
