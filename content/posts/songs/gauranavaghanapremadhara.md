TRANSLATION


1)
The new 
raincloud
 of Lord 
Gaura

showered a monsoon of ecstatic spiritual love, a monsoon that delighted the
thirsty souls suffering from the burning heat.


 


2)
The ploughman of devotional service plowed the hard earth of the sinnersÂ’
wicked hearts and broke up its hardness. Then the plowman watered that ground.
Then the first sprout of ecstatic spiritual love appeared.


 


3)
Lord 
Nitai
 nourished that sprout with the waters of
devotional service. Day by day the tree of ecstatic spiritual love grew and
grew.


 


4)
Finally that tree bore the fruit of ecstatic spiritual love, a fruit that
delivers every soul. Alas! 
Ananta
 
dasa

could not taste that fruit. His own past karma cheated him of that fruit.


 


REMARKS/EXTRA INFORMATION:


Ragas

Mangala
 or 
Miyan
 
Malhara
 
are
 the ideal choices for
this song.
