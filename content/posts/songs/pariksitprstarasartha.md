TRANSLATION


1) O Lord Krsna, when King 
Pariksit
 asked 
Sukadeva
 
Gosvami
 why You engaged in the Rasa-dance, the sage replied
that You are full of unlimited transcendental potency and opulence, and that
You manifest Your eternal pastimes, which are full of transcendental knowledge
and bliss, in order to liberate the saintly devotees aspiring for liberation
and to benedict those who are already liberated.


 


2) O Lord Krsna, You
greatly glorified the 
gopis
, and 
You

were not at any time the reservoir of envy or ill-feelings towards the cowherd
men (considering them Your rivals). You were the life-breath of the cowherd's wives,
who possessed homes and children by the grace of their husbands. O Lord, please
be merciful to me.
